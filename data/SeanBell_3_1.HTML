<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REBUFFED BY ONE woman, a lovelorn student took another coed hostage at City College yesterday and held a gun to her head in a crowded waiting room, cops said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said if anybody moves he'll kill me,&quot; the hostage, Elaishun Martin, 21, told the Daily News. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The harrowing incident unfolded just after 2 p.m., when the suspect, Kirk Hanley, 21, got into an argument with a 20-year-old woman who rejected him for a date, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman became frightened by Hanley's reaction and went to the Wille Administration Building on the Harlem campus, where she works in the financial aid office. She alerted a counselor, who contacted campus security. Campus officers called the NYPD for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security officers confronted Hanley in a waiting room outside the financial aid office, asking him to leave with them, campus spokeswoman Mary Lou Edmondson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said Hanley became agitated, pulled a pistol from his book bag and randomly grabbed Martin by her hair, pointing the gun at her head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, a psychology student, said Hanley mumbled something about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> police shooting case and yelled at the arriving NYPD cops, &quot;Are you going to make me do this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In &quot;his suicide notes and his mutterings, he said he wanted to be killed by a cop. He said he wanted to go down like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; a campus security source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communications student Johnny Ochoa, 19, said Hanley kept repeating, &quot; 'I've been waiting 21 years. All I needed was help.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops ordered the 15 to 20 students in the area to hit the floor, said Ahmed Ishtiak, 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It happened so suddenly, in a second,&quot; Ishtiak said. &quot;Everyone was running.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Hanley, of Flatbush, Brooklyn, released Martin, but did not immediately follow orders to lay down his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was just walking around and he put the gun to his head,&quot; said Ishtiak, adding that Hanley was yelling, &quot;I don't want to live anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops screamed at Hanley, &quot;Drop the gun and no one will hurt you.&quot; When Hanley dropped the weapon, police tackled him and dragged him out of the building, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Hanley's weapon turned out to be pellet gun that looked like a real .45-caliber pistol. Cops said Hanley had a suicide note in his pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was taken to the psychiatric ward at St. Luke's Hospital for observation. Cops later charged him with criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his MySpace page, Hanley cryptically writes that he is a &quot;fatal error, the Frankenstein of the 21st century, a God-like nonbeliever, the product of a racist, hypocritical world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me life is nothing but a meaningless coincidence,&quot; he adds. &quot;Every breath just brings us closer to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanley idolized mass killers, according to his Web page. As his heroes, he lists Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and &quot;Cho&quot; - an apparent reference to Seung-Hui Cho, the madman who killed 32 at Virginia Tech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not supposed to be at work and receive a phone call like this,&quot; Martin's mother, Helen Martin of Harlem, told The News last night as she emerged from the 26th Precinct stationhouse with her daughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">SEAN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">BELL'S</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family held a raucous meeting last night in a Manhattan union hall with hundreds of supporters to organize a massive show of civil disobedience aimed at shutting the city down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be several actions within the next 10 days,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton. &quot;These policemen should know they have not, I repeat not, closed this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's dad said any protests will be peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want violence, it only hurts ourselves,&quot; William Bell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants said that amid all the angry denunciations of the police and the acquittal of the three detectives who killed Bell on his wedding day, committees were formed and loose plans were struck for a boycott of city businesses and a march on the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's organized,&quot; William Bell said. &quot;It's going to be more organized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, who organized the meeting at the W. 43rd St. headquarters of the Service Employees International Union, vowed to stage citywide protests after the three cops were acquitted Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton and other African-American leaders are attempting to pressure federal prosecutors into trying Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper for violating Bell's civil rights. And they have one of New York's most powerful unions on their side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valerie Bell, Sean's mother, an insurance investigator for Jamaica Hospital Home Care Department, is a member of 1199 SEIU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union members threw their support behind the Bell family following the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting, taking part in protest marches, holding press conferences at their headquarters, and helping shoulder the burial costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various pro-Bell groups also are going online to organize a national boycott of stores and gas stations from May 19-23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing that the establishment understands is the almighty dollar,&quot; says one e-mail message in circulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the planned protests, Michael Palladino, President of the Detectives' Endowment Association, said, &quot;The same legal system that grants people the right to lawful assembly has found our three detectives not guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The large number of New Yorkers who tune in to public radio early in the morning for information and relief might have been a little surprised yesterday to hear a 4 1/2- minute segment on Miley Cyrus' controversial Vanity Fair picture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, for that matter, five minutes on the red-hot Grand Theft Auto video game released yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's all part of &quot;The Takeaway,&quot; a new show that shares time on WNYC (93.9 FM, 820 AM) with &quot;Morning Edition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosted by veterans Adaora Udoji and John Hockenberry, &quot;The Takeaway&quot; is heard from 6-7 a.m. on WNYC-FM and 8-9 a.m. on WNYC-AM. Come the end of June, it will expand to 8-10 a.m. on WNYC-AM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its goal is to be a little breezier, looser and less &quot;packaged&quot; than the classic public radio sound, with the idea of attracting younger listeners. So yesterday's first hour seemed to provide a pretty good sample of what it's aiming for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, &quot;Takeaway&quot; did five minutes on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding voter ID requirements. Then it did five minutes of mild incredulity about the annual farm subsidy bill, to which most people, including legislators, pay little attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no headline segments &aacute; la WINS or WCBS-AM, but there was a brief mention of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case and several sports reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hockenberry used his wry tone on pop culture reports, joking that Grand Theft Auto players get into the game when they aren't waterboarding someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, even the fluffiest of pop culture topics had a public radio flavor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Cyrus report, culture critic Mary Elizabeth Williams - whose two 9-year-olds are mega-fans of Hannah Montana - gently explained how the fury over the picture is a big deal about not much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that Cyrus, her family and Disney people were all in on the shoot, and that its style would hardly surprise anyone who knows the work of photographer Annie Liebovitz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything,&quot; said Williams, &quot;the picture is a little boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is exactly what Udoji and Hockenberry do not want said about their program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAREWELL, BIG RON: Big Ron O'Brien, most recently at WOGL in Philadelphia and heard years ago on WNBC and WXLO, died Sunday of pneumonia at the age of 56.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Seinberg, who runs the radio Web site &quot;Big Apple Airchecks,&quot; is producing a tribute to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUMMER JAM LINEUP: The June 1 &quot;Summer Jam&quot; produced by WQHT (97.1 FM) at Giants Stadium will feature Kanye West, Rihanna, T Pain, Ray J &amp; Yung Berg, the Dream, D Block featuring Styles P &amp; Sheek Louch, Lil' Wayne featuring Gym Class Heroes, and Public Enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND THE DIAL: Brian Phillips, most recently heard mornings on WHTG (106.3 FM) at the Jersey Shore, will do 7 p.m.-midnight weeknights at WRXP (101.9 FM). ... The WRKS (98.7 FM) radiothon for St. Jude's last weekend raised more than $149,000. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill DiFazio talks about day labor and homeless youth in his May Day special this morning, 10 a.m., on WBAI (99.5 FM).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN OFFICER from Clifton, Michael Oliver, had the most emotional reaction of the three New York City detectives acquitted Friday in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a 23-year-old Queens man shot in the wee hours before his wedding. Oliver, who had been charged with the gravest offenses, broke down and cried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver had been through a tense 17 months since Bell died in a hail of police bullets. The case against him looked the worst. He was singled out as the source of nearly two-thirds of the 50 rounds police detectives fired at Bell and his friends as they left his bachelor party. Oliver fired a total of 31 rounds, 15 of them after he had reloaded his weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one should be surprised by the final verdict. The sad truth of American justice is that police officers rarely are convicted when they kill civilians. In a police shooting trial, the odds-on favorites are the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word justice has a hollow ring in this case - and in dozens of others that follow the same pattern. Police are infrequently charged. If they are charged, acquittal is the likely outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last officer indicted and tried in Bergen County, Gary Spath, was acquitted of reckless manslaughter after he'd shot a black teenager, Phillip Pannell, in the back in Teaneck in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, the Bergen County prosecutor was slow in getting a grand jury to indict state parks police Officer Chad Walder. And now, two years after Walder shot Emil Mann to death in Ringwood State Park, there's still no trial date set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the infamous New York case involving the killing of the unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo in 1999, police officers walked free after a trial that revealed they'd shot 41 rounds into a dimly lit Bronx hallway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflexive response</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman found Oliver and two other detectives tried in the Bell case not guilty on all charges. Maybe there was no carelessness or incompetence, which is what Cooperman said. But there was fear and confusion that led to rapid, random, reflexive shooting and Bell's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rutgers Law School Professor Louis Rabeson cites some factors that have ensured the process is weighted in favor of the police in almost every case. Police are like professional witnesses familiar with the courts, while less experienced civilians are learning as they go, Rabeson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, police have time to &quot;harmonize&quot; their views so that there are no clashing accounts. They don't have to make any official statements immediately after their involvement in an incident. Cooperman found in his ruling that key witnesses for the prosecution had told slightly different versions of the story to the grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabeson said law enforcement tends to have more credibility with a judge not only because of frequent interaction, but also because police are perceived to be doing a heroic job that puts them in death's path. That image is hard to challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Bell case, the police gained further advantage by having the judge hear the case without a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When there's been a lot of publicity, or the nature of the crime has been horrendous, it's likely to have a very strong emotional impact on the jury but less of an emotional impact on the judge,&quot; Rabeson said. &quot;In those situations, it's not a bad strategy to ask for a judge rather than a jury trial, and I'm sure that was a tactical decision in this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Bell's advocates will probably seek a federal trial of the police for civil-rights violations, more oversight of the Police Department and a permanent statewide special prosecutor.This region has a problem that's become obvious: Police officers are rarely convicted when they are charged in the killings of civilians, mostly minority men. I'm surprised that it doesn't happen more frequently, given that history shows the courts are so solidly on the side of law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUEENS judge who cleared the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cops unleashed his fury yesterday on those who violated his privacy after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman - whose decision last Friday brought him international headlines as well as the praise of police supporters and the scorn of the Bell family - lambasted reporters who descended on his neighborhood over the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I resented the fact that people came to my home on the weekend, bothering my neighbors; I'm really very upset about that,&quot; an irate Cooperman said by phone from his chambers in the Kew Gardens courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I haven't accused anyone falsely; I did not spend $4,000 on prostitutes,&quot; Cooperman added, in an apparent reference to the media blitz that surrounded disgraced former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. &quot;That's not journalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 74-year-old judge, who decided the verdict without a jury at the defendants' request, has declined multiple interview requests since the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In explaining his verdict in court Friday, Cooperman criticized the testimony of shooting survivors Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, along with other prosecution witnesses, saying their &quot;credibility was seriously impeached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge cited the witnesses' criminal convictions, motive to lie and demeanor on the witness stand, apparently referring to Guzman's hostile testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the verdict, a phalanx of cops and court officers guarded Cooperman's Queens home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who called Cooperman's decision &quot;an abortion of justice,&quot; urged protesters to get arrested &quot;whether it is on Wall St., the judge's house or at 1 Police Plaza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown and lawyers for acquitted Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper praised Cooperman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who fired 31 shots, called the verdict &quot;fair and just,&quot; and Brown called Cooperman &quot;one of this county's most experienced and respected judges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In prior interviews, Cooperman said he once considered becoming a journalist, but yesterday he said: &quot;I am so glad I did not go to Columbia Journalism [School] and I picked the law. I had misgivings about that, but not anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among its target audience of 18- to 34-year-olds, Duran's squad pulls more than 12% of the audience, meaning about one person in eight is listening to Z100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The station itself is also having a strong run, reflecting what Senior Vice President of Programming Tom Poleman calls &quot;the 10-year cycle ... when great mainstream pop music comes back around.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the best news for Z100 is that the station does even better in the Portable People Meter (PPM) system Arbitron is putting into play this fall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DJ Envy of WQHT (97.1 FM) was one of several who targeted the comment by Mayor Bloomberg and others that &quot;there were no winners or losers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think when you're dead, there was a loser,&quot; said Envy. &quot;When your fiance will never seen you again, there was a loser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Lover of WWPR (105.1 FM) said the only positive thing he could see was that &quot;we didn't burn our neighborhoods down. We kept it under control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Slade of WRKS (98.7 FM) focused on news developments, including the call by 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement for a permanent special prosecutor to deal with cases of police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angriest host was Miss Jones of WQHT, who wished lethal illness on Michael Palladino, president of the New York Detectives Association. She felt he showed a callous attitude toward the victims when he was issuing a statement after the verdict commending the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After she said that, a city police officer called to say that confrontational rhetoric is the path to more bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She snapped back, &quot;If you get a hundred, we'll get 50 of you. ... Blue doesn't mean anything here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after a trio of detectives were cleared of killing the young bridegroom in a 50-bullet barrage, Joseph Guzman led Rep. John Conyers through the pouring rain from the Kalua Cabaret - the Queens strip club where Bell had held his bachelor party - to the spot where he died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We walked down the corner here, we turned the corner,&quot; Guzman, who was shot 16 times and leaned heavily on his cane as he walked, told Conyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stopped when they got to the spot on Liverpool St. in Jamaica where Bell was killed - and where dozens of bouquets and candles lay soaking in the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With them were Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, his parents and Trent Benefield, the other survivor of the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to make sure justice is served, and we send a message not just to law enforcement but to young people that these types of tragedies have to end in this country,&quot; Conyers told them earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Conyers, a Democrat and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told them as they huddled under umbrellas was out of the earshot of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Conyers turned to go, Ken Frydman, a spokesman for the Detectives' Endowment Association, approached him and said, &quot;I'd like to respectfully request a meeting with the chairman on behalf of the [association].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are who you say you are, I accept,&quot; replied Conyers, who had been asked by the Rev. Al Sharpton to visit the shooting scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton is trying to pressure federal prosecutors into trying the detectives for violating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African-American community is still seething after Detectives Marc Cooper, Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora were acquitted Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper apologized for the shooting after the verdict; the other two haven't. All still face departmental hearings and civil suits and remain on modified duty, deprived of their guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first television interview since the verdict, Nicole Paultre Bell told Dominic Carter on New York 1's &quot;Inside City Hall&quot; that she accepted Cooper's apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looked like he was sorry for what happened,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield also accepted the apology, but Guzman shook his head and suggested &quot;you should get him in here to find out what really happened.&quot; Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, is riding a desk at the Manhattan Detective Borough. Cooper is doing clerical work at Detective Borough Bronx, and Isnora is performing similar duties at Detective Borough Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, was killed on his wedding day. While legal experts said it's unlikely the feds would intervene, Sharpton and the Bell family aren't giving up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're the shot, not the shooters,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, former New York Civil Liberties Union head Norman Siegel and members of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, an advocacy group for black cops, proposed a permanent state special prosecutor with the power to investigate allegations of police brutality and corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said there was no need for a special prosecutor. Many in the African-American community believe prosecutors made a halfhearted attempt to convict the cops.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 1999, then-state Sen. David Paterson was arrested on disorderly conduct charges during a series of demonstrations against the cop-shooting death of unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, almost a decade later - no longer a rabble-rousing member of the Senate minority, but rather New York's first black governor - his views on civil disobedience have changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson told the Daily News yesterday that he would not approve if the Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the Diallo days of rage, follows through on his vow to &quot;close this city down&quot; with mass demonstrations in response to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I certainly would not be in favor of that,&quot; Paterson said of any shutdown - even if the protests are peaceful, as vowed. &quot;People are trying to go to work. We're trying to conduct commerce here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the perspective of management of government, you never want your city shut down,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor, who admits to being &quot;surprised&quot; that, given the number of shots fired, the three officers charged in the Bell shooting were cleared, insists things are different in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand the historical significance of civil disobedience, and too many times that was the only way to effect change,&quot; he said. &quot;However, in this case, there is a continuing federal investigation and interdepartmental investigation. . . . We know a judge determined there was no crime. We accept that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reminded that in a previous political life, he likely would have been front and center in the actions Sharpton is planning, Paterson was unmoved. His role now is to &quot;hear what the demonstration is about and recognize the symbolism of it,&quot; he said. To participate as governor would be &quot;a little pretentious,&quot; Paterson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton indicated he was a bit surprised by Paterson's change - but said he still respects the governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sentiment we express is with Dr. King's style of civil disobedience in mind, which is the same sentiment he [Paterson] had in 1999 when he and his dad [Harlem political leader Basil Paterson] joined me in this style of Dr. King civil disobedience at 1 Police Plaza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's concern about Sharpton's tactics is yet another example of his remaking himself as he puts his stamp on the office he unexpectedly ascended to following the spectacular prostitution-linked fall of Eliot Spitzer last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his days as a senator, Paterson sponsored legislation to require police to shoot to harm rather than kill - a move opposed by Spitzer and one that sparked the ire of police unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has since disavowed the measure and withdrawn his active support for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson is widely viewed as a liberal, given his opposition to the death penalty and support of gay marriage and abortion rights, but Sharpton has referred to the new governor as &quot;probably the most conservative of our generation of black leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;David is the one that if there was a police brutality case would say, 'I'm going to call the police unions as well; we must have balance,' &quot; Sharpton said in Albany just prior to Paterson's March 17 swearing-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't think of an issue that David didn't try to moderate,&quot; the rev said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paterson said he spoke to Sharpton on Friday after Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor said he called Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, after the verdict and will meet with her soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as it's desired, I will meet with her,&quot; Paterson said. &quot;Whether or not a crime was committed, she's still a victim. She's a victim because her fianc&eacute; was killed. It may or may not have been a crime, but everyone agrees his death was tragic. He wasn't carrying a weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's pal Joseph Guzman, who testified about being shot by police the night Bell was killed, has also felt threatened - saying he's been followed by strange people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tell me how we explain why we must get security for Mr. and Mrs. Bell's home because for some people, it's not enough to take their child,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation came as law enforcement sources confirmed that the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau was investigating taunting phone calls made to Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, that may have originated from the offices of the Sergeants Benevolent Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rachel Noerdlinger, a spokeswoman for Sharpton, said Paultre Bell has received &quot;hate e-mail&quot; and both she and Guzman have been tailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noerdlinger said the e-mails have been given to cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD brass declined to comment on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the president of the sergeants group denied yesterday that his staff was the source of prank calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Mullins said the taunting calls to Paultre Bell's family were made between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Friday when &quot;there were not many people in the building.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who were [in the building] are all mature professionals who wouldn't do something like that,&quot; Mullins said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE REV. AL SHARPTON vows to ratchet up the pressure on federal prosecutors today by bringing a powerful congressman to the Queens street where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot dead by city cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, will meet Bell's family this afternoon and walk from the Kalua Cabaret strip joint to the spot where Bell was killed and two friends were wounded in a fusillade of 50 shots from three detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to take him to the scene,&quot; Sharpton told a cheering crowd at his National Action Network headquarters in Harlem as Bell's father and fianc&eacute;e sat grimly nearby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to walk the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to show him how far the scene of the shooting was from the club,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows that the policeman had 50 different things he could have done in 2 1/2 blocks. If they thought that somebody was going to get a gun, he could have called for backup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congressman will first meet with Bell's family at the office of Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens), said Sharpton. A spokeswoman for Conyers did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper were acquitted of state charges Friday when Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman said they believed one of Bell's friends had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton wants federal prosecutors to charge the detectives with civil rights violations, although legal observers call that unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The justice system has let me down, let my family down, but I'm not giving up the faith,&quot; said Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell. &quot;I'm still praying for justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other civil rights leaders joined Sharpton in calling for major demonstrations in the coming weeks to protest the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You still have to hit the streets; you still have to march - you still must raise hell and go to jail,&quot; said Charles Steele of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, bringing the crowd to its feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will not be the normal stuff,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;We're going to do this in an organized, meticulous way . . . and we have support from around the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton has also threatened protests outside Cooperman's home, saying the judge looked down on Bell and his friends because they were in a seedy club late at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new way to police now is, if you think someone said they have a gun, you follow them to the gun, wait for them to get into the car and take action,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;That is why we appeal to the Justice Department to aggressively step in to protect the rights of the citizens of this city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message resonated on the streets of Harlem, where 250 protesters marched down Lenox Ave. and blocked major intersections in what may be a prelude of actions to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, Broadway - be alert,&quot; said organizer Salaam Ismial. &quot;No violent actions, but no one should be quiet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marchers chanted &quot;NYPD go to hell - we are all </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; as cops cleared traffic ahead of them and made no attempt to stop them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A half-dozen men in dark suits from the Justice Department's Community Relations Service walked quietly behind the marchers. The unit tries to defuse tense racial situations across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drivers who were stuck in traffic for about 15 minutes at 125th St. and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd. said they didn't mind the inconvenience because the civil disobedience sent an important message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It got things done in the past, so hopefully it makes a difference now,&quot; said Shawn Arana, 39, of Harlem, a father of two who was stuck in traffic. &quot;It could have been me just as easily, or it could have been [my kids].&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - A coalition of civil rights advocates Sunday urged changes in the handling of police misconduct and brutality complaints after the acquittal of three officers involved in the death of an unarmed man shot on his wedding day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called for a permanent state-level special prosecutor to investigate such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case proves it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute cases of police misconduct, especially in homicide cases,&quot; said lawyer Norman Siegel, former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three city police officers were cleared Friday in the November 2006 shooting death of Bell outside a nightclub where he had just left his bachelor party. Two friends were wounded in the volley of 50 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 illegal immigrants killed in Ariz. crash</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHOENIX - A truck jammed with as many as 60 illegal immigrants crashed and rolled in a remote part of central Arizona on Sunday, killing four and injuring many, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver and an estimated 20 to 30 passengers in the truck fled the scene and have not been located, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests have been made. Twenty-seven survivors were taken to hospitals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 400 firefighters attacked the 350-acre fire, and at least 550 residents were evacuated Saturday night and Sunday, officials said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two unmarked police cars with tinted windows were stationed outside the brick home in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plainclothes officers also kept watch from a vehicle parked in a neighbor's driveway, and a state court officer's car circled the block every few minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman has become a focal point for Bell's supporters who disagree with his verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While delivering his ruling, the judge said he did not believe the testimony of Bell's two wounded pals, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited their inconsistent statements, courtroom demeanor and rap sheets. Benefield's testimony, in particular, &quot;had the effect of eviscerating the credibility of those prosecution witnesses,&quot; Cooperman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At times, the testimony just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His words upset the Rev. Al Sharpton, Bell's parents and his fianc&eacute;e, who have pledged to organize a series of nonviolent protests around the city. On Friday, Sharpton said supporters should be willing to get themselves arrested &quot;whether it is on Wall Street, the judge's house or at 1 Police Plaza.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked yesterday about the security for the judge, Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said: &quot;We do not discuss the security arrangements for any individual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman, a married father of three, is a 74-year-old former Army lieutenant who has jailed police and criminals alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has spent nearly three years on the bench and overseen more than 500 criminal and civil trials, including 80 homicides, and has a reputation of being evenhanded. He previously served a decade in the state Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is slated for mandatory retirement at the end of next year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his acquittal, the 31-shot cop quietly prayed in an orthodox Christian church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver traveled Friday from a Queens courtroom to a Holy Week religious service in Little Falls, N.J., where he was welcomed by fellow parishioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were all praying for Mike,&quot; a parishioner said yesterday at the St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, 36, is a regular at the parish just off Route 46 in suburban Passaic County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday evening, the 13-year police veteran participated in the parish's Holy Week service; the Orthodox church marks Easter one week after Passover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and two fellow detectives were acquitted hours earlier of charges in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day after his March 2007 indictment, Oliver infuriated Bell's parents - and some of his own supporters - by enjoying a $4,200 dinner at Nello's. The tab included $180 pasta with truffles and $575 bottles of wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the New Jersey church yesterday, Father Elias Bitar said the trial was hard on Oliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the night of the Bell shooting, Oliver - who is credited with making more than 600 arrests on the job - had never fired his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's difficult for everyone involved when there's a loss of life,&quot; Bitar said yesterday. &quot;There's a sadness. You pray for everyone involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOZENS OF COPS were pulled off the streets in Brooklyn last night after NYPD officials were tipped off to a plot to shoot patrolmen, police sources said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers were taken off their foot patrols in East New York, and cop cars were positioned to block a route to the 75th Precinct stationhouse on Sutter Ave. for fear of a drive-by shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extraordinary measures were taken after a confidential informant - who works with the Brooklyn narcotics squad - told police around 6 p.m. there was a plan to shoot up the Brooklyn stationhouse, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plot also called for cops to be targeted in drive-by shootings in Brownsville and Bushwick. It was unclear if the threats were connected to the verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the three cops on trial for killing Bell in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day were acquitted of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's family and supporters, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, have denounced any violence in the name of the Bell verdict; they have vowed peaceful, nonviolent protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD brass would not comment on the threat, but a source said it was likely that it did stem from the Bell verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of violent criminals out there who are not happy that a judge sided with the police and found the cops in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case not guilty,&quot; said a police source in one of the precincts on alert. &quot;It's not a surprise that threats crop up against police after a decision like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is my son's first movie,&quot; Gojcaj said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gojcaj's voice and eyes were filled with the love and pride of a father for a son. I remembered another car, a Nissan Altima, the bullet holes and the bloodstains all too real. And I thought of another father, William Bell, whom I first saw outside Jamaica Hospital the morning of Nov. 25, 2006. Bell had just been in to see the bullet-torn body of his 23-year-old son Sean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son had been killed in a fusillade of 50 bullets plainclothes cops fired at him and two other unarmed men. Sean was to have been married that very day. The father looked as heartbroken as anyone could as he pointed at the perfect blue sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at this day,&quot; he said. &quot;It should have been a beautiful day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Bell sat with his heartbreak in the courtroom, day after day, as three of the cops were tried. Even as the prosecution's case became a tangled mess of contradictions, he seemed convinced that he would get at least a small approximation of what he considered justice. He then heard Justice Arthur Cooperman say two words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman was wrong to have cited the criminal history of one of the other victims, but he was right on the law, however unacceptable that may seem to those who see no possible justification for cops firing 50 rounds at three unarmed men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone is presumed innocent until proven otherwise, cops included, even Detective Michael Oliver, who fired two entire magazines. And the prosecution had failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the cops had not been in fear of their lives when they fired, which is all the law requires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, the acquitted three appeared at a press conference at their union headquarters, standing in front of a sign there that reads, &quot;The Greatest Detectives in the World.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York does indeed have some of the world's very finest detectives, but Oliver, in particular, is not among them. DEA President Mike Palladino is the most effective labor leader in the city, but he could have shown a bit more decorum than to exult that he spells relief &quot;n-o-t g-u-i-l-t-y!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Palladino should have announced is that the Greatest Detectives in the World would be joining the effort already underway by the Greatest Police Department in the World to prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reminder of how short a time it takes for even 50 shots to be fired came yesterday with the flurry of shots that accompanied yesterday's filming outside the Waldorf. Two riddled cabs were rolled away and two more took their place as men with paper towels blotted up a pool of red from the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're wiping off the blood, I think,&quot; Gojcaj said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gojcaj watched as the crew made ready for another take. The proud father flipped open his cell phone and showed a picture of his son, the actor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See?&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I figured William Bell must have felt much this way when his son the high school baseball star struck out 14 batters in a single game. Bell now says he wants to shut the city down. The Rev. Al Sharpton pledges to help him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a few people could create considerable chaos in the days to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If only that could bring back the son whose blood was as real as a loss that is as big as his father's love.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our city can weather the storm of civil disobedience promised by those outraged by the acquittals of the cops who slaughtered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just as we have survived other court decisions that violated basic notions of fairness and common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But weathering the storm isn't enough; we've got to come through it stronger. Here are six measures to help heal the city and make it less likely there will be another Bell killing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discipline the Cops Responsible for This Tragedy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody involved in the case, including the NYPD, has called the undercover operation at Club Kalua anything but a fumbling string of police mistakes that led to deadly force being used in a situation that yielded not a single arrest for guns, drugs or prostitution - or even a fistfight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the verdict, Justice Arthur Cooperman twice mentioned police &quot;carelessness and incompetence&quot; as issues worth addressing, albeit not in his courtroom. Using the NYPD's departmental trial system, Commissioner Raymond Kelly should move to fire, demote or reassign the officers whose lax supervision and flawed instincts cost Bell his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publish the Patrol Guide for All to Understand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents, ministers, mentors and guidance counselors citywide are at wit's end trying to figure out what to tell black boys and men about how to avoid or defuse overreactions by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of well-intentioned advice is probably irrelevant: the suggestion to follow whatever instructions come from a law-enforcement officer, for instance, can be useless when cops are conducting undercover operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD should publish the patrol guide on its Web site and work with community leaders to create a plain-English commentary that makes clear, among other things, the ways officers are supposed to identify themselves and when they are authorized to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make Breathalyzers Mandatory as a Matter of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the cops who shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman had been drinking at Kalua as part of their undercover assignment, but weren't required to prove they weren't intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly has since issued an order requiring cops to be tested in such situations in the future - but that rule could be revoked at any time by Kelly or a future commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There should be a law that cops who have been drinking on duty for any reason get tested for drunkenness if they have fired their weapons and/or killed someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Create a Special Prosecutor to Handle Police Misconduct Cases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conspiracy theorists say Queens District Attorney Richard Brown's office deliberately botched the prosecution in order to see the cops who killed Bell go free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's nonsense; the prosecutors tried really hard. But they weren't experienced in how to mount an all-out case against cops, who are their allies in 99% of all prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To cut through the built-in conflict of interest, we should have a citywide special prosecutor whose only job is to examine and prosecute allegations of police conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Address the Racial Aspects of Violent Crime and Police Brutality Forthrightly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most violent crimes in our city are committed by blacks against other blacks. And virtually all cases of cowboy craziness by cops (whatever their race) get aimed at black and Latino men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There. Was that so hard to read?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both situations are unacceptable and tear at the fabric of the city, yet political leaders run from pronouncing these hard truths and starting a public dialogue about their causes and effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will it be a difficult conversation? Of course. But real leaders don't shy away from a job just because it's hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urge Union Bosses to Act Like City Leaders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's understood that PBA President Patrick Lynch and detectives union President Michael Palladino are paid to defend their members fiercely. But many of their statements during the Bell trial denigrated the lives, lifestyles and human worth of the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That only feeds the false and poisonous idea, prevalent in black neighborhoods, that most cops hate or fear the communities they are sworn to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little restraint when it comes to &quot;dirtying up&quot; unarmed victims would go a long way - and earn union leaders respect as genuine leaders concerned about more than their next re-election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has the game, what is now the greatest game of pro football ever played, permanently saved on TiVo on one of the family television sets. It makes John Mara like a lot of Giants fans. So does this: sometimes late at night, when the house is quiet, he watches the last touchdown drive against the Patriots from Super Bowl XLII, maybe just to reassure himself all over again that it all really happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just fun to watch,&quot; Mara was saying on Friday afternoon, &quot;even though every time I watch it, I'm struck by the same thing, and that's how close the outcome was to going the other way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon the Giants will be closer to next season than last season. Even now, it is hard to imagine that nearly three months have passed since Eli Manning made those passes and David Tyree and Steve Smith and Plaxico Burress made their catches and then Tom Brady and Randy Moss couldn't make a miracle when they got the ball back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, though, we are still close enough to Giants 17, Patriots 14, close enough to Eli throwing one of only two last-minute touchdown passes to ever win an NFL title in the history of the sport. Close enough to the most amazing five-game stretch that any team around here has ever had, maybe any pro football team has ever had, the Giants being underdogs in the last five games they played last season and still managing to win it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Giants: Finally winning their last three games by beating the Cowboys in Texas as an underdog and Brett Favre at Lambeau as an underdog and then beating an 18-0 Patriots team one game away from being called the best football team of them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did all that, all the way to Glendale, Ariz., and that is why they went into yesterday's NFL draft at Radio City with the last pick of the first round, walking in there as the champions of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Mara laughed a winner's laugh about that on Friday afternoon and said, &quot;It's a hell of a lot better than drafting first. Or drafting fourth and then having to make a trade to move up.&quot; There was a pause then and Mara said, &quot;It's safe to say that draft (in 2004) was a little more stressful than this one, because I can tell you that the sentiment for making that trade (for Eli Manning) wasn't exactly unanimous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That draft&quot; and &quot;that trade.&quot; The draft when they traded up with the Chargers and gave away No. 1 draft choices and Philip Rivers for Eli Manning, the biggest roll of the dice in the history of a franchise that began with John Mara's grandfather, old Tim Mara, a legal bookmaker of the city, back in 1925.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I remember about the last 24 hours was the same question being asked over and over again,&quot; Mara said. &quot;And the question was the same one every time: Did they call yet? You had two teams, ours and theirs, trying not to look desperate and trying not to tip their hands. As I recall, we didn't even hear from them on Saturday morning. Then they were on the clock and they picked (Eli) and when they did call they said something like, 'We thought you guys were going to call.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course then came everything that happened in Eli Manning's first years with the Giants, and Ernie Accorsi, the general manager who believed in Peyton's kid brother enough to make that trade, who never wobbled or gave up on the kid even when the Giants kept going out in the first round of the playoffs, finally retired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came Super Bowl XLII in Glendale, Ariz. Super Bowl No. 42. Chuckin' Charlie Conerly's number. When John Mara's dad used to go to the racetrack and make his $2 bets, there was always a point in the day when he would bet an exacta of &quot;4&quot; and &quot;2&quot; for Conerly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Well Mara's son John sits in front of the television set at night and watches a game his father would have loved better than all of them, all the way back to 1925. Mostly he watches another Mississippi quarterback, Manning, take the Giants down the field and get away from that rush to hit Tyree and finally throw the kind of pass only Joe Montana ever threw in pro football to win it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course you see how close Asante Samuel came to intercepting that one ball on our last drive,&quot; John Mara said. &quot;And even after we scored, that first long pass that Brady threw to Moss, I still can't believe how close they came to connecting on it. But that's not the most stunning thing to me, no matter how many times I watch. The most stunning thing, every single time, is how cool Eli was during that whole drive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old fans will still say that the Colts beating the Giants in sudden death in '58 was the greatest game ever played, because it made pro football on television in this country. John Mara says he isn't old enough to say that himself, because he doesn't remember that game at Yankee Stadium all that well. No matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Super Bowl XLII is the greatest game now. Because of the kind of underdog the Giants were, because the other team was 18-0 and going for its fourth Super Bowl title. Because of the way Eli Manning took his team down the field at the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't object to you calling it that,&quot; John Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had to go back down to the draft room then, on the day before his team would have the last pick in the first round of the draft this time, wouldn't need to move up to get the first, because you don't have to when you're the champions of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes I get the idea that Tannenbaum and Mangini think they're as set with Kellen Clemens at quarterback as the Yankees are with A-Rod at third base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And wonder what they're seeing in the guy that the rest of us don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a lot of nights when the Mets have as much trouble scoring as the Jersey Devils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did I forget to share my mock draft with you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You think the NHL would rather have Sidney Crosby keep going in the Stanley Cup playoffs, or a New York team?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Presidential debates stopped being about the candidates, and getting real answers out of them, months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now they're about the guys asking the questions, acting like they're ballplayers trying to draw enough attention to themselves so they get on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes I think the Democratic voters really do think this is like &quot;American Idol&quot; and are waiting for Simon to tell them which way to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Heilman is the latest person in sports about whom we have to ask this pretty important question:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He knows these games count, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okay, everybody who thought Carlos Delgado was going to be a big bopper for the Mets this season and that Moises Alou was going to play the whole season start sending your text messages now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case seemed to have been run about as well as the New York Knicks have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been kind of neat seeing CNN morph back into the Clinton News Network during the Democratic campaign, hasn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kind of odds could you have gotten in Vegas at the start of the NBA season that the Suns and Mavericks would be out of the playoffs in the first round?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe before Steve Kerr made the trade for Shaq he should have gotten all the Suns to promise they'd cover somebody if he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are apparently under the impression in Beijing that they can make the smog disappear the way Peter Ueberroth made traffic in L.A. disappear in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have to be nights at Dodger Stadium when Joe Torre misses A-Rod and Jeter the way kids at camp miss their puppies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did anybody except me notice that what Hank Steinbrenner said to the Times on Sunday night bore absolutely no relation to what he said to everybody else on Monday?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a fun fact of the baseball season:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though he still isn't close to getting his batting average over the Mendoza Line of .200, David Ortiz has more RBI so far than A-Rod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Hiaasen's new book, &quot;The Downhill Lie,&quot; about his return to golf after more than 30 years, is one of the funniest golf books ever written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time Hillary Clinton says that you have a choice when it comes to picking a pastor, don't you want to say, &quot;What about husbands?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I always worry that starting on Wednesday guys are going to start analyzing next year's NFL draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sort of know enough about Eliot Spitzer's bedside manner now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, though, we are still close enough to Giants 17, Patriots 14, close enough to Eli throwing one of only two last-minute touchdown passes to ever win an NFL title in the history of the sport. Close enough to the most amazing 5-game stretch that any team around here has ever had, maybe any pro football team has ever had, the Giants being underdogs in the last five games they played last season and still managing to win it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Giants: Finally winning their last three games by beating the Cowboys in Texas as an underdog and Brett Favre in Lambeau as an underdog and then beating an 18-0 Patriots team one game away from being called the best football team of them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did all that, all the way to Glendale, Ariz., and that is why they went into yesterday's NFL draft at Radio City with the last pick of the first round, walking in there as the champions of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Mara laughed a winner's laugh about that on Friday afternoon and said, &quot;It's a hell of a lot better than drafting first. Or drafting fourth and then having to make a trade to move up.&quot; There was a pause then and Mara said, &quot;It's safe to say that draft (in 2004) was a little more stressful than this one, because I can tell you that the sentiment for making that trade (for Eli Manning) wasn't exactly unanimous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That draft&quot; and &quot;that trade.&quot; The draft when they traded up with the Chargers and gave away No. 1 draft choices and Philip Rivers for Eli Manning, the biggest roll of the dice in the history of a franchise that began with John Mara's grandfather, old Tim Mara, a legal bookmaker of the city, back in 1925.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I remember about the last 24 hours was the same question being asked over and over again,&quot; Mara said. &quot;And the question was the same one every time: Did they call yet? You had two teams, ours and theirs, trying not to look desperate and trying not to tip their hands. As I recall, we didn't even hear from them on Saturday morning. Then they were on the clock and they picked (Eli) and when they did call they said something like, 'We thought you guys were going to call.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course then came everything that happened in Eli Manning's first years with the Giants, and Ernie Accorsi, the general manager who believed in Peyton's kid brother enough to make that trade, who never wobbled or gave up on the kid even when the Giants kept going out in the first round of the playoffs, finally retired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came Super Bowl XLII in Glendale, Ariz. Super Bowl No. 42. Chuckin' Charlie Conerly's number. When John Mara's dad used to go to the racetrack and make his $2 bets, there was always a point in the day when he would bet an exacta of &quot;4&quot; and &quot;2&quot; for Conerly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Well Mara's son John sits in front of the television set at night and watches a game his father would have loved better than all of them, all the way back to 1925. Mostly he watches another Mississippi quarterback, Manning, take the Giants down the field and get away from that rush to hit Tyree and finally throw the kind of pass only Joe Montana ever threw in pro football to win it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course you see how close Asante Samuels came to intercepting that one ball on our last drive,&quot; John Mara said. &quot;And even after we scored, that first long pass that Brady threw to (Randy) Moss, I still can't believe how close they came to connecting on it. But that's not the most stunning thing to me, no matter how many times I watch. The most stunning thing, every single time, is how cool Eli was during that whole drive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old fans will still say that the Colts beating the Giants in sudden death in '58 was the greatest game ever played, because it made pro football on television in this country. John Mara says he isn't old enough to say that himself, because he doesn't remember that game at Yankee Stadium all that well. No matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Super Bowl XLII is the greatest game now. Because of the kind of underdog the Giants were, because the other team was 18-0 and going for its fourth Super Bowl. Because of the way Eli Manning took his team down the field at the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't object to you calling it that,&quot; John Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had to go back down to the draft room then, on the day before his team would have the last pick in the first round of the draft this time, wouldn't need to move up to get the first, because you don't have to when you're the champions of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes I get the idea that Tannenbaum and Mangini think they're as set with Kellen Clemens at quarterback as the Yankees are with A-Rod at third base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And wonder what they're seeing in the guy that the rest of us don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a lot of nights when the Mets have as much trouble scoring as the Jersey Devils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did I forget to share my mock draft with you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You think the NHL would rather have Sidney Crosby keep going in the Stanley Cup playoffs, or a New York team?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Presidential debates stopped being about the candidates, and getting real answers out of them, months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now they're about the guys asking the questions, acting like they're ballplayers trying to draw enough attention to themselves so they get on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes I think the Democratic voters really do think this is like &quot;American Idol&quot; and are waiting for Simon to tell them which way to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Heilman is the latest person in sports about whom we have to ask this pretty important question:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He knows these games count, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okay, everybody who thought Carlos Delgado was going to be a big bopper for the Mets this season and that Moises Alou was going to play the whole season start sending your text messages now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case seemed to have been run about as well as the New York Knicks have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been kind of neat seeing CNN morph back into the Clinton News Network during the Democratic campaign, hasn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kind of odds could you have gotten in Vegas at the start of the NBA season that the Suns and Mavericks would be out of the playoffs in the first round?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe before Steve Kerr made the trade for Shaq he should have gotten all the Suns to promise they'd cover somebody if he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are apparently under the impression in Beijing that they can make the smog disappear the way Peter Ueberroth made traffic in L.A. disappear in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have to be nights at Dodger Stadium when Joe Torre misses A-Rod and Jeter the way kids at camp miss their puppies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did anybody except me notice that what Hank Steinbrenner said to the Times on Sunday night bore absolutely no relation to what he said to everybody else on Monday?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a fun fact of the baseball season:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though he still isn't close to getting his batting average over the Mendoza Line of .200, David Ortiz has more RBI so far than A-Rod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Hiaasen's new book, &quot;The Downhill Lie,&quot; about his return to golf after more than 30 years, is one of the funniest golf books ever written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time Hillary Clinton says that you have a choice when it comes to picking a pastor, don't you want to say, &quot;What about husbands?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I always worry that starting on Wednesday guys are going to start analyzing next year's NFL draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sort of know enough about Eliot Spitzer's bedside manner now.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NICOLE PAULTRE BELL, teary-eyed but tenacious, vowed yesterday to champion demonstrations around the city over the acquittal of three cops in her fianc&eacute;'s 50-shot slaying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every march, every rally, I'm going to be right up front,&quot; Paultre Bell said, breaking her silence for the first time since the cops were cleared Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The justice system let me down,&quot; Paultre Bell said, her voice strong, her message clear. &quot;They killed Sean all over again. That's what it felt like to us.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her commitment echoed a vow made a day earlier by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> father. At his son's graveside shortly after the verdict was read, William Bell gave his consent &quot;to shut this city down&quot; through a series of nonviolent protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who introduced Paultre Bell at yesterday's rally, said a massive citywide demonstration would occur within the next two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three NYPD detectives were cleared of all charges in the 50-shot barrage that killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a 23-year-old father of two, on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've shown they will not hold the police responsible,&quot; Sharpton said yesterday in a fiery address from his Harlem headquarters. &quot;Well guess what? If you won't, we will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre Bell wore an all-black mourning outfit, with a button bearing the face of her slain fianc&eacute;. Sharpton, in similarly somber clothes, stressed that the demonstrations - which he called a &quot;freedom brigade&quot; - would be peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone who can't control themselves can't be a part of this movement,&quot; Sharpton said, urging those incensed by the ruling to sign up at his National Action Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd, gathered at the headquarters to hear Paultre Bell speak, responded to the call for demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shut it down! Shut it down!&quot; they chanted. Many in the crowd then launched an impromptu protest march along Lenox Ave. - perhaps a small harbinger of Sharpton's grand plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton provided no specifics for the protest, but quoted Martin Luther King's call for &quot;massive civil disobedience&quot; as an agent for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said more details would emerge during a Tuesday meeting in Manhattan. The intent of the protests, Sharpton said, was to make the city &quot;stand still and realize you do not have the right to shoot down unarmed individuals without probable cause.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton added that civil rights leaders from around the nation will be in New York today to press for federal civil rights charges against acquitted Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre Bell was expected to visit Washington tomorrow as part of that effort, which several legal experts have described as an uphill battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, Isnora and Cooper have remained mostly in seclusion. Oliver went to Mass in New Jersey late Friday and Cooper emerged briefly yesterday from his suburban Middletown home to mow the lawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now I can't make any comment,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;I'm being advised [by] my attorneys. I would love to talk with you, but I can't at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper - the only one of the acquitted cops to offer an apology to the Bell family - added he was hoping for some privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbors praised the 18-year police veteran as kind and helpful, a great husband and father. His next-door neighbor said she was certain Cooper's &quot;I'm sorry&quot; after the acquittal was heartfelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know he means it,&quot; said the neighbor, who gave her name only as Millie. &quot;I know the kind of person he is, and he means well. I know that [the Cooper family has] been tormented by this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton took particular aim yesterday at Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, who handed down Friday's verdict in the emotionally charged case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He threatened demonstrations outside Cooperman's home, and promised to investigate the veteran jurist's background. Sharpton was particularly incensed by Cooperman's remarks about the criminal past and courtroom demeanor of prosecution witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These factors played a significant part in the people's ability to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and had the effect of eviscerating [their] credibility,&quot; Cooperman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge was referring to two star prosecution witnesses, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, the survivors of the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting. Both had rap sheets before the violence, which occurred outside the Kalua Cabaret in the aftermath of Bell's bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Guzman was particularly combative on the witness stand while testifying, at one point announcing he has no respect for any of the defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, calling the judge's remarks &quot;an insult,&quot; said &quot;there's nowhere else in this city where demeanor and background are a factor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman joined Sharpton and Bell yesterday, expressing his pain at the verdict and support for the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman, in rendering his decision, considered a pair of competing scenarios: The undercover officers were reckless and overreacted when they opened fire, or the victims were intoxicated hoodlums who instigated the episode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said the reaction to the much-anticipated verdict was quiet across the city yesterday. He said he expected the protests to be peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vigils and demonstrations related to the Bell case to date have not been violent,&quot; he said. &quot;We have no reason to expect otherwise now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver, Marc Cooper and Gescard Isnora are still vulnerable to federal charges, disciplinary action from the NYPD and civil suits. </SPAN></P>

Sharpton yesterday called the criminal acquittal a &quot;comma&quot; in the story of Bell. &quot;We are going to bring the period and the exclamation point,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a look at several other notorious cases involving city cops and their divergent outcomes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANTHONY BAEZ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Francis Livoti placed Baez, who was asthmatic, in a fatal choke hold in 1994 after a football tossed by the 29-year-old hit the cop's police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Livoti was charged with criminally negligent homicide, but was acquitted at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal charges</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued by the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York said the feds &quot;have been monitoring the state's prosecution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feds promised to &quot;take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feds rarely charge cops with civil rights violations - and almost never act in cases where the officers have been acquitted in state court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's very unlikely&quot; any new charges will be brought, said Anthony Ricco, the lawyer for cleared Detective Gescard Isnora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecuting cops under federal civil rights statutes can be hard because authorities must prove the officers intended to deprive a victim of his or her civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syracuse University report found that federal prosecutors declined to file charges against virtually all - 98.7% - cases of alleged civil rights violations by officials, but it happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, NYPD Officer Francis Livoti was acquitted in the Bronx of charges that he killed a man with a choke hold. Federal prosecutors then indicted him on civil rights charges. He was convicted in 1998 and served six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feds have asked the NYPD to delay departmental proceedings until they decide whether to pursue the case against the three cops cleared of criminal charges yesterday. Once it gets the go-ahead, the NYPD will have 18 months to probe whether the cops violated department rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops are on modified duty, stripped of their guns. NYPD insiders say it's unlikely they'll ever patrol the streets again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW IT was time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After eight grueling weeks, more than 50 prosecution witnesses, blistering courtroom confrontations and radioactive racial tension crackling in the courtroom and hallways, Judge Arthur Cooperman enters the courtroom in his usual unceremonious way, insisting that no one stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He takes his seat on the bench. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he calls for one final sidebar with the lawyers, who assemble on the steps to Cooperman's bench like disciples at the Sermon on the Mount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this instant, in this windowless, oaken realm of jurisprudence, in a nonjury trial, Cooperman is indeed godlike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He holds in his 74-year-old hands alone the fate of three young police officers faced with manslaughter and reckless endangerment, two of them facing 25 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tension percolates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the defense table, the three cops are fidgety, coiled, like jacks in this courtroom box that is ringed with 18 no-nonsense court officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores more line the hallways; others secure the front and back entrances. Police helicopters circle the baby blue skies over Kew Gardens. Cops clog Queens Blvd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city waits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the center stage of New York City, and here in the courtroom these three police officers will momentarily learn their fate when the judge delivers his verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very word verdict falls from the lips like a marble tablet. Official, final, heavy with joy or doom. A word derived from the Latin verum dictum, or true word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the granite-faced lawyers return to their respective tables. The tension resembles that anxious nanosecond before the timekeeper hammers the opening bell of a heavyweight championship fight. Only this is a thousand times more dramatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Cooperman begins to read his true word in a precise, professional, unemotional tone appropriate for the tragedy in which an unarmed man was killed and two others wounded in a lead storm of 50 police bullets in the shadow of a poultry slaughterhouse on a miserable side street in South Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge never loses sight of the human loss at the core of the case, which is also a hole in the soul of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tone is stentorian, but Cooperman is not verbose. In about a dozen minutes, he quickly determines that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a confrontation about a gun in front of Kalua Cabaret on Nov. 25, 2006, and an undercover cop followed Bell, Guzman and Benefield around the corner. The undercover ordered them to freeze. Instead, Bell slammed his car into him, backed up and raced forward again, hitting a police van. Then the shooting started, but it was not unlawful or excessive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman also determines there were too many inconsistencies from the prosecution witnesses, especially Trent Benefield and Joe Guzman. Therefore, he says, the prosecution's case simply does not establish proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman then utters the words: &quot;NOT GUILTY.&quot; Clank, clank, like hammer hitting chisel, forever etching the words into the history book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A warble rises in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court officers methodically usher out the press, then the police supporters, then the Bell supporters, avoiding confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out on sun-splashed Queens Blvd., birds chirp in budding trees, helicopters hover in the blue sky and people express outrage over the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young girl carries a sign: PEOPLE'S JUSTICE: PIGS ARE GUILTY AS HELL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police break up a brief scuffle, but there are no major confrontations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could it finally be over?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first e-mail after the verdict is from a black man named Stephen Bellinger from South Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What faith can a person have in a justice system that can see no wrongdoing with this incident?&quot; he asks. &quot;Yeah, everyone will say the DA's office dropped the ball, but I believe they played their part very well. And I'm telling you as sure as the sky is blue, and that the sun is out today, within two years, this will happen again!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope his is not also a true word.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER 17 MONTHS of silence, the three cops in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case spoke publicly for the first time yesterday - but only one of them apologized to the victim's family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His voice cracking slightly, an emotional Detective Marc Cooper began a brief, halting statement with an act of contrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; said Cooper, who fired four bullets in the 50-shot barrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, like co-defendants Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora, who spoke before him, Cooper, 40, thanked those who stood by him after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to thank the Lord, my savior, for today,&quot; he added, appearing on the verge of tears. &quot;This started my life back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora, 29, and Oliver, 36, praised Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman for his acquittal of the trio on all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First and foremost, I'd like to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for bringing this all to fruition,&quot; said Isnora, who fired 11 shots outside the Kalua Cabaret strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secondly for the honorable Judge Cooperman for his fair and accurate decision today, and lastly for my family and friends for their support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who has been the focus of outrage because he fired 31 shots, thanked Cooperman &quot;for making a fair and just decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His relatives gathered at a home in Clifton, N.J., where one gleefully told a neighbor, &quot;He's been cleared on all counts!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our prayers have been answered,&quot; a cousin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and his fellow detectives didn't take questions at the press conference organized by the Detectives' Endowment Association, or discuss specifics of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was left to DEA President Michael Palladino, who analyzed the evidence, ripped Bell's two friends who were wounded in the shooting, and piled scorn on the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do I spell relief? N-O-T G-U-I-L-T-Y,&quot; Palladino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our sympathies go out to the Bell family,&quot; he said. &quot;We have been portrayed as insensitive murderers and I can tell you that we are not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino displayed no sympathy for Bell's pals Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, both of whom testified against the detectives. Palladino cited Benefield's shifting account of the shooting as the &quot;turning point&quot; in the trial, accusing him of lying to bolster a civil suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He transformed from a victim into a businessman,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives also were helped by Guzman's performance on the stand, Palladino said. &quot;He was arrogant. He was belligerent. And he was combative,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they've escaped state prison sentences, the cops' futures are cloudy. They face a possible federal civil rights investigation, a civil suit and an NYPD probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, Cooper and Isnora are on modified duty, stripped of their guns. Sources say it's unlikely they'll ever patrol the streets again, and the stain of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case may stay with them for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Isnora's Bushwick neighborhood, some residents were angry he wasn't convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should put 'Murderer' on his door,&quot; said Pablo Rios, 41.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NIGHTMARE that began on Nicole Paultre Bell's wedding day spawned more heartache yesterday as she fled court in tears, knelt at her fianc&eacute;'s grave and returned home to taunting phone calls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clad in black, the young mother of two did not put her emotions into words, but her family said she was crushed that no one would pay for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anybody would be devastated,&quot; her father, Les Paultre, said outside his Far Rockaway home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre Bell, 23, began the day with a tearful prayer with the Rev. Al Sharpton at a diner near the courthouse in Kew Gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They walked into the courtroom together, but when Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman announced the not guilty verdict, she broke away and ran out in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was soon followed by Trent Benefield, who was with Bell at the Kalua Cabaret and was wounded in the hail of gunfire that killed his buddy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tears streamed down Benefield's face as he spoke with disgust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They did a crime, they should pay the price. It's unfair,&quot; he said. &quot;If I did it, I'd be doing 25 to life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield, 24, said he planned to &quot;keep fighting&quot; for justice for his friend and said he was sure the acquitted cops would face a day of reckoning at some point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the end, they have to deal with God, like all of us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy security enveloped Bell's parents, Valerie and William, as they left the courthouse with their slain son's fianc&eacute;e.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They headed for the Nassau Knolls Cemetery &amp; Memorial Park in Port Washington, L.I., where Bell's grave is marked with a simple granite slab bearing the epitaph &quot;See you later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeping, Nicole knelt on the ground and placed flowers next to the marker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, she returned to her parents' home, where police were called to investigate a series of callous, crank calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole's father said when they answered the phone, they heard laughing or the line went dead. The number on the caller ID came back to the Sergeants Benevolent Association, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SBA President Edward Mullins said the NYPD was investigating the phone calls. &quot;We'll cooperate with any investigation. If . . . it came from here, I want to know,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Les Paultre said he was stunned by the verdict. He called it &quot;ridiculous,&quot; but said the family was not discouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to give up,&quot; he said. &quot;We're going to keep pushing forward because Sean did not die in vain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's parents echoed that message. After returning from the cemetery, they locked arms with 10 supporters, some in T-shirts with Bell's picture on the front and the slogan &quot;Never Again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today I felt like I was reliving the death of my son all over again,&quot; Valerie Bell said. &quot;We are going to fight this to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though their anger was palpable, the Bells were calm and urged supporters to follow suit. The message was mostly heeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, family friend Lloyd Nelson yelled: &quot;This is as calm as we are going to be! If Nicole and the parents had not asked us to be calm, we'd be burning the city now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUEENS DISTRICT attorney defended his office's handling of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial yesterday, despite a lackluster assessment by the judge who cleared the police of all charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did our job,&quot; District Attorney Richard Brown said at a press conference following the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court has now spoken, and it's now up to us to do everything in our power to make certain that we learn from that which occurred and to do whatever we can to make certain that it never occurs again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's office endured stiff criticism from some in the victim's family early in the case for failing to prosecute aggressively enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lead prosecutor Charles Testagrossa, standing at Brown's right hand, defended his team's case, calling the Bell trial &quot;the most difficult case I've ever had to try&quot; in his 31 years on the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You try a case like this, you're going to become a lightning rod for criticism. This is not an easy road,&quot; Testagrossa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice is supposed to be for everybody, that includes people that have had phony convictions, or arrests, and it includes police officers as well. This is what we had to do, and we did it as best we could.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the loss, Testagrossa and Brown praised Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I accept his verdict and I urge that all fair-minded people do the same,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman said prosecutors failed to meet their burden of proof, in part because of failures among their witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, Cooperman attacked the &quot;criminal convictions&quot; and &quot;the demeanor&quot; of some witnesses, in an apparent reference to the hostile testimony of Joseph Guzman on the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testagrossa defended Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought he was appropriately angry,&quot; Testagrossa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said he discussed the case with the U.S. Attorney's office and offered his cooperation should they decide to press a civil rights case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These defendants and the others that were involved still have a number of hurdles to cross before someone says they were fully exonerated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUSTICE ARTHUR Cooperman's not-guilty verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killing was a disaster for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a disaster that leaves a large swath of the population with the sense that the odds are rigged against them, the cops are out of control, and the courts are no place to look for justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't have to be that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting in the front row of the courtroom as the verdict was read, I was amazed at how Cooperman gave the case a narrow reading that mentioned the flaws and inconsistencies of the prosecution case, but ignored the gaping holes in the defense version of what happened outside the Kalua that fateful night in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives' defense depended on the notion that they identified themselves as officers, ordered Bell and his companions to surrender, and reacted when Bell tried to drive away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the lieutenant in charge of the operation testified that he never heard his companions ID themselves, and the first outside officers to arrive on the scene testified that they didn't see the detectives wearing badges. Cooperman gave no indication the inconsistencies mattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman also skipped any mention of whether the level of deadly force applied - dozens of shots fired at unarmed men who committed no crime - made any difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If all three officers on trial had done what Detective Michael Oliver did - empty their clips, reload and fire again - nearly 100 bullets would have flown. Would that be considered reckless?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pray we never have to find out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next act in this drama will be a series of demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. They will be designed to make the whole city feel the deep unease and smoldering anger now felt by the Bell family and its supporters in the civil rights community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not an idle threat. Twenty years ago, in demonstrations called Days of Outrage, Sharpton and a surprisingly small band of nonviolent protesters shut down the Brooklyn Bridge and brought the subway system to a standstill simply by jumping down on the tracks at strategically-selected stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A repeat of that campaign - call them the Cooperman Campaign - would horribly inconvenience Gotham and draw national attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also illustrate what George Orwell called &quot;the moral dilemma that is presented to the weak in a world governed by the strong: Break the rules, or perish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People should not have to paralyze the city to make everyone see that police actions in the Bell case - whether viewed as a crime or horrible blunder - cannot be excused as &quot;just one of those things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THIS CASE, they must.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have not heard Mayor Bloomberg, Commissioner Raymond Kelly or anyone else lay out a clear, convincing, detailed plan for ensuring there will be no more situations in which undercover officers rush up on unarmed, innocent people and unleash deadly force as if they're in a war zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton and other protesters should nonviolently raise hell until we do. Protest in the face of unacceptable conditions is as patriotic as singing the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; on the Fourth of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while many will heap scorn and gleeful contempt on demonstrators, the protesters should do what any patriot would if someone tries to drown them out during the national anthem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops quickly contained the first firestorm after the three cops who killed Bell were acquitted, but many New Yorkers - especially African-Americans - were still seething.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Nicole and the parents had not asked us to be calm, we'd be burning the city now,&quot; said protester Lloyd Nelson, referring to Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, and the slain man's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is as calm as we are going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be my son tomorrow!&quot; chimed in a woman who identified herself as Cynthia, one of the dozens wearing Bell's face on hats, T-shirts and buttons. &quot;That judge is more guilty than the officers who shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorrow and sadness were widespread across Bell's neighborhood in Jamaica - and was clearly visible in the red-rimmed eyes of Bell's pastor, Lester Williams, who had led a march to the courthouse steps before the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We accept the verdict, but this is not the end,&quot; Williams said. &quot;I have never seen an injustice like this before. Fifty shots and no one is being held responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was killed on Nov. 25, 2006, on what would have been his wedding day. He was sitting in his car with two buddies around the corner from Kalua Cabaret, a strip joint where he had his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 300 protesters chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; marched last night from the courthouse to the spot where Bell was killed. The club shut its doors for the night &quot;out of respect for the community,&quot; a man inside said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New York City needs to be outraged,&quot; said demonstrator Jesse Ehrensaft, 31, a social worker from Jackson Heights. &quot;People do not agree justice was served. Fifty shots is clearly murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the color line, many white New Yorkers expressed sympathy for the Bell family but many gave the detectives the benefit of the doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I'd been on the jury, I wouldn't have known what to believe,&quot; said Steffan Aletti, who lives in midtown. &quot;There was too much conflict and confusion in the witnesses testimony. . . . I think the acquittal was warranted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joan Boyle, who lives in Tudor City, said, &quot;We should respect the verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope there's not an effort to denigrate the system, even though you may disagree with the verdict,&quot; she said. &quot;I try to put myself in the place of those cops who are there night after night after night outside a well-known drug and strip joint.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bitter as the verdict was to many New Yorkers, the acquittal of three NYPD detectives in the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a fair exercise in the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman drew on evidence adduced at the eight-week trial to render his not-guilty verdict in favor of Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was enough in the record to support sparing the cops criminal responsibility for Bell's death in a 50-shot barrage. But the officers must still be held to account for grievous failures in judgment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proceedings must begin to dismiss Oliver, Isnora and Cooper from the NYPD, along with the supervisors who let the detectives' undercover operation run amok with fatal consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial proved to be a clarifying, maddening, heartbreaking exposition of the events on the night that Bell died and two of his friends were wounded. As laid out skillfully by the Queens district attorney, the story is, at its core, a tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, went to a strip club for an impromptu bachelor party the night before his wedding. The cops were undercover in the club as part of a drive against quality-of-life offenses, such as prostitution and drug sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one set out to commit a crime that night. No one set out to shoot anyone. But then the cops picked up signs that someone in the club was armed with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, according to testimony, there was a confrontation between Bell's group and a man on the street who gave the impression he had a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, according to testimony, one of Bell's friends said he was going to get a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Bell's group walked around the corner to his car. The cops followed. Possibly believing he faced attack by a dangerous civilian, Bell attempted to drive away. The car struck Isnora. Isnora opened fire, followed by Oliver, Cooper and other cops who weren't indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are permitted to shoot when they reasonably believe their lives are in danger. Under the law, the DA had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Oliver, Isnora and Cooper had no good cause to believe they were mortally threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a very high standard for a prosecutor to meet - and an impossible one here because the cops had heard talk of an illegal gun. That the talk was wrong only deepens the pain inflicted on Bell's fianc&eacute;e and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, too, the facts that Isnora fired 11 shots and Oliver let loose 31 times, stopping to reload. But it was all over, Cooperman concluded, in &quot;just seconds.&quot; He declined to judge the cops criminally reckless for unleashing the fusillade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the closest of calls. Another judge, or perhaps a jury, might have found otherwise. Just as other cops might have had more control, might have been more aware that Bell and his friends could respond to them as attackers, might have approached with lights and sirens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what others might have done is not the point in a manslaughter trial. As Cooperman said, simple incompetence is not criminal even when deadly. It is, however, grounds for getting the boot. Which is why Oliver, Isnora and Cooper must go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They killed an unarmed man. They brought irreparable loss to his family. They tore the social fabric. They damaged race relations, regardless of the fact that one is black, one half-black and one Hispanic. And they cast the NYPD into the worst possible light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is anger now. It is understandable, and it will be voiced in protest. Let it be heard in the hope, as expressed by Mayor Bloomberg and Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, that such a debacle in which there are only losers never happens again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blew out everything yesterday morning for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict, then almost audibly held their breath while waiting to see if the blanket acquittals would trigger an explosive aftermath. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their sigh of relief at the largely orderly response among Bell supporters stood in sharp contrast to the tone at black radio stations, where many hosts and callers immediately expressed frustration and fury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't go tearing your neighborhood up,&quot; said Ed Lover, morning host on WWPR (105.1 FM). &quot;But I'm so mad I don't know what to do. This is a travesty of justice. It's like black life in New York don't matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These families wanted some justice,&quot; said Bob Slade, news director of WRKS (98.7 FM). &quot;They didn't get any.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WBLS (107.5 FM) morning host Steve Harvey said, &quot;We're sick and tired. This country needs to be repaired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a caller to WQHT (97.1 FM) talked about &quot;channeling our anger to something positive,&quot; morning host Miss Jones said, &quot;Maybe this isn't the time to suppress our anger,&quot; though she added that she wasn't advocating violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With neither the acquitted officers nor the families of victims making public statements (even the Rev. Al Sharpton held off), television's coverage after the verdict felt muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the local stations sent reporters to the scene, but often stayed with crowd shots from helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters assessed the verdict with analysts, who generally agreed that the prosecution was not able to make a case that was convincing enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosts on talk-radio WABC (770 AM) were more sympathetic toward the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his homeboys were doing, they didn't deserve to die,&quot; said WABC's Curtis Sliwa. &quot;But anyone who thinks a police officer goes into any situation looking to pull his gun and shoot somebody is insane.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 25, 2006 - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed on his wedding day and his two buddies, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were badly wounded when undercover cops fired 50 shots at Bell's car. None of the three was armed. It happened around the corner from the seedy Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens, where Bell had his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 26, 2006 - Five cops involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave and told to give up their guns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 27, 2006 - Mayor Bloomberg denounced the shooting and said 50 shots &quot;sounds like excessive force.&quot; Detective Michael Oliver was identified as the shooter of 31 shots. Another officer, Michael Carey, fired three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 28, 2006 - A lawyer for one of the accused cops, Gescard Isnora, told the Daily News he identified himself as a cop before firing 11 times at Bell's car. Isnora said he thought Guzman was going for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 29, 2006 - Speaking for the first time since the shooting, Guzman insisted cops &quot;tried to kill me.&quot; Meanwhile, cop sources claimed there was a fourth man by Bell's car who may have run off with a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 30, 2006 - Police launch raids in Queens that fail to find the so-called fourth man, angering Jamaica residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dec. 1, 2006 - At Bell's wrenching funeral, Sharpton told Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott, &quot;I don't believe the fourth guy exists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dec. 9, 2006 - The Daily News reported that Bell's fiancee legally changed her name to Nicole Paultre Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dec. 14, 2006 - The alleged fourth man, Jean Nelson, told The News' Juan Gonzalez he saw another man with a gun run past him toward Bell's car. &quot;The man with the gun never yelled, 'Police,'&quot; before he started shooting, Nelson said. That man was Isnora, who fired 11 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 16, 2007 - Oliver and Isnora were hit with manslaughter, felony assault and reckless endangerment charges. Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four times, was charged with reckless endangerment. Two other cops - Detective Paul Headley and Officer Carey - were cleared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sept. 26, 2007 - Benefield arrested after cops saw him strike his girlfriend, Nyla Page-Walthrus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 23, 2008 - A state appeals court refused the cops' request to move the trial out of Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan. 24, 2008 - The accused cops waived a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feb. 25, 2008 - The 50-shot trial got underway with prosecutors portraying Bell as the victim of trigger-happy cops and the defense attacking him as a provocative &quot;drunk&quot; who brought tragedy on himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feb. 29, 2008 - Lt. Gary Napoli, the commanding officer of the accused detectives, said he didn't hear the undercover cops yell &quot;Police!&quot; or see any badges displayed before the shooting because he was reaching under the dashboard of his car to fetch a portable police light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 6, 2008 - Napoli's claims were undermined by a NYPD crime scene investigator who said he found no such light inside or outside Napoli's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 19, 2008 - Fabio Coicou, the mysterious &quot;man in black&quot; who argued with Bell outside the club testified that none of Bell's pals threatened him with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 20, 2008 - Isnora, in grand jury testimony read at trial, insisted he screamed &quot;Police, don't move! Police, don't move!&quot; before he fired. He said Guzman appeared to be reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24, 2008 - Oliver, also in grand jury testimony read at trial, insisted he identified himself before shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 31, 2008 - Benefield testified he didn't know the men shooting at him were cops. Defense lawyers called him an opportunist who tailored his testimony with an eye on winning a $50 million civil suit against the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 1, 2008 - In angry testimony, Guzman insisted he never threatened anyone with a gun and became enraged when the defense accused him of lying. He said a dying Bell told him &quot;I love you&quot; despite earlier testimony by a medical examiner who said the shots destroyed Bell's vocal chords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 3, 2008 - Officer Carey claimed they warned the victims they were cops before firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 10, 2008 - Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman denies a defense motion to drop all the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 14, 2008 - Cooperman began deliberating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 25, 2008 - All three cops are acquitted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling the Bell verdict &quot;an abortion of justice,&quot; Sharpton later vowed to hit New Yorkers &quot;in the pocketbook&quot; and said he was looking for volunteers ready to &quot;go to jail&quot; if necessary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They expect us to react in traditional ways; they will not get that,&quot; he said on his radio show in Harlem. &quot;We are going to engage in economic withdrawal. We are going to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 blocks away in lower Manhattan, Michael Palladino, the president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, praised the verdict while Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper spoke publicly for the first time since the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper apologized to the Bell family &quot;for the tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Justice Department said it would review the case to see if Bell's civil rights were violated when he was killed on his wedding day. The three cops remain on modified duty and have surrendered their guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Weeping shooting survivor Trent Benefield called the verdict &quot;unfair&quot; and vowed to keep fighting. &quot;They should have gotten what they deserve. If I did it, I'd be doing 25 to life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mayor Bloomberg, who took a lot of heat from cop groups for saying the shooting appeared to be &quot;excessive,&quot; said, &quot;There are no winners and losers in a trial like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who mobilized hundreds of extra cops in case there was trouble yesterday, appealed for calm. &quot;Some people were disappointed with the verdict and we understand that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tears of rage and joy flowed in the Queens courtroom after Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman read his verdict a little after 9 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, ran crying out of the courtroon while Benefield broke down in tears. William and Valerie Bell, Sean's parents, sat in stunned silence while Bell supporters swore under their breaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the tense courtroom, Oliver appeared to be weeping with relief as he and the other acquitted detectives were hustled out through a back door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Queens Supreme Court, small scuffles broke out after Bell supporters walked out, some of them yelling, &quot;Murderers! Murderers!&quot; and &quot;KKK!&quot; The hundreds of police officers standing watch quickly intervened and there were no other outbursts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, was sitting in his car with two pals, Benefield and Joseph Guzman, when he was killed. They had just been at the Kalua Cabaret, a strip joint in Jamaica, Queens, for Bell's bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora, Cooper and Oliver were carrying out an undercover sting operation at the club. When the shooting was over, Bell was dead and Benefield and Guzmanwere badly wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reaching his verdict, Cooperman had to consider two simple-yet-competing arguments - either the police were reckless and overreacted or the victims were acting like drunken thugs and brought it on themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers said the detectives fired on Bell's car in self-defense because they believed Guzman was reaching for a gun. No gun was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman said the prosecution's case was undermined by &quot;prior inconsistent statements.&quot; He said he didn't believe their star witnesses - Benefield and Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield's testimony, in particular, &quot;eviscerated the credibility of those prosecution witnesses,&quot; the judge said. &quot;At times, the testimony just didn't make sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before wrapping up its case, the defense played a tape of Benefield right after the shooting in which he said a man - who never identified himself as a detective - suddenly fired on Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors were perplexed at the time, but the defense insisted the tape contradicted what Benefield said in court, and the judge agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His credibility was seriously impeached,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman said Guzman's angry turn on the stand hurt the prosecution's case. He also was swayed by defense arguments that the survivors might have tailored their testimony to win a $50 million civil suit against the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that Bell, Benefield and Guzman all had criminal records, Cooperman questioned why they chose for Bell's bachelor party a strip club &quot;known as venues that create criminal activity . . . such as prostitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman insisted the court &quot;did not view the victims or the NYPD as having been on trial here,&quot; but &quot;the burden was on the people to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justification was used as a defense, so Cooperman said he had to consider the &quot;mindset of the defendants, not the victims. What the victims did was more important to resolve the issues at hand than what was in their minds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman said he believed cops' claims that Guzman threatened to fetch a gun after Bell got into a squabble with a stranger outside the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The confrontation that took place in front of the club was heated,&quot; the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court finds another threat was made by Joseph Guzman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman was silent on what many considered a key issue in the case - whether the undercover cops identified themselves before they opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The incident lasted just seconds,&quot; the judge said. Despite &quot;the unfortunate circumstances of their conduct, the actions of the defendants was not proved to be criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman delivered his verdict in a stern voice, interrupting his monologue only once when Benefield's baby began crying in court. &quot;I'm not going to continue unless the child is removed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield's girlfriend, Nyla Page Walthrus, quickly walked out with the 16-month-old boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman's verdict closed the book on a closely watched eight-week trial during which NYPD procedures were put under the microscope and the reputations of Bell and his wounded buddies were dragged through the mud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who fired 31 times and reloaded once, and Isnora, who fired 11 times, had been charged with manslaughter, felony assault and reckless endangerment. They faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted on all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, who fired four times, faced up to a year in jail if convicted of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the detectives testified, although their grand jury testimony was read aloud at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Guzman and Benefield, Bell was black. Race didn't figure as prominently in the case because Cooper, 40, and Isnora, 29, are black, and Oliver, 36, is of Lebanese descent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite their acquittal yesterday on all criminal charges in the fatal shooting of an unarmed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Nov. 25, 2006, detectives Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper are not in the clear, police sources say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman ruled that the detectives bore no criminal responsibility for Bell's death or for the wounding of his two friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman found that the state's case was riddled with problems and that the prosecutors had failed to overcome the cops' claim that they fired in self-defence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police fired 50 shots that killed Bell and wounded two of his friends after a bachelor party. The cops said that they suspected, based on what Isnora and others witnessed outside the Kalua Cabaret, that Guzman might have had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although no gun was ever found, Guzman's movements in Bell's car led Isnora, who had been struck by the car as it attempted to drive away, to yell out &quot;gun&quot; and then commence firing 11 shots. That shooting sparked the firing by Oliver, who discharged 31 shots, and Cooper, who fired four times. Other cops who weren't indicted fired the remainder of the 50 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman said some witnesses had major credibility problems because they had given inconsistent statements on the witness stand, in the grand jury and in meetings with prosecutors, or had an interest in the outcome of the trial because of lawsuits. The latter was an apparent reference to Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, two friends of Bell who were wounded in the incident and are suing the New York Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the trio could face departmental charges, as could Lt. Gary Napoli, the supervisor in charge the night </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot dead outside club Kalua Cabaret, sources say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD, as it normally does when there is a pending criminal trial, has essentially sat on the sidelines waiting for the trial to end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the verdict, the U.S. Justice Department yesterday announced it would &quot;conduct an independent review of the facts and circumstances&quot; surrounding the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If federal authorities do not make a case against the detectives, it is likely NYPD Internal Affairs investigators will quickly decide whether the cops would be brought up on departmental charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of the matter is a series of what police sources have described as tactical missteps, starting with Napoli, who acknowledged in testimony that the ill-fated operation at the club was poorly planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources say Napoli failed to take control of the situation, setting in motion the chain of events leading to the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, questions were raised when Isnora, who had been inside the club working undercover, confronted Bell and his friends as they got into Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, an undercover officer is not supposed to get involved in any arrest because it compromises his cover, though Police Commissioner Ray Kelly has said circumstances sometimes make that tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, meanwhile, could face charges for firing 31 shots. Police officers are trained to shoot until they are sure there is no longer a threat, but sources say investigators do not feel Oliver ever paused to properly assess the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of whether there are departmental charges, sources say there is virtually no chance that Oliver and Isnora, and maybe even Cooper, will ever work on the streets again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Harlem yesterday afternoon, Al Sharpton called the verdict &quot;an abortion of justice&quot; and promised nonviolent demonstrations in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Sharpton, Nicole Paultre Bell and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parents walked away without commenting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - The loudest sob in the courtroom may have been the one emitted by Michael Oliver, the New York police detective and Clifton native.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As state Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Cooperman read aloud the words &quot;not guilty&quot; Friday morning, ending an eight-week trial in the shooting death of 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oliver leaned forward, clutched his face and let out a choked sob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tears streaked the 36-year-old veteran cop's face as he stood and hugged his lead defense attorney, James Culleton. Oliver had faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted of first-degree manslaughter, the most serious of six criminal and misdemeanor charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His reaction was the most visceral among the three police detectives on trial. And it was in stark contrast to the stoic, intense calm he had presented since the mistaken police fusillade outside a Queens, N.Y., strip club that ended the life of Bell hours before his planned wedding in November 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working as part of an undercover investigation of suspected prostitution at the Kalua Cabaret, Oliver fired 31 of the 50 bullets police aimed at Bell's Nissan Altima after it hit Detective Gescard Isnora, then twice struck an unmarked police van. An autopsy revealed that one of Oliver's bullets killed Bell, of Jamaica, Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Isnora and a third co-defendant, Detective Marc Cooper, also were found not guilty by Cooperman on Friday. The judge heard the case without a jury at the defense team's request. And in a brief news conference Friday afternoon, the officers spoke for the first time about the case. Cooper apologized for Bell's death, although none of the four bullets he fired hit the victim's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;I'd like to thank the Lord, my savior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, acquittal does not mean the end of the police officers' legal troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's family and the two men injured in the police shooting, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, have filed a lawsuit against New York. Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Benton Campell of Brooklyn said his office is reviewing whether evidence shows the officers violated Bell's civil rights. And NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who declined to comment on the decision, hinted that the three officers may face administrative censure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promise of more litigation did little on Friday to allay the disappointment of Bell's family and the hundreds of supporters who packed the courtroom and clogged the sidewalks outside the state Supreme Court complex in Queens. Many gasped at the verdict and sobbed. William and Valerie Bell, the slain man's parents, clutched hands and remained seated in the third row of the courtroom. Nicole Paultre-Bell, who was to marry their son, fled the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Oliver's family sat and expressed their relief. His mother, Yvonne, and sister, Geraldine, wept in the rear of the courtroom. Oliver's father, Norman, just stared into the distance and chewed gum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, they walked out of the court complex from a secluded entrance. Their expressions were serious and their voices grave as they said &quot;no comment&quot; to reporters. The three then stepped into a black Ford sport utility vehicle and were driven north on Queens Boulevard, past the crowds of reporters and throngs of protestors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Clifton, members of Oliver's family remained inside his grandmother's home, near the city's border with Paterson. Several reporters from the New York tabloids camped out across the street, while Clifton police officers regularly patrolled the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver will not grant an interview about the Bell trial, according to a police union representative for the officer. And so far, his only words about the courtroom experience came during Friday's press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The picture of calm returned once again, Oliver spoke briefly and thanked Cooperman for the not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For about 40 minutes, the front of the court complex was chaotic. Helicopters hovered overhead. Television reporters practiced their lines. Activists picketed. Some carried banners that read, &quot;Justice for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... 50 More Reasons for a Revolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen people marched in a circle chanting anti-police slogans: &quot;NYPD, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide,&quot; they chimed. Dozens of police officers, dressed in royal blue polo shirts, silently formed arm-to-arm chains to control the flows of human traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd turned as William and Valerie Bell, wearing sunglasses, led a long procession down the courthouse steps. William Bell, dressed in an ivory white suit and hat, briefly lifted his hand in a faint wave to the hundreds who had massed outside. The crowd followed the family and then mostly dispersed once it left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was 10 a.m. and back to business as usual at the courthouse. A line of people were allowed in to answer summonses and take care of other business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the anger did not disappear with the crowds. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has operated as a spokesman for Bell's family, called the ruling &quot;an abortion of justice.&quot; Others echoed the civil rights activist's sentiment and called out Cooperman by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The eyes of God are upon him, that wicked judge,&quot; said Fay E. Persaud, of Jamaica, Queens. &quot;The wrath of God is upon Cooperman. He did this because he is retiring and he doesn't give a damn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 74-year-old jurist is less than two years away from mandatory retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many said Cooperman's ruling was proof that the judicial system is stacked against black men when police are the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's odd,&quot; said Will Reese, an activist from Harlem, &quot;is when the police get convicted of anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman explained his verdict as he delivered it. He said that while questions remain about the officers' competence and tactical training, he found the prosecution just did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers' actions were criminal. He said Isnora, who fired the first shot at Bell's car, had reason to believe that Bell's friend, Joseph Guzman, was reaching for a gun when Isnora attempted to stop the vehicle, which had just lightly struck his leg. The judge said the sometimes inconsistent, nonsensical and combative testimony of prosecution witnesses also harmed the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's next</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While three NYPD detectives were acquitted on Friday in state Supreme Court in Queens of all criminal charges in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in November 2006 and the wounding of his two friends, the officers and the city potentially face a long legal road ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* $50 million lawsuit: Fianc&eacute;e Nicole Paultre-Bell, and the two men injured in the police shooting, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, have filed a $50 million civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit against New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Federal charges: U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell of Brooklyn is reviewing the Bell case and may bring federal civil rights charges against NYPD Detectives Michael Oliver of Clifton, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper, who were involved in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Administrative action: New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly hinted Friday that the NYPD may bring disciplinary charges against the three officers involved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur J. Cooperman, who delivered the verdict, said many of the prosecution's witnesses, including Bell's friends and the two wounded victims, were simply not believable. &quot;The testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His verdict prompted several supporters of Bell to storm out of the courtroom, and screams could be heard in the hallway moments later. The three detectives -- Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper -- were escorted out of a side doorway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict comes 17 months to the day since the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting of Bell, 23, and his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, outside the Club Kalua in Jamaica, Queens, hours before Bell was to be married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was delivered in a packed courtroom and was heard by, among others, the slain man's parents and his fianc&eacute;e.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- Three detectives were acquitted Friday in the fatal shooting of an unarmed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in November 2006, provoking an outpouring of emotions inside and outside courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman ruled that the detectives, Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper, bore no criminal responsibility for Bell's death or for the wounding of his two friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, the U.S. Justice Department announced it would &quot;conduct an independent review of the facts and circumstances&quot; surrounding the case. The department said it &quot;will take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Harlem on Friday afternoon, the Rev. Al Sharpton called the verdict &quot;an abortion of justice&quot; and promised nonviolent demonstrations in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Mayor Michael Bloomberg emphasized that the judge's responsibility was to decide the case based on the evidence presented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no winners in a trial like this,&quot; Bloomberg said in a statement. &quot;An innocent man lost his life, a bride lost her groom, two daughters lost their father, and a mother and a father lost their son. No verdict could ever end the grief of those who knew and loved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, where scores of police officers stood alert, many in the crowd began weeping after hearing the verdict. Others were enraged, swearing and screaming &quot;Murderers! Murderers!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before announcing the verdict, the judge made a statement indicating that he thought the police officers' version of events was more credible than that of the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant was not justified&quot; in shooting the victims, Cooperman said. About the version of events offered by the victims and other prosecution witnesses, he said, &quot;At times the testimony just didn't make sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the three New York Police Department detectives involved in the shooting death of Bell, who was killed in a hail of gunfire outside a club just hours before he was to be married in 2006, had faced a maximum of 25 years in prison if convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Sharpton, Nicole Paultre Bell and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parents, surrounded by security, walked away without commenting and went to the Long Island cemetery where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is buried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an afternoon news conference, Isnora thanked the judge for his &quot;fair and accurate decision.&quot; Oliver also thanked the judge, as well as family and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper took a deep breath, shrugged his shoulders and said, &quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said the judge arrived at his verdict &quot;fairly and conscientiously under the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I accept his verdict,&quot; Brown said, &quot;and urge all law-abiding citizens of this city to do the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the police union was &quot;grateful for this outcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With this case there's no winners, there's no losers. We still have police officers that have to live with the fact that there was a death involved with their case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Palladino, president of New York City's Detectives Endowment Association, emphasized that each day detectives go to work &quot;they don't want to be injured and they don't want to hurt anybody else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three undercover detectives charged in the case elected to have a judge decide their fate, rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of the officers resulted in seven weeks of often-conflicting testimonies about the death of Bell, 23, who was killed in a 50-bullet barrage outside the Kalua Cabaret in New York in the early morning of Nov. 25, 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman and Benefield were shot and injured. Oliver, 36, fired at the car Bell was in 31 times. Isnora, 29, fired 11 times, Cooper, 40, fired four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have said that during their undercover investigation of the Queens strip club, the officers believed someone in the group with Bell had gone to the car to get a gun. Other cops who weren't indicted fired the remainder of the 50 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial Isnora testified that following a dispute between patrons, he heard Guzman say: &quot;Yo, go get my gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers claimed they began shooting only after Bell bumped Isnora, who had identified himself as an officer, with his car, slamming him into an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Guzman and Benefield testified they were unaware police had been watching them and said the gunfire erupted without any warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No weapon was ever found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Three New York City detectives were found not guilty on Friday in the shooting death of an unarmed black man killed in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day, prompting angry reactions and a federal review of the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York state judge cleared two police officers of manslaughter and other charges and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in Nov. 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But federal authorities said they would consider civil rights charges in the case in a review to be conducted by the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will &quot;take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes,&quot; the Justice Department said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, hundreds of demonstrators yelled angrily, and there was pushing and shoving in the crowd as police, reporters and spectators packed the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, who has been highly critical of police and is influential in New York's black community, called for wider protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want us to act crazy so they would have an excuse to do more,&quot; Sharpton told the audience of his radio show. &quot;We are going to be strategic. We are going to close the city down in a nonviolent effective way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for calm after the verdict, saying, &quot;We don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case had generated outrage in New York's black community, though police said they did not expect violence because numerous demonstrations against the perceived police brutality had remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows that there is no justice in America for the black man. This is telling us the cops can do whatever they want and get away with it,&quot; said B.M. Marcus, a community organizer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquitted officers gave brief statements thanking their friends and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; said detective Marc Cooper, who had been charged only with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two detectives, Gescard Isnora and Mike Oliver, were charged with manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three defendants waived their right to a jury trial and decided to have the judge decide guilt or innocence. The defence lawyers said jurors in the borough of Queens were likely to be biased against the policemen due to the intense media coverage generated by the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Supreme Court Judge Arthur Cooperman said the charges could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, noting that some prosecution witnesses contradicted themselves from prior statements and may have had motivation to lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At times the testimony just didn't make sense,&quot; Cooperman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge gave credibility to the detectives' statements that they believed they were in danger but also offered, &quot;Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight-week trial centered on whether the detectives had reason to believe they faced imminent danger and whether they made it clear to Bell and the two survivors that they were police officers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper have been on trial since Feb. 25 for the shooting on Nov. 25, 2006. Two of Bell's friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, were wounded and testified against the officers. Bell and his group had just left his bachelor party at the Club Kalua when the fatal 50-shot encounter with the police happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora and Oliver are charged with manslaughter and Cooper with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of police precautions, scores of officers will be posted outside the Queens courthouse where the three detectives will learn their fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other officers will be assigned to Club Kalua and the Baisley Park Houses, the Queens housing project that was the scene of tensions after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Al Sharpton, who has advocated on behalf of the victims, denounced the preparations, calling suggestions that rioting may result from an acquittal insulting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We never participated in or engaged in violence,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;Maybe you ought to ask people who believe it's all right to shoot 50 times at unarmed men how they are going to react.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S JUDGMENT DAY in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After eight weeks, 56 witnesses and hundreds of hours of testimony, Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman hands down his verdict on the three cops who killed Bell on his wedding day with a 50-bullet barrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper opted for a bench trial, believing they'd have a better chance of acquittal from the judge rather than a jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Isnora, who fired 11 times, are charged with manslaughter, felony assault and reckless endangerment. They face up to 25 years in prison if convicted on all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, who fired four times, is charged with reckless endangerment. He faces up to a year in jail if convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the detectives testified, although their grand jury testimony was read aloud at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the hours counted down, Bell's parents and his grieving fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre Bell, took part in a prayer vigil at the Community Church of Christ in the Jamaica section of Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accused cops, who are on modified leave and have surrendered their guns, laid low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With eight different criminal charges to choose from, Cooperman has multiple options on how to rule. He could acquit or convict all of the cops on all of the charges. Or he could issue a mixed verdict, upholding some of the charges against some of the detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman also has the option of splitting up the individual charges - such as convicting either Oliver or Isnora of a charge in which they're accused of acting in concert, the experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if acquitted, the detectives still face departmental hearings where they could be stripped of their badges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, was killed on Nov. 25, 2006, near the Queens strip club where he'd just had his bachelor bash. His friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were badly wounded when the cops opened fire on Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman, Benefield and Paultre Bell will be in Queens Supreme Court with the Rev. Al Sharpton when the verdict is read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the victims are all black, race hasn't figured as prominently in the case because Cooper is also black, Isnora is half-black, and Oliver is of Lebanese descent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton has accused Isnora and Cooper of playing the race card by hiring African-American lawyers Anthony Ricco and Paul Martin to defend them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find that to be profoundly offensive,&quot; said Martin, who represents Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview with the Daily News on the eve of the verdict, Bell's grieving parents, William and Valerie, called for calm no matter what the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm looking for, of course, the judge to give the right verdict,&quot; Valerie Bell said. &quot;I'm looking for serenity and peace, and humbleness among the people whatever the verdict might be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though not anticipating any violence, the NYPD has quietly put its manpower on alert, The News learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not the city of old,&quot; Mayor Bloomberg said. &quot;People today have a much greater respect for the law and confidence that justice is served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, 36; Isnora, 29; and Cooper, 40, were part of an undercover police unit that was doing a prostitution sting at the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens, when they tragically crossed paths with Bell and his buddies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reaching his verdict, Cooperman had to consider two simple yet competing arguments - either the police were reckless and overreacted or the victims were acting like thugs and brought it on themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense team says the cops fired because they believed Guzman was reaching for a gun when Isnora stepped in front of Bell's car and declared, &quot;Police, show your hands!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No gun was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver's lawyer, James Culleton, accused prosecutors of building a case on the testimony of &quot;a parade of convicted felons, crack dealers and men who were not strangers to weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton charged that Guzman and Benefield, both of whom have police records, and their street thug friends framed the detectives to win their $50 million suit against the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said Bell, Guzman and Benefield were the victims of poorly led, trigger-happy cops, who fired first and then came up with a shaky story about a confrontation between Bell and a mystery man outside the club to justify their &quot;excessive&quot; use of force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S ONE for the books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter what Justice Arthur Cooperman's verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial is today, court watchers will remember the prosecution of this case as one of the strangest ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never saw a case prosecuted like this,&quot; Marvyn Kornberg, the noted defense lawyer, said several times during the trial. &quot;It's a throw-everything-at-the-wall approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Murphy, who won the only acquittal in the sensational Howard Beach trial in the very same Queens courtroom 21 years ago, is still scratching his head. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've thought all along that these cops were going to be acquitted because the prosecution made major blunders in the case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To start with, the prosecution should never have read the grand jury testimony of the three cops into the record because it basically precluded the defendants from taking the stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murphy says once the cops' versions of the shooting were on the record in the trial, there was no way the defense was going to expose them to cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the prosecution hadn't done that, the defense would have seriously had to consider making their clients take the stand,&quot; Murphy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I couldn't find a defense lawyer who could explain why the prosecution never prepared their star witnesses for crossexamination concerning their conflicting statements to police, prosecutors and the grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the star witnesses contradicted themselves in major, material ways throughout the trial,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;Sometimes their statements were tape-recorded. Or written in the DA's own notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prosecution also put on police witnesses who developed sudden amnesia. Most of the major prosecution witnesses, the police and friends of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helped the defense more than the prosecution. It's incredible that an NYPD lieutenant testified that after the shooting he never bothered to ask his men what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another lawyer, who preferred to remain nameless, who used to work for the Queens district attorney's office, said politics is the only reason the case was brought to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was an angry split in the Queens DA's office over bringing an indictment. One faction led by Jack Ryan, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown's top aide, argued that there wasn't enough evidence. The other faction said prosecutors owed it to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> loved ones, the shooting victims and &quot;the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Traditionally, the Queens DA's office assembled their best ADAs and made them build a great defense of the suspect,&quot; the lawyer said. &quot;If the defense was stronger than the prosecution's case, you didn't go into the grand jury. Judging by his own admission during summation that he could not vouch for some of his own witnesses, it's difficult to believe that [lead prosecutor Charles] Testagrossa could have analyzed this case and come away convinced the prosecution had a more compelling case than the defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lawyer said that leaves one answer: &quot;Queens DA Brown, bowing to public pressure from the African-American community, especially after Mayor Bloomberg said this shooting seemed 'excessive,' told Testagrossa to bring an indictment for political reasons. Remember, Brown and Bloomberg are friends and Brown depends on City Hall for funding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about his prosecution strategy, Testagrossa told one Daily News reporter, &quot;It is what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That comment - and the prosecution's tactics during the trial, brought smiles to the faces of many local lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if Cooperman finds the cops guilty, I just wish the Queens DA would prosecute all its cases like this one,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;In front of a jury, it would be a defense lawyer's dream.&quot;`</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laura Harper-Paultre said she also prayed that there will be peace in Queens &quot;no matter what.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what the verdict is, it won't bring Sean back,&quot; she said. &quot;I just prayed for justice. But no matter what it is, Sean is dead. Guilty or not guilty, Sean is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harper-Paultre spoke at the Community Church of Christ in the Jamaica section, where about a dozen Bell supporters gathered for a 24-hour prayer vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mother, Valerie, stopped by a few hours later after work. &quot;It's in God's hands right now,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's father, William, and fianc&eacute;e, Nicole, were expected to take part in the vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning, Bell supporters will march from the church to Queens Supreme Court, where Justice Arthur Cooperman will read his verdict shortly after 9 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miraculously, I don't feel any anxiety,&quot; Harper-Paultre said. &quot;I'm very optimistic about tomorrow. I have faith in Judge Cooperman and in God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was killed on his wedding day, Nov. 25, 2006, around the corner from a Queens topless club where he'd just had his bachelor party. Two buddies who were in Bell's car, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were badly wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly afterward, Bell's fianc&eacute;e legally took his last name. She is the mother of Bell's two daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Lester Williams said, &quot;I feel like a person who has been sentenced to die in an electric chair and this is my last day on earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been a burden on the community,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Today is the eve of the unknown . . . Our prayers here are that the citizens will respect the decision of the judge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora are charged with manslaughter, felony assault and reckless endangerment. Detective Marc Cooper is charged with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballistics evidence:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of deformed bullets, bullet shards and shell casings - including the deadly lead pieces removed from Bell's body and the projectiles that injured his friends. Prosecutors also showed pictures and video of the AirTrain station, where passengers scattered at the moment Detective Marc Cooper's bullet flew through the glass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injuries:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors included a closeup snapshot of Detective Gescard Isnora's skinned shin, where he said Bell drove into his leg, which the defense used to claim that he had reason to fear for his life. Prosecutors used illustrations, X-rays and MRIs to describe the damage from Guzman's wounds, which ran from his neck to his ankle. Medical experts testified about Guzman's injuries, including intestinal damage and nerve damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Car:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of photos depicted the massive damage to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> car, which included shattered glass inside and out, deep gashes in the metal and the seats, and blood-spattered interior. In one, multicolored crime scene rods marked the damage to the passenger side of 1999 Nissan Altima, where cops said they were aiming. There were also photos of the undercover officers' van, damaged from the two collisions with Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the cops never took the stand, their testimony from the grand jury - in which they described their decision to open fire after fearing for their lives - were introduced by the prosecution, and will be a key factor in the judge's decision. Defense lawyers tried to erode the credibility of survivors Benefield's and Guzman's in-court testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Detective Michael Oliver has endured an eight-week trial in a Queens courtroom and a year-and-a-half-long trial in the New York tabloids and the court of public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is the day of judgment for the Clifton native and two other NYPD detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and the other officers are on trial for the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed man who was killed in November 2006 in a hail of police gunfire outside a seedy Queens strip club, hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Cooperman, who heard the case without a jury, was expected to render his verdict this morning before a packed courtroom of reporters, police officials and friends and family of the slain man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The courtroom will wait to hear whether Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 bullets at Bell's Nissan Altima, and another detective, Gescard Isnora, are guilty of first- and second-degree manslaughter. If convicted, both detectives face up to 25 years in prison. Cooperman also will decide the fate of a third detective, Marc Cooper, who is charged with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His verdict - guilty or not - will cap an explosive case that has haunted both New York and those who have long known Oliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades, New York has been troubled by police shootings of unarmed black men; more troubling to civil rights activists, however, is the fact that the courts have cleared most of the officers involved, including four officers who in 1999 mistakenly unleashed a barrage of bullets on Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, longtime friends of Oliver have said they have been stunned by how vicious he has been painted by New York media, friends and family of Bell and prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He liked to party, but he never had a mean streak in him,&quot; said Tony Zlotkowski, 35, of Clifton, who has known Oliver since high school. He said he hoped Cooperman would find his friend &quot;innocent - you've got to hope for the best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zlotkowski said he spoke with Oliver on a recent Sunday, when the two saw each other at Van Houten Lanes, a Clifton bowling alley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Oliver did not seem to be weighed down by the pending verdict. But when Zlotkowski wished him the best, the words Oliver spoke in response were tinged with resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What am I going to do?&quot; Zlotkowski said Oliver told him. &quot;I'm going to have to live with whatever happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman, 74, has kept a stony countenance throughout the trial, even as heated and emotional testimony unfolded from the witness stand next to him. But either way, an acquittal will not spell the end of Oliver's legal troubles. Bell's widow, Nicole Paultre-Bell, along with Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, the other two men injured in the shooting, have filed a $50 million civil lawsuit against the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the dead man's father, William Bell, who was with his son hours before he was shot, has pledged to press federal prosecutors to try the case as a civil rights matter if the verdict comes back not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts expect the Bell family to win a monetary settlement, but some doubt that the federal government would take up a new criminal complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure that the feds would invest the capital if they're acquitted,&quot; said Adina Schwartz, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. She noted that federal prosecutors tend to be more conservative about the cases they take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very least, Oliver's law-enforcement career, along with those of the others, would be diminished, if not done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would think their careers are in serious jeopardy, regardless of the finding,&quot; Passaic County Prosecutor James Avigliano said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and members of his family have declined to speak to the media about the trial. Oliver also did not take the witness stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the shooting, Bell's parents have slammed Oliver, saying he has shown no remorse as the trial proceeded. His grand jury testimony, which was read aloud during the trial, also was described as &quot;defiant&quot; at times. But there also was a moment of regret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the last thing in the world I ever wanted to do,&quot; he told the grand jury that indicted him, &quot;to kill someone or to hurt someone in their family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to live with that also for the rest of my life,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... While the parties clustered around Joanna's car sorting out the situation, Officer Curtis of the Quincy Police Department arrived.  ... One section discussed the numerous hate crimes committed against Asian Americans in Quincy, including tire slashing, window smashing, egging of windshields, physical assaults, and verbal assaults (&quot;gook&quot;; &quot;chink&quot;; &quot;Go back to China&quot;).  ... As such, co-author Lai helped secure defense lawyers who were open to community organizing.  ... In addition to attending all court hearings and public events and reporting the case in its international newspaper, Militant Labor was instrumental in connecting the issues of immigrant rights and police brutality through its newspaper and its monthly forum held in Boston.  ... After a quick consultation, we decided that the co-authors would go to the Mayor's office as intermediaries, bringing along the Chinese press.  ... The attendees of the meeting represented a wide spectrum of supporters, including Quincy residents; the Executive Secretary of the Mayor of Quincy; representatives from the Quincy Human Rights Commission, the Massachusetts Alliance of Portuguese Speakers, and various unions and immigrant groups; others who had worked with Karen on campaigns, and still other concerned citizens, including many Whites.  ... The film depicted a surge of anti-Asian violence in Massachusetts throughout the 1980s, highlighting the Huang case in Boston Chinatown as well as incidents in Chelsea, Revere, and Quincy.  ... According to the 1989 Patriot Ledger report, Asian American victims often sought only an apology from their perpetrators, rather than invoking the law to hold them accountable.  ... The harsh sentences given to the Quincy 4 might be viewed as a statement by the court to future Asian American litigants: do not waste the court's time with a trivial case; take the plea bargain or take a settlement; if you do not cooperate and you are unlucky enough to come before me for sentencing, be forewarned.  ... The letter, to be published as an advertisement, read: For fourteen months, we have supported four Asian Americans (Karen Chen, Howard Ng, Quan Thin and Tat Yuen) in their quest to clear their names after being pepper-sprayed and beaten up by several Quincy police officers and then prosecuted for crimes that they insisted they did not commit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">HIGHLIGHT: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We dedicate this article to the six Asian Americans who placed their libertyand good names on the line to speak out against police brutality and to test the promise of equal justice for all. We make a special dedication to Karen Chen,whose tenacity, generosity and leadership throughout this case awakened othersto recognize that civil rights are an Asian American issue. We believe that theprivate agonies of these individuals and the community's journey alongside themthroughout this ordeal should not be silenced by the ultimate outcomes of the criminal trial. It is in this spirit that we wrote this article.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Introduction<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The case of the &quot;Quincy 4&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n1</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revolves around an encounter between &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*74]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  four Asian Americans and the police in Quincy, Massachusetts on the eve of &quot;The Great American Strike of 2006&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the resulting criminal prosecutions. The four victims and their supporters assert that the police used excessive force in making the arrests, whereas the police and other Quincy residents paint the incident as a simple case of young adults misbehaving. Unlike other well-known incidents involving excessive force against the African American and Latino communities, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this case involved no serious physical injuries. Still, this case raises several questions, the answers to which prove illuminative. First, given that there are few documented cases of police brutality or excessive force in the Asian American community, how have various sectors in this community reacted to the case? Second, since Asian Americans are typified as the &quot;model minority,&quot; how do the mainstream public and press view this case? Third, in case of similar future incidents, how could the organizing principles and strategies used in this case be put to use? Last, since many cities and towns are, like Quincy, experiencing growth in Asian American populations, what lessons can we draw from this incident?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors write this article not primarily as the Quincy 4's criminal defense attorneys. We write as community lawyers who counseled each of the Quincy 4 as well as the surrounding Asian American community &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*75]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  throughout the case, with a personal interest in protecting individual liberties and building the community's political power. To further these two aims, we helped the victims secure defense lawyers and helped coordinate legal and organizing strategies. Both authors have extensive experience working with and within the Asian American community as legal services lawyers, teachers, and activists. As lawyers, we have both worked on numerous campaigns, struggles, and a myriad of policy reforms that affect the Asian American community in Massachusetts and beyond. Our involvement in this case was both logical and expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section II of this article presents the background of the &quot;Quincy 4&quot; case. Section III addresses the history of Asian American migration into Quincy and of anti-Asian violence in the city during the 1980s. Sections IV and V address the organizing strategies and challenges in mobilizing the community around the case. Here, we discuss how Quincy's history of anti-Asian violence, coupled with a reluctance to &quot;make waves&quot; and with a bipolar Black/White view of civil rights, deterred many Asian Americans from engaging in the campaign. In Section VI, we examine media coverage of the case and consequences for different communities' responses to the verdict and sentencing. In Section VII, we revisit the trial and examine the jury deliberation process and historical parallels between this case and People v. Hall, namely concerning the deployment of Asian American stereotypes during the trial to the victims' detriment. In Section VIII, we discuss how the guilty verdict and the disproportionate sentencing silenced the Asian American community. In Section IX, we discuss lessons learned about organizing Asian Americans for social change. Section X addresses lessons learned as community lawyers. We touch on tensions between community lawyering principles and organizing goals; we discern the success in this seeming defeat. In closing, we argue that we must &quot;put race back on the table&quot; in order to highlight civil rights as an Asian American issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. Background History of the Case<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The events of the Quincy 4 case started around 12:45 a.m. on April 30, 2006 along a major thoroughfare in the City of Quincy near Wollaston, a neighborhood that is home to many Asian American residents and businesses. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Facts of the Case<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On that fateful morning, six individuals - two of whom had celebrated their engagement with family and friends a few hours earlier - were on their way to their respective homes in two separate cars. One car was &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*76]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  driven by the bride-to-be, Ying Mei Cheung, with the groom-to-be Tat Man Yuen in the front seat and two friends, Karen Chen and Howard Ng, in the back seat. In the other car, Joanna Ng was driving with her boyfriend Quan Thin. During the drive, Joanna and Quan began to argue. Joanna parked against the curb on Hancock Street outside the parking lot of a Chinese supermarket, exited the car, and walked toward a 7-Eleven to get a bottle of water. Still upset, she passed the convenience store, called her friends in the other car, and asked them to pick her up and drive Quan home. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During this time, a state trooper had pulled up behind Joanna's parked car and began a verbal exchange with Quan. The trooper alleged that Quan appeared drunk and was &quot;confrontational&quot; even though Quan had complied with his requests. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few minutes after the trooper arrived, the car driven by Mei Ying Cheung picked up Joanna and pulled up behind the parked cruiser. Joanna and Karen Chen exited the car to investigate the situation between Quan and the trooper. As they approached, Joanna had her driver's license in hand to inform the trooper that she was the driver and owner of the car. Howard Ng also exited the car to stand by Quan on the passenger side of Joanna's car as Karen and Joanna talked to the trooper. While the parties clustered around Joanna's car sorting out the situation, Officer Curtis of the Quincy Police Department arrived. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within a minute or so, he deployed pepper spray on the faces of Quan, Howard, and Karen &quot;in a sweeping motion&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> without warning or provocation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howard and Karen immediately &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*77]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  moved away from the car and into the parking lot. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quan was moved to the front hood of Joanna's car and handcuffed by the trooper. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point, at least two other officers from the Quincy Police Department arrived. One, Officer Folan, blocked Tat from approaching Joanna's car as his friends were dispersed and crouched on the ground. By then, Karen began to wail in pain as she felt the pepper spray's effects in her eyes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An officer told Karen not to rub her eyes and threatened to arrest her if she did not keep quiet. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within seconds, three police officers tackled Karen to the ground, ripped her jacket off, tore her blouse, and handcuffed her. Tat, who tried to come to her aid, was knocked to the ground unconscious. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howard and Tat were then arrested also. Quan, Howard, Tat, and Karen were taken to the Quincy Police Department for booking. Before returning the keys and car registration to Joanna, Officer Curtis twice questioned her as to where she was from. When she did not &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*78]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respond as he expected, Officer Curtis told her, &quot;Go back to Somerville, they might do things differently there.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of this encounter, Karen received a black eye and sustained bruises on her head, elbows, and lower back. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her blouse was torn at the neck and on the sides. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tat suffered a concussion. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On top of inflicting these injuries, the Quincy Police charged Karen, Quan, and Tat with two offenses each </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: disorderly conduct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and resisting arrest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Howard, who remained quiet throughout the incident, was charged only with disorderly conduct. All four were arraigned at the Quincy District Court on May 1, 2006. In the ensuing fourteen months, five pre-trial hearings took place. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. The Trial<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On June 18, 2007, nearly fourteen months after the incident, a jury trial occurred. At the outset, presiding judge Mary Orfanello urged the parties to resolve the case. The prosecutor made a tentative offer to dismiss the case if the parties would agree to a mutual release, which would have protected the Quincy police from potential civil claims in exchange for a pre-trial probation disposition on the criminal case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The offer was rescinded, however, when Quincy's Corporate Counsel rejected the compromise because she believed that it left the city open to future lawsuits by the parties. The only outstanding offer was to dismiss Howard's case if he would provide a written apology to the Quincy Police and waive all &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*79]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense rejected the offer and chose to proceed to trial for all four defendants. Jury selection took one and a half days. Of the thirty-seven potential jurors in the pool, only one was a person of color. The final jury consisted of three men and five women; the lone Black juror was the only person of color. The prosecution's case consisted of the testimonies of six police officers, two of whom were involved only post-arrest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite Judge Orfanello's jury instructions that the defendants' post-arrest conduct could not be used to prove the resisting arrest allegation, she allowed the two officers to testify to the defendants' alleged unruly behavior during the transportation and booking processes. Obviously, the jury would have taken in all the allegations - jury instructions given at the end of the trial would have been too late to remedy any prejudicial impact created during the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense's witness, Joanna Ng, was one of two people at the scene who faced no criminal charges. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joanna corroborated the trooper's testimony that the parties were at peace when Officer Curtis arrived. She contradicted Officer Curtis' claim that he had to deploy pepper spray because the parties were &quot;out of control.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, she testified that Karen was sitting on the ground screaming because her eyes hurt, that Karen was neither unruly nor threatening, and that Karen was not screaming at the police or interfering with the police action. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joanna also told the court that for a split second, she lost sight of Karen but saw three officers piling on top of the spot where Karen had been only seconds earlier. She pointed out that the picture showing her crouching on the ground depicted the moment when she lost sight of Karen behind the pile of officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She indicated that, immediately following, she saw Karen being pulled up by the handcuffs behind her back. Joanna also noticed that Karen's jacket was &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*80]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  wrapped around her ankle and tripping her. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers admitted that the photograph depicted their actions that night. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officer Folan, who was standing a few feet away from the commotion, claimed that he was so focused on Tat, whom he knocked unconscious to the ground, that he did not notice the officers jumping on Karen. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State trooper McGrail, on the other hand, claimed that he was so focused on Quan - already handcuffed, pepper-sprayed, and pressed face-down on the hood of the car - that he did not see or hear anything happening a few feet away. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial ended around noon on Friday, June 22, 2007. The jury was charged to deliberate around 2:40 p.m. that afternoon, after almost an hour of jury instructions. At around 4:50 p.m. the jury returned to the court room with an acquittal for Howard and guilty verdicts for the other three defendants. Quan was found guilty on both charges, Tat was found guilty of disorderly conduct, and Karen was found guilty of resisting arrest. The prosecutor asked for probation periods of up to two years for the three convicted defendants but did not seek jail time. After a round of appeals by the defense, the judge issued sentences much harsher than what the prosecution recommended. The judge sentenced Quan to a six-month suspended sentence at the house of correction, of which he was immediately to serve ten days; two years of probation; attendance in an Alcoholic Anonymous program three times a week through his probationary period; and random urine testing. The judge also instructed the court officer to handcuff Quan and remove him from the court in front of a roomful of stunned supporters. After learning that Karen was a tenant services coordinator at a public housing development in Boston Chinatown, the judge sentenced her to eighteen months of probation. For a conviction of disorderly conduct, Judge Orfanello sentenced Tat to six months in the house of correction, of which he was immediately to serve ten days, and two years of probation. The court officer handcuffed Tat as well and removed him from the court immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. Asian American Demographics in Quincy<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The case of the Quincy 4 must be examined in the context of a growing Asian American population in Quincy, Massachusetts, a city roughly seven miles southeast of Boston. Based on the 2000 U.S. Census, Quincy has a population of about 88,000, of which Asian Americans comprise 15.7% and Whites comprise 81%. The Asian American population in Quincy grew from 5,554 in 1990 to 13,546 in 2000: an &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*81]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  increase of 143.9%. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, Quincy was built on its granite quarrying and ship building industries. The economic downturn of both industries led to a focus on expanding the retail and commercial sectors with an emphasis on the building of residential neighborhoods. Quincy - with its proximity to Boston, cheaper real estate, and easy access to public transit and major highways - became a magnet for Asian immigrants in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influx of Asians via immigration and refugee resettlement in the late 1970s and early 1980s reflected a nationwide trend. Like many other racially homogenous cities experiencing a surge of new immigrants, Quincy had its share of growing pains. By the late 1980s when Asians were attempting to establish roots in their new homes, hate crimes became a major issue. Several cases of anti-Asian violence surfaced across Massachusetts. A surge of hate crimes against Southeast Asians occurred in Boston, Dorchester, Revere, Chelsea, and Lynn, as well as Quincy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Quincy boasts a growing Asian population, with Asian Americans comprising 15% to 20% of the population. Twenty years have passed since the tumultuous 1980s, but it remains to be seen whether Quincy has learned to address its Asian American residents' civil rights concerns and to provide accessible service to this community'. An examination of the case of the Quincy 4 can shed light on these issues as pertinent not only to Quincy, but also to other cities facing a growing Asian American population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Review of Anti-Asian Violence in the 1980s in Quincy<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Before discussing the Quincy 4 case, it is instructive to present some historical background. A 1989 Patriot Ledger </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> report focused on the arrival of Asian Americans into Quincy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and highlighted many related social issues. One section discussed the numerous hate crimes committed against Asian Americans in Quincy, including tire slashing, window &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*82]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  smashing, egging of windshields, physical assaults, and verbal assaults (&quot;gook&quot;; &quot;chink&quot;; &quot;Go back to China&quot;). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a newspaper poll of 400 white and Asian American residents of Quincy, supplemented with over 200 interviews, almost one-third of Asian Americans polled experienced racial discrimination. On two particular streets, &quot;seven of eleven Asian American families reported smashed car windows, spray-painted racial slurs, or house windows hit by snowballs or rocks. One window was shattered by BBs from an air gun. The homes or cars of five families have been vandalized more than once.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the astoundingly high rate of victimization, few incidents were reported. 82% of Asian Americans polled by the Patriot Ledger said that, regardless of whether the crime was racially motivated, they did not notify the police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This meant that for every reported anti-Asian incident, six went unreported. This report further stated: &quot;Since September [1988], [Sergeant Thomas] Casey has investigated 16 cases of vandalism, assault and harassment against Asian Americans. He determined that 14 were civil rights violations. He has made no arrests. A clerk-magistrate declined to issue civil rights charges in Quincy District Court against one suspect.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when victimization is reported, deeper institutional problems exacerbate the problems outlined by the Patriot Ledger report; these problems will be elaborated below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Police Officer Cannot Find Racial Motivation in a Crime<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In April 1998, a North Quincy Asian woman was driving home around midnight when a group of teenagers banged their fists against her car. When she stopped to ask them why, four female teenagers proceeded to beat and kick her until neighbors finally came to her aid and she was taken to the hospital. The woman later reported to police that her attackers directed &quot;discriminatory words&quot; towards her during the beating. However, a police investigation by a civil rights officer revealed no racial motivation behind the attack. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is peculiar, since most hate crime experts understand that racial epithets (i.e., &quot;discriminatory words&quot;) are key indicators of hate crimes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most troubling is that a police officer trained in recognizing &quot;civil rights&quot; violations failed to identify the racially oriented &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*83]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nature and motive of the crime. This failure kept the police from understanding the true nature and scope of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the State Attorney General's Office stepped in, secured temporary restraining orders against the perpetrators, and prosecuted the four teenagers on hate crime charges. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the restraining orders were issued, the police officer in charge of the Quincy Police Department's Civil Rights Unit - the officer who had denied hate crime motives in the case - was quoted as saying, &quot;this sends a message to those thinking of this type of activity that it will not be tolerated. This policy will be enforced by this department, and you can rest assured this injunction will be reinforced by this department.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can only speculate as to why the officer changed his opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Clerk Magistrate Will Not Issue Civil Rights Charges<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In a 1998 case involving a white youth's harassment of a group of Asian Americans on Halloween, the district attorney and the police sought to prosecute a 17-year old Quincy High School senior for hate crime violations. The defendant, along with four friends, allegedly threw eggs and yelled racial slurs at two Chinese American youths while driving through a neighborhood. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In January of 1989, the Clerk Magistrate in Quincy District Court determined that there was insufficient evidence to issue a hate crime warrant against the white youth, despite the defendant's admission that he threw eggs at the Chinese American's car and kicked in a car window. Charges were dropped in exchange for the defendant's agreement to write a letter of apology to the two victims. This outcome frustrated the efforts of the District Attorney's office and the police to address an ongoing problem. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can only wonder in how many other instances had local court personnel thwarted hate crime prosecutions by wielding discretionary powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Prevailing Attitudes of Police Officers<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Patriot Ledger report also included interviews of six Quincy police officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though not representative of the police department as a whole, this report provides a window into police attitudes. The Quincy &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*84]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Department had been known for its innovative approach to civil rights issues. In addressing the rise of anti-Asian violence, the police chief appointed a civil rights officer, persuaded the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office to draft a policy that prioritized civil rights cases, and brought in experts to conduct sensitivity training of all officers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One officer's view of these initiatives was that the city had turned Asians Americans' civil rights into a cause celebre: &quot;First it was battered woman [sic], then it was drunk driving, now it's civil rights. A guy yells &quot;gook' and they put him behind bars. Let's be careful we don't screw up someone's life just because they yelled &quot;gook'.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding language barriers, some officers believed that Asian Americans feign ignorance of English in order to avoid charges: &quot;They play that no-speaky-English game ... you don't know it for sure, but you feel it. You know when they're driving the Volvo and the lady's dressed in clothes from Lord and Taylor that gives you some cause to wonder.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not these sentiments signify an institutional problem in Quincy, they cast negative light on the Police Department. The apparent situation is one of white officials overlooking cases of Asian American victimization and exercising leniency in cases where Whites were the perpetrators. All things being equal, city officials should have been concerned with such tendencies and investigated whether there was a pattern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Justice System's Inability to Prosecute Civil Rights Violation<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In addition to institutional intransigence, further barriers have prevented hate crime prosecutions, as a Northeastern University study illuminates. The study used data from the Boston Police's Community Disorders Unit (&quot;CDU&quot;), whose purpose is to investigate crimes involving racial overtones. Of 452 cases recorded from 1983 to 1987, thirty-eight were tried, eighty-three were deemed unsupported by sufficient evidence, one hundred and twenty-seven were dropped when victims declined to move forward, one hundred and thirty involved no arrested suspects, and twenty-two involved victims declining to press charges. Of the thirty-eight cases tried, six involved civil rights charges, with assault and battery or vandalism allegations comprising the other charges. Of the four hundred and fifty-two cases, only five perpetrators were sent to jail, and only one was convicted of a civil rights violation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asian American victims face multiple hurdles to attaining justice: reluctance to report crimes; lack of cultural and linguistic resources in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*85]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  police department; inability of police to find the perpetrator or identify the nature of the crime; negative attitudes of some police officers toward Asian Americans; and court personnel's discretion and possible biases in handling these cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. The Organizing Strategies<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Quincy 4's organizing strategy was heavily influenced by our collective experience with anti-Asian violence cases and with community organizing generally. Five essential devices emerged from the onset: community meetings, rallying, petitioning, filling of the courtroom, and media outreach. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Support Committee was formed within two weeks of the incident to centralize the organizing of strategies and to carry out discrete campaigns. As this was a criminal proceeding, we knew that overall efforts must be coordinated with the defense team's legal strategy, with the Support Committee serving a clearinghouse function. As such, co-author Lai helped secure defense lawyers who were open to community organizing. Organizing tactics were assessed through the lens of the liberty interests that the defense sought to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Influences of Earlier Anti-Asian Violence Cases<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Most participants in the organizing effort knew of the tragic Vincent Chin case, in which an Asian man was beaten to death in Detroit in 1982, during a time of animosity toward Japanese automobile production. The two white defendants, Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz, never served a day in jail. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, not a single family member of the victim was notified of the court date of the criminal sentencing; the family had to learn through a friend about the lenient sentence of two years' probation and a $ 1,500 fine for each defendant. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boston area activists were also familiar with a local 1985 police brutality case in which a man, Long Guang Huang, had been beaten by a Boston detective who mistakenly accused him of propositioning a white prostitute. Huang was charged with assault, battery, and resisting arrest. After three months of community-based outcries, the 56-year-old Huang was acquitted of all criminal charges and won an $ 85,000 settlement in his civil rights suit against the Boston Police Department. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Significantly, the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*86]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Huang case occurred at the height of publicity surrounding the federal civil rights prosecution of Chin's murderers. The Huang case was thus an opportunity for the Boston community to organize against anti-Asian violence by galvanizing the Asian American community and uniting local political forces. Although the Chinese Progressive Association </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> led the organizing effort, other Boston community organizations supported the campaign wholeheartedly on the premise that an attack on one Asian is an attack on all Asians. These groups included mainstream service organizations such as Boston Chinatown's Josiah Quincy School Community Council and conservative organizations such as the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesson from the Chin case, which saw neither family nor community involvement in the initial criminal trial, is that community members cannot sit by and expect the court to deliver justice. The Huang case proved that if we would mobilize and stay vigilant, the court would take notice. The positive outcomes of the Huang case were echoed and reinforced a few years later by another anti-Asian incident in Lowell, Massachusetts, in the case of Prem Suksawat. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, the lessons of recent history called for us to organize, mobilize, and be vigilant in the Quincy 4 case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Putting the Organizing Strategies to Work<BR>&nbsp;<BR> A few hours after release from the police station, Karen contacted her &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*87]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  employer and also her former supervisor, co-author Lai. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immediate task was for the victims to undergo medical evaluation and treatment. On the evening of April 30, 2006, the six of them met with co-author Lai to discuss the incident - and only then did the parties realize that they been beaten by the police for no reason, that they had been charged with crimes, and that their arraignment was scheduled for the following morning in Quincy District Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Huang case, this incident took place at a volatile time - in the context of a nationwide conversation about legalizing an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants. In fact, the incident occurred the morning before &quot;The Great American Strike 2006,&quot; when advocates called for all immigrants to boycott work and commerce in order to demonstrate the economic impact of immigrant communities in the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given this backdrop, the police officer's words to Joanna - &quot;Go back to Somerville&quot; - indicate that anti-immigrant sentiments played a role in the police's treatment of the Quincy 4 that evening. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the arraignment on May 1, 2006, the defendants had hoped that the prosecutor would drop the charges, as they believed they had done no wrong. If the police intended to teach them a lesson for talking back, it seemed that the pepper spray, physical battery, and four-hour detention had been more than sufficient. Besides, none of the defendants had criminal records, and the charges here were minor. No pre-trial disposition, however, was forthcoming. The case was scheduled for a pre-trial hearing on June 27, 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It became clear after the arraignment that this case was not simply about the liberties of four individuals. It was a case to challenge anti-Asian violence, to combat anti-immigrant sentiments, and to test the ideals of equality under the law. The question for us became how we could arouse the sleeping giant that was the growing Asian American population in Quincy. We faced two immediate tasks: securing counsel for all the defendants, n61a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>nd</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> establishing a Support Committee to coordinate the campaign. A third, loftier goal was to organize the community to secure justice. The first task proved far easier to accomplish than the other two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*88]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Community Meeting<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Within a week of the incident, the core group that included co-author Lai and key Chinese Progressive Association personnel had met with the group of six to understand the facts of the case and to explore the legal terrain of both the criminal prosecution and possible civil claims against the police. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group also discussed filing civilian complaints against the police and developing a media strategy. Although Karen suffered personal and physical injury, she made it clear from the onset that her battle went beyond personal vindication. At the May Day Rally at the Boston Commons, she stated, &quot;If this can happen to me, imagine how much more likely that this can happen to other immigrants who do not speak English!&quot; In that spirit, the organizing and community mobilization began. But unlike Karen, who had been active in the community for a decade, the other five victims did not choose to be activists. They wanted only justice. As Quan put it, &quot;How can they take away my freedom just like that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The location of the first community meeting on the Quincy 4 case was critical. There were discussions about holding the meeting in Boston Chinatown where we enjoyed a base of supporters from years of community organizing. This was dismissed in favor of a location in Quincy, even though organizers knew they were entering uncharted territory without a robust support base. The Support Committee made this decision for several reasons. First, the incident took place in Quincy, and if we sought to activate the Quincy Asian American community, we needed to be on their &quot;turf.&quot; Second, if we wanted to explore how many people of color had experienced similar incidents in Quincy, and if we wanted to build a coalition across racial and ethnic lines, we needed to step beyond our Chinatown comfort zone and work with other potential constituents and organizations. Finally, as Asians were a racial minority in Quincy, the Asian American community had to begin to assert itself by collectively organizing and maintaining a physical presence in Quincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial contacts with Asian American social service organizations in Quincy proved lukewarm. These organizations were reluctant to lend either space or support to the Support Committee. Potential reasons for this situation will be explored later. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end, the Support Committee found an initial organizing space in a Chinese church in Quincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Filling the Courtroom<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Between the arraignment on May 1, 2006 and the trial that &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*89]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  commenced on June 18, 2007, five pre-trials took place. The Quincy 4 Support Committee made it a priority to organize large crowds of people to attend these hearings. The purpose of these court attendances was twofold. First, the Committee wanted to ensure that the defendants felt supported. Second, the Committee wanted to demonstrate to the court and city officials that the community was concerned about this case and was watching it closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first pre-trial hearing occurred on June 26, 2006, two days after a rally was held in front of Quincy City Hall, calling for the District Attorney's office to drop the charges. Approximately seventy people attended this hearing, including members of the Quincy Human Rights Commission. As this was a pre-trial hearing, the case was scheduled simultaneously with at least twenty other cases. The courtroom was too small to accommodate all the community observers, and most stood, filling the back and sides of the room. The court personnel, surprised by the overwhelming interest, suggested that a larger courtroom be used for the next hearing. When the second pre-trial hearing took place on July 26, 2006, an estimated 120 people attended. Many could not secure standing room and had to wait outside. Because it was time-consuming to usher in and locate space for the participants - many of them elderly - court personnel began to show resentment toward the community members. The judge admonished the crowd for making noise, and others in the courtroom made snide remarks about our presence. When yet another pre-trial hearing was set, some attendees, including members of the Chinese press, began to doubt the effectiveness of the organized court attendances. To allay these doubts, the co-authors debriefed the community members on what had occurred at the end of every hearing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in order to educate the community not only about the case, but also more generally about the American criminal justice system. By comparing the disposition of other cases before the court and the Quincy 4 case, these debriefings also allowed community members to judge for themselves the injustice of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the case continued well into the winter, thirty to fifty members of the community consistently attended the next three pre-trial hearings. The attendees included members of the Chinese American community, as well as students, professors, labor organizers, clergy, workers, politicians, candidates for political office, teachers, supporters of the Somerville 5 case, and activists of all stripes spanning racial and ethnic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Rallies and Petitions<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Over the course of the Quincy 4 case, the Support Committee organized two rallies in Quincy. Public rallies were a central component of the Support Committee's strategy; they signified unity of purpose not just &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*90]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  regarding the Quincy 4 case, but also in the cause against police brutality. For instance, we invited members of the Somerville 5 to speak at one rally. These rallies also facilitated outreach to other communities or groups whose members learned of the case and attended to show their support. One group, Militant Labor, attended our first rally in June of 2006 and remained as a consistent presence throughout the case. In addition to attending all court hearings and public events and reporting the case in its international newspaper, Militant Labor was instrumental in connecting the issues of immigrant rights and police brutality through its newspaper and its monthly forum held in Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to promoting outreach, rallies also served as venues to educate people about the facts of the case. Because of the pendency of the criminal prosecution, the defendants were under their counsel's advice not to speak publicly about the case. As a result, tension developed between the public's desire to hear from the defendants and the defendants' need for protection in the legal proceedings. The compromise solution of having members of the Support Committee speak on their behalf was less than ideal since the news media preferred first-hand information. Some community members also wondered whether the defendants had something to hide. As the case proceeded to trial, the decision to protect the defendants from public exposure proved to be prudent. The prosecution subpoenaed the Chinese Progressive Association's Executive Director as a witness, seeking to introduce into evidence flyers that the Support Committee had distributed and e-mail messages obtained in order to attribute statements to the defendants for impeachment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second rally took place in front of the Quincy City Hall around noon on a weekday following the second pre-trial hearing. 120 attendees at this hearing marched from the courthouse to City Hall. The protest was highly visible to passersby, since the site had heavy automobile traffic and was near a subway stop. This was probably the first instance in which an Asian American group made a public impact in Quincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to holding rallies and protests, the Support Committee also circulated petitions with seven demands, including the dismissal of all criminal charges against the Quincy 4. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The petitions allowed those who could not attend court hearings to show their support. The Quincy 4 Support Committee gathered over 1,000 signatures urging the Mayor of Quincy, the Quincy Police Chief, and the Norfolk District Attorney to exonerate the victims and to investigate the police misconduct. Although these actions helped boost the spirits of the four defendants, they ultimately &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*91]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  did not change the outcome of the criminal case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Reaching Out to Politicians and Public Officials<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Experience has taught us that a successful campaign must carry both &quot;sticks and carrots.&quot; While petitions, protests, rallies, and court-packing could be interpreted as &quot;sticks,&quot; meetings with city officials would be &quot;carrots,&quot; representing our desire to reconcile and find an acceptable disposition. We wanted to first connect with members of the Quincy Human Rights Commission, some of whom attended the first community meeting at the church. These members invited Support Committee members to attend a Commission meeting. Although the Commission did not have jurisdiction to deal with the case, it was reassuring to know that there were people in Quincy who cared about Asian American residents and about the defendants' mistreatment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the pre-trial hearing on July 26, 2006, the Support Committee had notified the Mayor's office about the post-hearing rally and asked to meet with the Mayor. By that point, the Support Committee had collected over 1,000 petitions and letters asking the City to drop the charges and to investigate police misconduct. The Support Committee decided to pressure the Mayor regarding the demands and to find out more about a report stating that the City had referred Karen and Joanna's civilian complaints to an outside law enforcement agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the march, seventy-five protesters entered Quincy City Hall and asked to meet with the Mayor. On seeing the crowd, the Mayor's receptionist indicated that only one person from the group might see the Mayor. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within seconds, five to six Quincy police officers appeared in the lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This encounter with the receptionist was problematic on many fronts. First, her abrasive attitude may reflect the way city gate-keepers interact with the public. It is little wonder that Asian Americans rarely set foot in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*92]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City Hall. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, her demand that only one person meet with the Mayor forced us to choose a single representative, which contradicted the Support Committee's non-hierarchical organizing principle. We wanted all supporters to participate in any such meeting. After a quick consultation, we decided that the co-authors would go to the Mayor's office as intermediaries, bringing along the Chinese press. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The co-authors informed the Mayor that many other community members were waiting to speak with him but were barred by the receptionist. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayor instructed his assistant to invite all supporters to his office. To the fifty to sixty supporters, the Mayor explained that he could not discuss the case itself, but that he had referred the civilian complaints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that the Department of Justice would investigate. Some supporters questioned the impartiality of such an investigation and reiterated the Committee's demand for an open and public investigation, while others raised the prospect of a civilian review board to investigate police misconduct. The Mayor dismissed these ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the meetings with the Human Rights Commission and the Mayor produced no breakthroughs, they were positive events. These meetings brought the supporters to the table for once and held elected officials accountable to the entire community, especially those portions not proficient in English. Despite having to climb three flights of stairs, everyone, including many elderly supporters, drew energy from this small but significant victory. The experience of sitting across the table from the Mayor and questioning him was inherently empowering for community members. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Quincy 4 were also empowered by their ability to tell their story to the Quincy Human Rights Commission. On this front, the Support Committee surely remained true to democratic organizing values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. Mobilization of Community and Its Challenges<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Although the Chinese Progressive Association has hundreds of members who live in Quincy, it does not have an office or an established base in the city. Recognizing that outsiders, no matter how well intentioned, cannot just parachute into the community and dictate action, the small, ad hoc committee comprising of co-author Lai and Lydia Lowe of the Chinese Progressive Association solicited community leaders for support. By doing so, the committee hoped to educate them about the Quincy 4 case before rumors obscured the truth in the community, and to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*93]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  solicit their sponsorship of a community meeting in Quincy. The initial response was interesting. One community leader suggested postponing the community meeting until after a meeting with community leaders could take place. His ostensible concern was that in order to achieve a high turnout for the community meeting, community leaders must first be convinced to support the event. The ad hoc committee interpreted this as a retreat to back door dealings between &quot;leaders&quot; and politicians, which was not our model of community empowerment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another community leader who supported the meeting believed that this incident could not be swept under the rug. He felt that while it was important to respect community leaders, the community voice was important. With their lukewarm blessing, the committee set out to organize the community meeting in Quincy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Internal Quincy Challenges<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The community meeting of May 21, 2006 gave the Quincy 4 Support Committee its first taste of organizing in Quincy. The Chinese Progressive Association staff phone banked its Quincy members to ask them to attend the meeting. Some members questioned the defendants' integrity, whereas others felt sympathy for the victims and indignation at the violence perpetrated on fellow Asian Americans. Most telling was the debate over Chinese wording in the flyer among CPA staff before the meeting. Some felt that the term &quot;police brutality&quot; (that is, its Chinese equivalent) was too inflammatory because not all police officers were bad. Other community leaders in Quincy found the initial flyer, which summarized the facts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and presented the seven demands, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> too polarizing. Still another community leader felt that the predominant representation of Chinese Americans on the Support Committee was problematic and would be seen as pitting the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*94]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese against the Quincy police. Most doubted that the Asian American community or the Quincy community at large would be ready to support the defendants at the community meeting. Given the time sensitive-nature of criminal proceedings, the Committee chose to proceed with the meeting and to map out future plans based on the community's reaction at the meeting. To alleviate concerns about Chinese wording on the flyer, the Committee used a relevant Chinese newspaper article with a caption for the notice of the community meeting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the outreach process, volunteers distributed hundreds of flyers at the North Quincy and Wollaston subway stations. Many people began telling volunteers about their own experiences with the Quincy police. These stories recounted conduct ranging from discourtesy and threats to abuse of authority and use of excessive force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the community meeting on May 21, 2006, organizers prepared the room for about 100 people. People began to arrive half an hour beforehand. It took only a few minutes for the seats to fill up. When the meeting began, there was a standing-room-only crowd of 140 people. Before the meeting, co-author Lai spoke to a few attendees. Two middle-aged Chinese men took the few minutes before their restaurant shifts to attend because they felt they had waited long enough for someone to expose Quincy police misconduct. They relayed how some Quincy police officers, in uniforms or in plain clothes, often showed up at their restaurants around closing hour, then ate and drank without paying. One man recalled the community's response to the Huang case and felt strongly that the community had to be organized to tackle the current case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attendees of the meeting represented a wide spectrum of supporters, including Quincy residents; the Executive Secretary of the Mayor of Quincy; representatives from the Quincy Human Rights Commission, the Massachusetts Alliance of Portuguese Speakers, and various unions and immigrant groups; others who had worked with Karen on campaigns, and still other concerned citizens, including many Whites. The community meeting's goals were three-fold: (1) to inform the community about the Quincy 4 incident, (2) to hear from the community about similar incidents involving the Quincy Police, and (3) to rally the community around the goals set forth by the Support Committee. By a show of hands, a majority of those in attendance supported the seven demands. The sheer number of attendees at the meeting, and the enthusiasm expressed by some attendees to join task-oriented sub-committees, belied the community leaders' prior perception of Quincy as apathetic and unready to push for changes. The Support Committee hoped to build on this momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*95]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Lack of Participation from Asian Americans in the Struggle<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The timing of this case could not have been worse. The main (if not only) organizing capacity in the Asian American community rested with the Chinese Progressive Association, which was on its last leg of a campaign to buy office space on the hard-fought Parcel C. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n78At</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this time the CPA was planning its office relocation and raising funds for the building; moreover, key personnel were on summer vacation. Hence, organizing capacity was vastly diminished. Even worse, CPA's lead organizer was Karen who, as a defendant in this case, was in many ways hampered in her efforts to lead the organizing. Still, absent other organizing resources, Karen continued to play a role in organizing, both within the defendant group and within the community. Meanwhile, some community leaders, rather than support the struggle for justice, undermined the defendants' cause by challenging their claims based on the police's report. While the case was pending, another racial incident occurred in Quincy involving Asian American middle school students who were tied to a schoolyard fence and stoned by white students. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Community leaders who knew of the incident refused to share information with the Quincy 4 Support Committee, claiming that the incident was merely one of &quot;bad kids&quot; misbehaving rather than racial in nature. The leaders did not believe that the middle school incident was linked to the Quincy 4 case, or that both incidents reflected an underlying problem of anti-Asian hostility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To situate the Quincy 4 case within a long history of anti-Asian violence, the Support Committee screened a made-for-television documentary, produced in the late 1980s, entitled &quot;Violence Against Asians.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The film depicted a surge of anti-Asian violence in Massachusetts throughout the 1980s, highlighting the Huang case in Boston Chinatown as well as incidents in Chelsea, Revere, and Quincy. The screening was intended to inform a generation that was too young to have known of these events at the time, to portray anti-Asian violence as a theme linking the past to the present, and to energize younger activists in training. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About thirty people attended the screening and discussion. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*96]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, the enthusiasm following the May 2006 community meeting and screening proved short-lived. One community meeting attendee, a religious leader in Quincy, decided based on his own research that the police action was justified. In the week after the meeting, he sent out a lengthy e-mail enumerating his analysis, alleging factual errors, and asked to be removed from the listserv. Many others who signed up to join the sub-committees did not follow through. By the end of the summer, the Support Committee had no more support than it had at the outset of the case. Other young Asian American activists who had showed initial enthusiasm now attended events sporadically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&quot;Let's Not Make Waves!&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Both the &quot;blame-the-victim&quot; mentality and the lack of follow-through may be attributed to a cultural reluctance to &quot;make waves.&quot; This attitude, like anti-Asian violence in Quincy, has a long history. According to the 1989 Patriot Ledger report, Asian American victims often sought only an apology from their perpetrators, rather than invoking the law to hold them accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August of 1988, a fight erupted between Vietnamese refugees and white youths at the Welcome Young Playground, resulting in the hospitalization of three white and three Vietnamese youths. By October, four Vietnamese youths and two white youths involved were charged with assault and battery; no civil rights complaints were filed. A month later, the presiding judge at the Quincy District Court found the Vietnamese defendants not guilty. Subsequently, the Vietnamese youths decided to drop all charges against the white defendants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the Vietnamese youths, Kim Dang, who was hit by a rock, stated, &quot;I didn't care about a conviction. All I want is to change their understanding. I want to ask them, &quot;Why don't you like me?' Afterward, the kid said thank you and we shake hands. I felt like something was released - something really heavy. All I want is to walk down the street and be able to play in the playground. That's freedom.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Lee, a 16-year-old eleventh grader, was passing through a turnstile at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (&quot;MBTA&quot;) subway station when a toll collector, believing that he had evaded payment, chased him and yelled derogatory remarks. As Lee recalled, the man had yelled: &quot;I should send you back to your rice paddies; you ruined our lives in Vietnam.&quot; The collector detained Sam and locked him in the tollbooth for forty-five minutes. At a departmental hearing, the MBTA determined that the collector had erred and should be fired. Sam's mother agreed with the dismissal and refused to press charges against the MBTA. She &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*97]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reasoned, &quot;If I go to court, they will make a record for the collector ... . I don't want to punish the man.&quot; She only wanted the MBTA to publish an apology in the newspaper, and to print fare signs in Quincy in Chinese. Sam himself preferred a harsher punishment: &quot;That's not enough ... .. I'm not mad at what he called me, I'm mad he touched me. The guy's like 6-feet tall.&quot; Sam's friends were also surprised that he did not take the perpetrator to court: &quot;They say, &quot;How can you let him do that to you?'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Asian Americans, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> like Sam's mother, have tended to downplay incidents of discrimination and racism and to allow perpetrators to get away with lesser punishments. Some are motivated by fear of retaliation. This fear, combined with the common self-perception of first-generation immigrants or refugees as not &quot;full Americans,&quot; might explain the prevailing tendency among Asian Americans to &quot;just let it go.&quot; The Sam Lee case reflects a contrasting mentality among second-generation Asian Americans who acculturate to a different sensibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our experience in the Quincy 4 case indicates that the first-generation attitudes persist. Because Asian Americans remain a minority in Quincy, fear of retaliation is legitimate. After a post-verdict community meeting in Quincy, co-author Leong, while driving in Quincy in the late afternoon, received racial taunts from white drivers and pedestrians on three occasions. Another Support Committee member, on coming from the MBTA station to the same community meeting, was ignored by several individuals whom she asked for directions, and then was called &quot;chink&quot; as she exited the station. The Quincy 4, and Karen in particular, defied the prevailing &quot;let's not make waves&quot; mentality by refusing to let the incident dissipate through the passage of time. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Lack of Civil Rights Within the Asian American Community<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As soon as the Quincy 4 incident hit the news, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rumors abounded. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*98]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some assumed that the defendants must have been culpable because they were out at midnight. Many also reflected a heavy presumption that the police action was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the name of the Support Committee was debated. Some suggested &quot;Quincy 6,&quot; since six Asian Americans were involved. In the end, to avoid confusion, we settled on &quot;Quincy 4&quot; to reflect the number of defendants formally charged. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The use of Quincy 4 was intentional, meant to build solidarity with other minority victims of police brutality and racism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such name association would allow for easy identification as an incident involving the police, and signified multi-racial and multi-ethnic solidarity. However, not everyone agreed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Assumptions of Guilt and Trust in Authority<BR>&nbsp;<BR> At the May 2006 community meeting, a young Asian American man voiced the view that the defendants had to prove their innocence. He &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*99]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  questioned the presence of the six individuals on the roadside during early morning hours and doubted that police would have used pepper spray or tackled them unless they had engaged in illegal behavior. Bespeaking faith in the police, he expressed incredulity at the notion that the officer could have pepper sprayed the victims without provocation and that three officers would then tackle Karen to the ground for no reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Interplay Between the Model Minority Myth and Asian Americans' Inability to Recognize Racism<BR>&nbsp;<BR> During the fourteen months between arrest and verdict, the co-authors and other activists visited college campuses and talked to Asian American students about the case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of these gatherings were small and predominantly comprised women. Unfortunately, these gatherings did not arouse collective outrage. There were certainly expressions of concern about Karen and questions about the criminal proceedings and the potential for civil claims. However, these events failed to arouse the students to connect the Quincy 4 case with broader challenges of anti-immigrant attitudes, anti-Asian violence, and racial tension, or to inspire campus activism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lack of response perhaps reflects acquiescence to the model minority myth enshrouding Asian Americans. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistics show that Asian Americans, relative to other racial groups, have high household incomes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a high proportion of degree holders, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> high representation on selective &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*100]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  college campuses, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and high representation in management, professional and related occupations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These statistics, however, mask the diversity among Asian Americans and do not account for household size, education level, immigration history, and English-language proficiency. Nevertheless, Asian Americans have become the socially acceptable minority group, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having overcome challenges that persist for other groups, even without external assistance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asian Americans have been cast as a role model for other minority groups to emulate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given this placement on a pedestal, many Asian Americans cannot fathom the notion of anti-Asian sentiment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The implication, then, is that those who face the wrath of police, such as the Quincy 4, must deserve it due to individual misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Going Beyond Black and White: Asian Americans Have Civil Rights Too<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Quincy 4 originally faced difficulty in securing legal counsel for their criminal matters. Within a week of the incident, co-author Lai contacted the local Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, various criminal &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*101]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defense lawyers from the National Lawyers' Guild, and a criminal defense firm known for its challenges of police brutality. None followed up or offered referrals. The authors speculate that their inaction reflects failure to recognize the civil rights implications of the case and its significance to the Asian American community. The only civil rights group to offer assistance to the Support Committee was the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The established civil rights community may be slow to recognize that victims of civil rights violations are not always Black. This tendency is not surprising; most of the existing civil rights literature assumes a Black/White paradigm, mentioning Asian Americans in passing, if at all. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asian Americans share this tendency to forget that Asian Americans, too, have civil rights and that those rights are routinely violated. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the studies that discuss Asian Americans civil rights issues, most are authored by Asian Americans and published in Asian American-focused journals. This trend of civil rights issues in separate tracks is troubling; it tends to drive a wedge between different communities of color and fosters a &quot;zero-sum&quot; mentality, diminishing what should be a collective conversation into an argument over whose suffering has been greater. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anger that might be focused by a collective understanding of systemic injustice, and hence channeled into collective action toward racial justice for all, is instead squandered in internal bickering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VI. Examining the Media Coverage<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Long Guang Huang case and subsequent community organizing have demonstrated that media coverage can influence the outcome of a case'. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than fifty print media news reports featured the Quincy 4 case between May 2006 and July 2007; 70% of these appeared in the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*102]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese press. The case was also reported on various blogs and websites. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A majority of these online postings </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> consisted of information posted by the Support Committee on its listserv </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Quincy 4 websites. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No mainstream broadcast media covered the case, and only one Chinese-language cable access program covered the May 2006 community meeting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Exploring Coverage Between Chinese Press, the Militant and the Mainstream Press<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Coverage by mainstream English press and Chinese press differed significantly. Sampan, a bilingual community newspaper, first reported the incident. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sampan reporter was one of the few journalists who actually met Karen, interviewed her, and personally witnessed her black eye and bruises. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second account was reported by the World Journal, a Chinese newspaper with a worldwide circulation. It provided more details about the night of April 30, 2006 but lacked reference to an official police &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*103]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  report. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the major Chinese press attended the May 2006 community meeting, but no English-language media were present. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor did the mainstream English media cover the June 2006 rally. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only two mainstream English newspapers in the Boston region, the Boston Globe and the Patriot Ledger, covered the case; together they published fourteen reports on the Quincy 4. Beyond the Boston area, one other English-language newsweekly, the Militant, covered the case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the Support Committee's efforts to circulate details of Karen and Tat's physical injuries, none of the Ledger's nine news accounts mentioned harm sustained by the defendants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, in a parallel article on the July 2006 meeting with the Mayor, the Ledger included nearly the entire police report of the incident. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports filed during trial were also silent about Karen and Tat's injuries, even though the defense entered relevant photos into evidence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, in covering the trial, the Ledger did not indicate that Officer Curtis's testimony was contradicted by the other five officers who testified. Nor did it report on the racial composition of the jury, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*104]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  often a crucial factor in cases where race is an issue. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the Ledger, the Boston Globe took a more neutral, even sympathetic approach. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Globe did publish a long letter by a state trooper who suggested that the defendants and their supporters were un-American, and condemned the supporters for playing the race card. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, while the case was pending, the Globe gave front-page treatment to Quincy's public relations event - a police outreach to elder Chinese residents accompanied by a photograph of a roomful of elderly Chinese proudly displaying their certificates. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without any reference to the Quincy 4 case, the article failed to reveal that it was the tension between the Quincy police and the growing Asian American community that spurred such community outreach in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Militant's coverage provided a stark contrast to the mainstream English-language coverage. One reporter followed the case from June 2006 until the end. Unlike the Ledger, which depicted the Mayor's meeting with Quincy 4 supporters as conciliatory, the Militant reported the contentious meeting that actually took place. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such candid reports, however, had limited circulation because its readership remains small in number. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*105]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Compared to the English press coverage, the Chinese press coverage was more frequent and detailed. Because all three major Chinese-language newspapers were present at community meetings, rallies, and court hearings, the Chinese press coverage invariably contained more details about events, which gave readers a greater understanding of the proceedings. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Differences in Chinese and English-language press were particularly apparent during the trial. The reporter from the Chinese newspaper Sing Tao, covered the trial from start to finish, often arriving at the courthouse at the same time as the defendants and remaining until everyone had left. Her reports provided details that Ledger articles omitted, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including descriptions that undercut the officers' claims that they felt threatened during the encounter. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her reports also pointed out contradictions in Officer Curtis' testimony during cross-examination. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her foreboding about the lack of impact of key defense strategies, such as the introduction of the turret tape, photographs taken at the scene, and the booking sheets, captured the mood of those present though the trial. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further capturing the case's ultimate impact on the Asian American community at large, Sing Tao wrote on day five of the trial: &quot;police put fear in the people who will from now on be afraid to enter Quincy.&quot; Similar accounts of the trial were reported in other Chinese-language newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detailed Chinese press coverage enabled the readers to understand the injustice of the verdict and sentencing. One reader, in response to the articles, even showed up in front of the Quincy District Court to protest. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*106]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In contrast, readers who had access only to the English press believed that the three who were convicted deserved the harsh sentences, as evidenced by electronic messages sent to the Support Committee. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VII. The Trial Revisited<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The Quincy 4 case was decided by a jury of five Whites and one African American. The jury pool was drawn from Norfolk County, a larger geographic area than Quincy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the Support Committee were concerned that on the first day, there was not a single person of color in the jury pool. At the conclusion of jury selection on the second day, when one African American woman joined the jury, the Support Committee concluded that one person of color was better than none. This seeming imbalance is reminiscent of the 1854 California Supreme Court decision People v. Hall. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Jury Selection: Echoes of People v. Hall<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In People v. Hall, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the California Supreme Court nullified the testimonies of Chinese witnesses in an earlier conviction of a white defendant's murder of a Chinese man. As a matter of public policy, the Hall Court was concerned that &quot;the same rule which would admit [the Chinese] to testify, would admit them to all the equal rights of citizenship, and we might soon see them at the polls, in the jury box, upon the bench, and in our legislative halls.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court continued,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The anomalous spectacle of a distinct people [i.e. the Chinese], living in &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*107]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  our community, recognizing no laws of this State, except through necessity, bringing with them their prejudices and national feuds, in which they indulge in open violation of law; whose mendacity is proverbial; a race of people whom nature has marked as inferior, and who are incapable of progress or intellectual development beyond a certain point, as their history has shown; differing in language, opinions, color, and physical conformation; between whom and ourselves nature has placed an impassable difference, is now presented, and for them is claimed, not only the right to swear away the life of a [white] citizen, but the further privilege of participating with us in administering the affairs of our Government. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> More than 150 years since the Hall decision, the Quincy 4 case came down to weighing the veracity of one Chinese female witness against that of six white police officers. Furthermore, with the exception of the one African American juror in the Quincy 4 trial, the racial composition of the jury had not changed. The four Asian American defendants in this case were tried by a jury that did not reflect their racial diversity. This gives rise to questions of the degree to which racial stereotypes played a part in the police and prosecution's strategies, as well as in the jury deliberation room - and how such stereotypes might have impacted the outcome of this case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Strategies of Police and Prosecution<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The police reports and the officers' testimonies strongly suggested that the four defendants were aggressors who compelled Officer Curtis to use pepper spray and forcibly restrain Karen. For instance, Officer Curtis testified that he stood by the open car door, caught the door with his foot, and trapped Quan between the door and the car. Curtis then grabbed Quan's wrist and used the pepper spray in his face. Seconds later, as he was pulling Quan from behind the car door, he saw Karen leap in and hit her with his hip as she tried to grab Quan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the stand, Officer Curtis justified his use of force by claiming that he became fearful when Tat and Howard put up a &quot;fighter stance&quot; to challenge him. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Officer's claims invoked the stereotype that all Asians know kung fu and are thus dangerous even when unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*108]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Kuan Chung Kao and the Kung Fu Fighter Stereotype<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Asians have long been stereotyped as dangerous &quot;kung fu fighters&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who need to be restrained by police force. In 1997, in Rohnert Park, California, Kuan Chung Kao fell victim to this stereotype when he was shot in the chest by a deputy while waving a broomstick. The Sheriff's Department issued a press release to justify the police officer's action on the grounds that Kao was &quot;brandishing a stick in a threatening martial arts fashion.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This nine-page press release contained many references to martial arts, including a neighbor's claim that Kao had been spinning the stick &quot;in a manner consistent with a &quot;Ninja Fighter'&quot; and had been standing in a &quot;Samurai warrior-type stance.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The officers involved in the Quincy 4 incident, in a similar vein, described (in the police report and on the witness stand) the Quincy 4 as unreasonably dangerous, thus justifying their use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">i. Depictions of the Quincy 4 as Asian Kung Fu Fighters at Trial<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Quincy Police Officer Curtis wrote about the incident in the following manner:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>The males took positions on each side of Karen Chen. Karen Chen had Tat Yuen to her right and Howard Ng to her left. All three, Tat Yuen, Karen Chen and Howard Ng started to surge forward towards me. I was threatened by their actions and in fear of being attacked. I held up my pepper spray in my left hand and pointed it at Tat Yuen, Karen Chen, and Howard Ng ... . Tat Yuen had both fists clenched and up in front of him. His facial expressions were wild and angry. He got into a fighters [sic] stance, straight on and approached me. Karen Chen, with Tat Yuen at her side, was screaming, &quot;&quot;fuck you, you sprayed me!&quot;&quot; Karen Chen's facial expression was also wild and angry. She too approached me in a threatening manner. Howard Ng had both arms extended with his fists clenched. He also got into a fighters [sic] stance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Although portions of the above statement were inconsistent with Officer Curtis' report and testimony, as well as with the other officers' descriptions, all accounts depicted the defendants as wild-eyed kung fu fighters. Another common theme is the implicit notion that just one Asian fighter, even if hurt or incapacitated, can overcome numerous armed opponents:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>...Patrolman Wilbur and I completed handcuffing Karen Chen. Upon arrival of the ambulance that I had called, I escorted Karen Chen over to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*109]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the EMT's to have her treated for exposure to pepper spray. As I walked her over to the ambulance, Karen Chen continued to yell, swear and threaten to &quot;get me!' She was yelling to the others who were not under arrest to help her. Karen Chen was acting violently and she was very unpredictable. I felt that having her treated at this time was a physical risk to the ambulance personnel. The transport wagon was on scene. I told the EMT to respond to the police station cell block where they could treat Karen Chen more securely. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> During the trial, Officer Curtis repeated this description. Another officer agreed with Curtis in his report, explaining why it took three police officers to handcuff a petite Asian woman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>I then grabbed Chen by the arm and she went crazy, Chen began violently kicking and trying to punch me. Officer Curtis came over and grabbed Chen to assist me. Officer Curtis and myself brought Chen to the ground to immobilize her. Officer Curtis had gotten a handcuff on her right wrist and she pulled her arm away and locked her arms together in front of her body and began kicking towards us as she was on the ground. I placed my knee on her shoulder blade and attempted several times to break her grip without hurting her arm. Chen was actively resisting and we were still unable to break her grip on the handcuffs. Officer Mahoney came over to assist us as Chen violently struggled with us. Finally after several moments Officer Curtis managed to get her to release her grip and she was handcuffed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The over-dramatized depiction of the Quincy 4's supposed violent tendencies indicates a prosecutorial strategy to sell this &quot;kung fu fighter&quot; stereotype to a non-Asian jury. This stereotypical image served to justify the need for three police officers to take down Karen Chen, as she was only half cuffed - she might have used the metal handcuff as a weapon. Neither the police nor the prosecutor mentioned that Karen weighed under 100 pounds, stood just over five-feet tall, was untrained in martial arts, and that Curtis was more than twice her size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIII. The Verdict and the Aftermath: Silencing of the Asian American Community<BR>&nbsp;<BR> When the case was handed over to the jury on a Friday afternoon, we correctly feared that the defendants would fall victims to &quot;speedy justice.&quot; Around 3:30 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom to seek instructions on the many confusing statutory elements of each charge. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*110]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the verdict came in at 4:45 p.m., we were collectively relieved by Howard's acquittal. He was released and led from the courtroom. Supporters of the Quincy 4 were quickly stunned, however, by the convictions of the other three defendants. Quan was convicted on both charges, Karen of resisting arrest, and Tat of disorderly conduct. The court then moved to sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the Assistant District Attorney's recommendation of probation for all three defendants, the judge ordered ten days of jail time each for Quan and Tat, to begin immediately. Quan was handcuffed and whisked away by a court officer. When he came out of the room he held up his cuffed hands so the supporters in the hallway </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could witness the injustice. Tat followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days, in a criminal justice system that has issued far harsher punishments on other victims, is nothing. Yet given our knowledge of the Quincy 4's innocence, it was difficult to contemplate a guilty verdict, much less jail time. Furthermore, based on our legal knowledge of the typical sentence in similar cases, and witnessing the lenient disposition of other misdemeanor and simple felony cases in the same court by the same judge, most of us expected the usual probation and fines, as the Assistant District Attorney recommended. It was clear to us that by sentencing Quan and Tat to jail, the judge intended not only to punish these two, but also to punish and silence their supporters in attendance. If there was some logic behind the sentencing and the judge's use of discretion to exceed the prosecution's requests, it was not made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community had come full circle. Twenty years earlier, presiding Judge Albert Kramer of the Quincy District Court had encouraged Asian Americans to come forward as witnesses and participants in the judicial process. In commenting on why they should do so in hate crime cases, Judge Kramer said, &quot;[Asian Americans] find living with these things is far more dangerous than attempting to deal with it ... . [by not coming forward,] it sends a message that attacking them is fine because you won't get caught.&quot; Suggesting that Asian Americans can play a role in securing strict court sentences, he added, &quot;If you come to court, we have to show you the experience is worth the risk.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, the Asian American community was more than highly visible. The Quincy 4 supporters came out en masse, made themselves visible in protests and rallies, and attended the trial and hearings religiously. These were not the docile, unassuming Asian Americans to which Quincy's white inhabitants were accustomed. The harsh sentences given to the Quincy 4 &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*111]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  might be viewed as a statement by the court to future Asian American litigants: do not waste the court's time with a trivial case; take the plea bargain or take a settlement; if you do not cooperate and you are unlucky enough to come before me for sentencing, be forewarned. The harsh sentences were deterrents for future defendants seeking justice through the criminal process. As with the initial criminal matter in the Vincent Chin case, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Quincy court seemed primarily concerned with the administrative efficiency of its docket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Attempt to Tell Our Story Through a Public Letter: Fiasco with the Quincy Sun<BR>&nbsp;<BR> One post-trial resolution adopted by the Quincy 4 Support Committee was to publish a letter in the mainstream media to voice our outrage regarding the case's outcome. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only news outlet in which the Support Committee could afford to publish was a local newspaper that circulated within Quincy. The letter, to be published as an advertisement, read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>For fourteen months, we have supported four Asian Americans (Karen Chen, Howard Ng, Quan Thin and Tat Yuen) in their quest to clear their names after being pepper-sprayed and beaten up by several Quincy police officers and then prosecuted for crimes that they insisted they did not commit.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>On June 22, 2007, after a five-day trial, the jury cleared the charge against Howard Ng, but found the other three guilty of either disorderly conduct, or resisting arrest, or both. We disagree with the guilty verdicts returned by the jury. The four remain adamant that they were falsely charged after being victims of police brutality in the early hours of April 30, 2006.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>We are outraged by the disproportionately harsh sentences that Judge Orfanello handed down. Judge Orfanello issued sentences that far exceeded the prosecutor's recommendation, which did not include any jail time for anyone. Despite the fact that Thin and Yuen have no prior criminal records, Judge Orfanello ordered their immediate incarceration to serve 10 days of the six-month suspended sentence and two years' probation for resisting arrest and/or disorderly conduct. They were not even allowed a moment to speak to their family members who were waiting in court. Likewise, Judge Orfanello placed Chen under a lengthy 18-month probation for her first conviction. In delivering the above sentences, Judge Orfanello provided no basis or reasoning to support such harsh punishment that did not fit the crimes alleged. We see this as a punishment of these individuals for exercising their constitutional right to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*112]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  have their day in court.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>We stand by these four individuals in their proclamation of their innocence and we demand no retaliation against them or their families, or any others in the Asian American community, for standing up for their rights. We will not tolerate any unfair treatment toward any Asian Americans.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The morning after the Support Committee placed the advertisement, co-author Lai received a call from the paper's advertising sales agent, who asked that the Support Committee omit &quot;being pepper sprayed and beaten by&quot; because, according to her, this was inconsistent with the police reports. The sales agent further asked that the CPA be listed as the entity that paid for the advertisement complete with its contact information, since CPA was the source of the check used to pay for the advertisement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Co-author Lai pointed out that the police report was only one version of the account and that the police officer himself testified in court that he had used pepper spray and physical force. The sales agent then claimed that the individuals were pepper sprayed only after they attacked the police, and that the newspaper's legal counsel strongly suggested removal of those references. She also insisted that the entity placing the advertisement was legally required to list its full identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-author Lai protested, defending the accuracy of her version of the incident and explaining that the advertisement was paid for by the Quincy 4 Support Committee, with the Chinese Progressive Association acting as its fiscal agent. Ultimately unwilling to publish an advertisement with censored content, the Support Committee withdrew the placement. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This censorship attempt itself was troubling. Even more troubling was the fact that this small newspaper went to the trouble of studying the police reports &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*113]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and seeking clearance with its lawyer within twenty-four hours of receiving the placement; this suggested that the Quincy 4 incident was far more significant to the City than the level of mainstream media exposure suggested. Regardless, the controversial nature of the case revealed the latent tensions between Quincy's Asian American and white residents. It also suggested that Asian American residents who claimed otherwise were deluding themselves. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n155</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Would the Verdict be Different Had We Not Organized?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The proper question is whether we were right to organize around the case at all. We believe the answer is an unconditional &quot;yes,&quot; stemming from lessons learned from our collective history as Asian Americans fighting injustice. Discrimination inherent in law does not disappear simply because legal or political decision makers suddenly realize what is right and fair. Legal changes entail the exercise of advocacy skills: litigation, lobbying, organizing, and education. To overlook the need for such activism is to remain mentally locked, hoping for the best while doing nothing to work toward progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another question to ask is whether the sentences would have been more lenient if the community had not organized. The answer here is &quot;yes.&quot; Based on our collective legal experience, we have surmised that the court prioritizes efficiency. Therefore, had the defendants apologized to the officers who brutalized them and signed away their claims, the case would have been resolved. The defendants rejected this compromise, however, based on their conviction that they had done no wrong and owed no apology. Admitting guilt would have been easier for the individual victims, but not necessarily better for the collective good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*114]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What if Yick Wo </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n156</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had not sued the City of San Francisco? What if Rosa Parks had simply moved to the back of the bus? Progress is incompatible with &quot;the easy way out.&quot; And if one were concerned about being convicted and having a criminal record, the Quincy 4 would have role models in Fred Korematsu, Min Yasui, and Gordon Hirabayashi to follow. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n157</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IX. Lessons for the Asian American Community in Organizing for Change<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As previously discussed, the Quincy 4 case occurred at an inopportune moment. Various circumstances conspired to create a vacuum of leadership from the community in the Support Committee. Co-author Lai took it upon herself to chair the Support Committee during the summer of 2006, coordinating the campaign until the CPA and others could take over. Throughout the campaign, the Support Committee had a fluid membership, with CPA personnel becoming de facto campaign staffers. This decentralized structure made it difficult to map out strategies or to make decisions. Unlike the organizers in the Long Guang Huang case, who rallied supporters from across the political spectrum by depicting the incident as an attack on all Asian Americans, the Quincy 4 Support Committee failed to convey that message. In this case, there was no unity among Asian American constituencies, nor any agreement within the Support Committee on broader systemic issues that should be challenged. As a result, the Support Committee became a task-oriented operation focused only on planning rallies and court hearings; the campaign lacked any full strategy discussion or contingency plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Mobilizing Groups<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Throughout the Quincy 4 case, the Support Committee used a variety of methods: old-fashioned literature drops, notices in organizational newsletters, and phone banking; as well as mass e-mails, websites, and blogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial goal of the campaign was to challenge inequality and racial discrimination in Quincy. Another goal of the outreach was to build a cross-racial and ethnic coalition focusing on misuse of police authority and to demand better accountability and racial justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*115]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Essentially, four groups were consistently present during the yearlong ordeal, most notably a group of elderly Chinese immigrants, based in Chinatown, who knew Karen and had a long history of working with the CPA - namely in struggles for community preservation, tenant rights, immigrant rights, worker rights, and voting rights. More importantly, these Chinatown-based supporters understood the history of discrimination, knew of the Long Guang Huang case, and readily perceived the Quincy 4 case as yet another incident of anti-Asian racism. Hoping that the American legal system would dispense justice for the four victims, these supporters maintained a strong courtroom presence throughout the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other consistently supportive community partners included lawyers from Greater Boston Legal Services, organizers from the Center to Support Immigrant Organizing, members of the Institute for Asian American Studies and the Asian American Resource Workshop, and various labor groups and organizers. As part of the local social justice network, these groups were naturally invested in the case's outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Support Committee made a special concerted effort to reach out to Asian American youth - from high school students to young professionals - through e-mail listservs, websites, and blogs. Involving this constituency was crucial because its members represented the future of the progressive movement, and because the issue of police harassment of young people of color should resonate most strongly with them. However, this demographic proved to be the most skeptical and least engaged in the cause. Aside from those college students affiliated with the CPA youth program and the Coalition of Asian Pacific American Youth, including a handful who drove through the night to attend the court hearing in the morning, most local college students were apathetic. The young people became more active after the verdict; they began attending Support Committee meetings, helping to develop the agenda, facilitating small group discussions, and participating in long-term strategy discussions. But even then, the enthusiasm was short-lived; it lasted only through the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Quincy 4 case drew additional support from groups beyond the Asian American community - most notably from the supporters of the Somerville 5. Also, candidates for state and local offices made brief shows of support during the ordeal. Their numbers were small, but their presence was noted in media coverage of the case. Representatives from Militant Labor also participated. Various individuals who learned of the case through e-mail or by word of mouth also lent support, including a Catholic nun from Quincy who heard about the case through the Support Committee's outreach for the May 2006 community event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably absent from this support network were community leaders from the Quincy Asian American community, mainstream civil rights organizations, Chinatown social service organizations, and Asian American &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*116]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  politicians. Their absence cannot be explained by ignorance of the case or inadequacy of notice; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n158</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> many voiced opinions about organizing or legal defense after the verdict. Indeed, the absence of these groups during crucial moments of the struggle made their post hoc offers to help appear self-serving and hollow. The lack of support from these mainstream groups suggests that perhaps civil rights is still viewed as a Black and White issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Use of Internet: Its Limitation as an Outreach Strategy<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Much more so than in the case involving Long Guang Huang, information technology played a key role in outreach and organizing around the Quincy 4 case. However, the core supporters of the Quincy 4 turned out to be the elderly, whom the Support Committee organized through old-fashioned phone banking. Though notifications about the rally and court hearing were sent to hundreds of listserv recipients, overall, outreach to young Asian Americans by electronic means was not particularly effective. Young Asian Americans were far less consistent in event attendance and overall support than were older supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Lack of Asian Americans Serving Jury Duty<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As experienced legal services attorneys, the authors have helped numerous Asian immigrants seek waivers from jury duty service based on limited English-language proficiency. However, Norfolk County, which encompasses Quincy, is home to many Asians who are not limited in English proficiency. Norfolk includes more than 50,000 persons of Asian descent who collectively represent 7.7% of the county's population. Given these statistics, the utter lack of Asians in the jury pool of thirty-seven for this case was suspect. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n159</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many immigrants wish to be naturalized so they can enjoy the full rights of citizenship. The desire to sponsor their families may be pertinent for most, but we have also encouraged many immigrants to become citizens in order to &quot;get out the (Asian) vote,&quot; and even urged citizen members of our community to run for public office. Yet, we at times had forgotten to remind these prospective American citizens that full political participation includes jury duty. Recognizing that Asian immigrants are often intimidated by the language barrier, we must develop a national initiative for Asian America that embraces jury duty as a component of civic participation. We must keep in mind the Hall court's racist language &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*117]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a call to full political engagement by Asian Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Realities That We Cannot Overcome<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In previous organizing attempts - i.e., around land use, voting rights, immigrant rights, tenants' rights, and workers' rights - filing suit, or threatening to do so, was a tool of last resort, which the community could invoke upon exhaustion of other conflict resolution channels. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n160</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Quincy 4 case, not only was the lawsuit filed at the onset of organizing, but it was also a criminal prosecution that proceeded swiftly and held the potential of great detriment to those involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the community's previous experiences organizing around Long Guang Huang, gathering support for the Quincy 4 presented novel challenges. First, there were no third-party non-Asian witnesses to the incident </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n161</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who could corroborate the Quincy 4's account; this situation pit the police's version against that of the defendants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n162</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, being young Asian Americans, the victims did not necessarily evoke as sympathetic an image as the elderly Mr. Huang did.. Third, Karen's position as a CPA organizer worked against her. Within the Asian American community, this affiliation turned away some who felt that CPA was too radical in its approach (even though it had won many campaigns for workers, tenants, and voters in the Chinatown community). Beyond Asian American and progressive communities, Karen's work as an organizer could be perceived as troublemaking. Such perceptions led some to believe that she had either provoked the attack or played the race card to malign the City of Quincy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n163</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the Quincy Asian American community and the City of Quincy were not ready to tackle the issue of local racial tensions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n164</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*118]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite our determination not to let litigation drive community organizing, the Quincy Asian American community needed a moral victory in the criminal case before attempting to address more fundamental issues. However, the drawn-out process eventually sapped the community's optimism and, as a result, the Quincy Asian American community settled back in where it began - sitting on the sidelines, waiting for lawyers to deliver results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Trying to Serve Two Masters: Community Versus Defendant Interests<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On many occasions, the interests of individual members of the Quincy 4 differed and even clashed with those of the Asian American community as a whole. For example, although many community members supported the Quincy 4, many others doubted their innocence. To the extent that the latter questioned the Quincy 4's intent in pursuing the case and even their truthfulness, it would have been easier for members of the Quincy 4 to &quot;take a deal&quot; with the prosecution rather than face public scrutiny. A principal goal of the Support Committee was to balance these two interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To protect their own interests, the Quincy 4 defendants retained separate lawyers, each of whom was charged with promoting his or her client's best interest. As a result, the defense team collectively had little interest in the community's stake. Yet, in the Support Committee's perspective, this case had to be approached from both an individual and a community front. The defendants met with their respective lawyers, but these meetings were usually preceded or followed by discussion, debriefing, or strategizing amongst the Quincy 4 and a subset of the Support Committee. Further, the co-authors often explained legal processes and the impact of various strategies to the defendants, reviewing court documents with them and preparing them with trial scenarios when they could not meet with their lawyers. Through these group sessions, the Quincy 4 tried to reach common understandings as to the next steps in collective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Support Committee's task of balancing the community's and the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*119]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendants' individual interests was difficult. In cases of conflicting interests, we usually decided in favor of the individuals who faced potential conviction. In turn, defendants had to consider the actions and strategies according to their own personal beliefs on what would be best for them individually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One particular instance aptly exemplifies this conflict. The day after the convictions were handed down, a scheduled event to commemorate Vincent Chin's death occurred; clips of &quot;Who Killed Vincent Chin?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n165</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were shown and key parts interpreted to a packed room consisting primarily of Chinese-speaking audience. Dismay at the Quincy 4 outcome, combined with outrage at the injustices of the Chin case, led to discussions about holding a protest in front of the courthouse to demonstrate to the judge that, though she might incarcerate individual Asian American defendants, she could not silence the Asian American community. The Chinese press were present and published this announcement in the newspapers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n166</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, we were forced to cancel this protest out of concern for the safety of Quan and Tat, who remained in jail. Their families were concerned that the protest may cause the court to punish them further by increasing their sentences. Apparent ties between the police and correctional facility personnel contributed to the fear that Quan and Tat would be mistreated. Since we had no means of directly contacting Quan or Tat, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n167</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> we had no idea whether they would favor such a protest. Thus, we decided to postpone the protest to assuage their families' fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this situation, serving the immediate needs of Quan and Tat did not serve those of the community. Clearly, the Asian American community was silenced by the convictions and the sentences, and they desired a quick outlet to demonstrate their anger, frustration, disbelief, and distrust in the judicial system. By putting off the protest, we lost critical momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">X. Lessons for Community Lawyers<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As lawyers, we have worked on many occasions with organizers to support the community's struggle for justice and equality. We are proud to lend our legal training and knowledge to support mobilization for causes such as equitable land use, environmental justice, and immigrant rights. However, the Quincy 4 case presented us with new challenges and new &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*120]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Organizer Versus Lawyer - Where Do Our Skills Lie?<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Although it was necessary for co-author Lai to assume the organizer role, leading the Support Committee violated a cardinal rule of community lawyering: a lawyer should not organize, let alone lead, a campaign or chair a Support Committee. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n168</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As is generally the case, the dual role of lawyer and organizer was problematic since organizing strategies often conflicted with legal considerations. For example, from an organizer's perspective, it would have helped organizing efforts for the victims to share their stories with the community; however, a lawyer would counsel the defendants to stay silent on details so as to avoid damaging their case. The lawyer's role is to protect the defendant's and not community's interests. Such conflicts persisted throughout the Quincy 4 case. We have learned that we cannot effectively serve two masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Support Committee often spoke to the community and press on behalf of the defendants who could not do so on their own. As chairperson during the pivotal initial months of the campaign, co-author Lai assumed this responsibility. This violated yet another important rule of community lawyering: never do for people what they can do themselves. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n169</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Resisting the Seduction of Power: Playing the Supporting Versus Lead Role<BR>&nbsp;<BR> On many occasions, the co-authors could have led the campaign in various ways. The community often looked to us to lead because we are lawyers and speak English. As professionals, we have been trained to lead and act as spokespersons. The potential for self-aggrandizement could have led us astray from the basic principles under which we have practiced for so many years: community lawyering is about empowering ordinary people to speak and act. We believe that, given the opportunity, people can speak for themselves. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n170</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On many occasions, it would have been easier and more efficient for us to speak or act on behalf of the community and then report back, but we consciously resisted this temptation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A case in point was the meeting with Quincy's Mayor. The co-authors were thrust into a situation as unelected delegates to speak with the Mayor. We could have easily met with him as representatives of the group and relayed the message to the community afterward. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n171</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, we steadfastly communicated that the supporters were waiting downstairs to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*121]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  meet with the Mayor. In the end, a room full of community members and diverse supporters all conversed with him. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n172</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To accentuate the co-authors' role as only facilitators, co-author Lai stepped away from the table and interpreted for many who had limited English proficiency. In such a situation, others employing a different model of empowerment might have met alone with the Mayor, thus silencing the supporters' voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As community lawyers, the co-authors believe that one of our main roles is that of a facilitator who allows the community to speak for itself. We knew that the community had been through multiple struggles and that its voice was as eloquent as ours if given the opportunity to exercise its power. This is the essential difference between the community lawyering model and an approach in which lawyers assume power to &quot;speak on behalf of the community&quot; on the implicit premise that the community is not sophisticated enough to address the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, in brokering this meeting, we emboldened community members to realize that they had the right to be there and express their opinions to the Mayor. The Mayor's invitation for the group to come to his office was an affront to the receptionist who would have barred the community, and to the waiting Quincy police who expected to enforce the blockade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Conducting Impromptu Community Legal Education About the Legal Process Through Court House Debriefing<BR>&nbsp;<BR> One key organizing principle was to support the defendants in the legal processes. For many observers, pre-trial hearings were their first exposure to the American court system. Prior to the first pre-trial hearing, the Support Committee briefed community observers on what to expect and advised them of courtroom etiquette. Yet, even for those who spoke English, the courtroom exchanges between the judge and the lawyers proved unintelligibly technical. Thus, after the first hearing, the Support Committee held bilingual debriefing sessions and began a series of impromptu bilingual community trainings on the American justice system. These sessions not only provided updates on the Quincy 4 case, but also explained how the court handled the other calendared cases witnessed by supporters. In these sessions the community learned about civil versus criminal systems, plea bargains, sentencing, and the limits of the criminal system's endeavors to punish and rehabilitate. These debriefings became the most valuable form of community legal education used during the Quincy 4 case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n173</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*122]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. Ensuring Access and Protecting Rights by Bridging Linguistic and Cultural Gaps<BR>&nbsp;<BR> As community lawyers, the co-authors are often called upon to bridge language barriers between the English-speaking world and limited-English-proficient clients and community members. The mantra of allowing ordinary people to speak for themselves is meaningless if they cannot communicate with the audience or understand the situation in which they must speak. As well, inability to understand rules and regulations governing the courtroom can cause misunderstanding and undue embarrassment for the limited-English-proficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Quincy 4 case, co-author Lai had, on numerous occasions, interpreted the instructions from the court officers and judge. Basic instructions prohibiting cellular phones, beverages, gum chewing, newspaper reading, and wearing of hats would have been missed and could have led to unnecessary furor or punishment from the bench, had co-author Lai not been there to interpret. These are minor details that the English-speaking public would not consider barriers to the courthouse, but they were important considerations for the Quincy 4 supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, bridging the communication gap involves interpreting cultural nuances beyond linguistics. During post-hearing debriefings, we addressed everything that transpired in court to provide a holistic perspective on how the system works. For instance, community members wondered why police officers who came to support their own case were allowed to stand despite the judge's &quot;no standing&quot; order. Or, more bewilderingly, why police officers were allowed to sit in front of the lawyer's bar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n174</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> next to the prosecution. Our answers to these questions dispelled idealistic views about American equality. Explanation of these minute issues helped reinforce the notion that the justice system does not just dispense equal justice unless people monitor and challenge it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&quot;Putting Race Back on the Table&quot;: Civil Rights is an Asian American Issue<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In the twenty-five years since the Vincent Chin case, the Asian American community has developed tremendously. Most notably, it has organized and developed its political clout. With the emergence of Asian Americans as players on the political front, and as well on multiple public policy fronts, issues that most immediately impact community members, such as anti-Asian violence, have taken a backseat. We must revisit the recommendations made over twenty years ago regarding anti-Asian violence. These recommendations include: (1) local and state government &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*123]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  review of whether their laws adequately protect Asian Americans' rights; (2) concerted efforts by the media to raise public awareness of incidences of anti-Asian violence, (3) restraint by political leaders from using &quot;race-baiting&quot; tactics in election campaigns; (4) coordinated national efforts to promote understanding of Asian Americans and to ensure the successful implementation of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, (5) training of local law enforcement to properly implement the Hate Crimes Statistics Act; (6) an increase in Asian American representation on police forces; (7) availability of interpreter services to limited-English-proficient Asian Americans in police departments; (8) establishment of police department and civilian review boards to actively monitor allegations of police harassment and brutality; and (9) police departments' adoption of community policing methods to build trust with Asian American community. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n175</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Americans still approach civil rights issues within a Black/White paradigm; unfortunately, it takes a tragedy like Vincent Chin's murder for mainstream society to link civil rights with Asian Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Need for Dedicated Resources to Tackle Anti-Asian Violence<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Following the Vincent Chin case, Asian Americans experienced an alarming increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. Finally, in this context of heightened violence, the Asian American community united to organize around hate crimes and related issues. Advocacy efforts arose on local, state, and national fronts to establish watch groups, hold hearings, enact legislation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n176</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to place civil rights officers in law enforcement positions ranging from those of local police to district attorney, attorney general, and other federal offices. On a community level, organizations such as the Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (&quot;CAAAV&quot;) in New York City were established to mobilize the Asian community. Over time, reflecting a broader trend across Asian America, CAAAV transformed into an organization fighting broader systemic injustices. This expansion of focus into other pressing policy issues naturally siphoned off resources from the issue at hand. Moreover, an exclusive focus on Anti-Asian violence may not have been financially feasible for these community-based &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*124]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  organizations, given their reliance on private foundations for support. Private donors interested in providing seed money to launch anti-hate crime initiatives may have been reluctant to devote too many resources over time to hate crime-related issues given the statistical trends For example, the 2002 hate crime audit report by the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium (&quot;NAPALC&quot;) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n177</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> noted a drop in hate crime rates. This drop arguably reflected not a decrease in incidents but less reporting by victims who feared anti-terrorism government policies. As a result, fewer resources have been devoted to tackling anti-Asian violence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n178</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late 1980s, the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office heralded a Civil Rights Office that had an Asian American liaison, but this position disappeared by the late 1990s. The ebb and flow in resources for addressing anti-Asian violence, locally and nationally, suggest that when we identify certain conditions as an emergency, mainstream authorities will respond with services or resource; however, once the incident fades into the past and community pressures slacken, programs and remedies are eliminated by cost-cutting measures. It has been suggested that, to counter the decline in resources allocated for hate crime prevention, we need to focus on increasing Asian American presence in the system through an increase in the number of Asian American police officers, political officials, and legal professionals. Such increase in representation is desirable, but it is an indirect and long-term solution for an urgent problem. In addition, no increase in Asian American personnel will automatically sensitize and change the flawed system. An adequate solution should incorporate not only this long-term indirect systemic approach, but also the programs initiated in the late 1980s that provided for staff experts on hate crimes. Moreover, in view of the link between anti-immigrant sentiments and anti-Asian hate crimes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n179</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> staff should be trained in immigration issues as well. As we struggle for these changes, we must keep our discourse focused on the underlying racial animus that drives hate crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F. Defining Success in the Face of Failure<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In the wake of disappointing verdicts and excessively harsh sentencing, it has been difficult to find success in the Quincy 4 case. Yet, as community lawyers and activists, we know that success is not solely defined by the immediate outcome of a case. As lawyers for Japanese American internees and for initial civil rights claimants did not see immediate results, we may not see success spring from the Quincy 4 case &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*125]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for many years. What is important in movement building is for participants to understand that if it were not for them and their supporters, many more Asian Americans might have been victimized. The hope is that the next time police officers stop an Asian American, they will think twice about their behavior and its consequences before they act. A pessimist might conclude that this case's outcomes would embolden police to terrorize the Asian American community. But the case's aftermath indicates otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the rally planned for the Tuesday after the trial was cancelled, the notice did not reach everyone. The Chinese press publicized the rally and reported that some people showed up. One photograph published by the Chinese newspaper showed a middle-aged Asian man in front of the Quincy Court House </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n180</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> engaging in symbolic protest by taping his mouth and &quot;handcuffing&quot; his hands in duct tape. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n181</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This man's actions evidence the community's refusal to be silenced and the way in which the Quincy 4 case has bolstered the community's protest against injustice. Even more significant is that this man had the courage to protest alone. Prior to the Quincy 4 incident, nothing like this show of bravery would have even been fathomable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, a few weeks after the decision, the CPA received a complaint from an Asian American homeowner in Quincy about discrimination from her condominium manager, who demanded that she secure unnecessary permits, including an elevator use permit (she lived on the ground floor), before she could move in. Meanwhile, her white husband (the manager was unaware of their relationship) was given free rein to move in without hassle. The incident raises several questions: (1) Why did the victim not report the incident to any Quincy Asian American organizations; and (2) Why did she contact the CPA instead? The fact that she came forward indicated that she was willing to fight this injustice, and her approaching the CPA in Boston suggested that she knew the organization would advocate for her as it had for the Quincy 4 - in ways that Quincy Asian American organizations might not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both examples indicate that the Quincy 4 case has raised consciousness about racial discrimination suffered by Asian Americans. Further, such awareness led to direct action in both instances. But for the visible courage of the Quincy 4, these instances and many more might not have happened. Taken together, these instances indicate progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">XI. Conclusion<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Today, twenty-five years after the Vincent Chin case, anti-Asian &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*126]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sentiments persist. A simple sign written in a non-English-language, intended as a service to linguistic minorities, is seen by the Whites as a threat. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n182</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This language issue has been complicated by feelings and displays of cultural pride. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n183</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One 2006 incident continues to plague an organization that flew a People's Republic of China flag alongside an American flag at its office. The issue stirred controversy from veteran groups who opposed the sight of a communist flag next to the American flag. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n184</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ward 6 Councilor Brian McNamee remarked during a city council hearing, &quot;If you want to live in America, don't be a hyphenated American, don't keep one foot planted in your country of birth and another in this country. Put both feet firmly in America.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n185</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to the news that the Chinese flagpole had been hacked, one resident wrote in a letter to the editor, &quot;But for the people who lost their flagpole to what is called vandals and continue to fly the Communist banner over Beal and Hancock Streets in Quincy, they call it vandalism. I call what the people did, Patriots. This country is known as a democracy, not a doctoral [sic] state, as is China. If the Chinese United Association wants to fly the Communist banner, let them fly it over their home property - China - not here in the United States of America.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n186</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These comments by white protesters reveal aversion to local diversity. Whereas it may be acceptable to describe European Americans as Italian Americans or Irish Americans, the same cannot be said for Asian Americans. Meanwhile, Irish flags are commonly found hanging in Quincy pubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Mary Orfanello's sentence may have been a blessing in disguise. Had she accepted the Assistant District Attorney's recommendation for probation and no jail time, the case would have &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*127]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disappeared and the cause for further organizing would have vanished. Instead, her excessive sentences outraged the Asian American community, just as the decision in Vincent Chin's criminal trial did. Even people who were unfamiliar with the judicial system found it extraordinary that defendants who were being convicted for minor infractions, and who had no prior records, were given jail time. Moreover, the harshness of the sentences may have awakened to action some Asian Americans who were previously skeptical about the defendants' innocence or about the Support Committee's strategies. Hopefully these skeptics have realized that silence, inactivity, and capitulation do not wear out injustice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although three of the Quincy 4 were convicted, the great achievement in the case has been the collective realization that standing up to challenge the powers that be - and the white establishment - is the beginning of victory for our community. It is our hope that if similar situations recur, the police in Quincy and beyond will act differently toward Asian Americans. This case is not merely about four individuals; it is about America's attitude towards Asian Americans involved in the criminal justice system, and it is about Asian America's attitudes towards people of color - including our own. Our community must realize that when one individual is wrongly incarcerated, we are all wrongly incarcerated. Though the Quincy 4 might have &quot;lost&quot; their case, we must remain vigilant in pressing on toward victory in the fight for equal justice.</SPAN></P>

It followed the million person march that took place in late March of 2006 during which immigrants and immigrant rights advocates called for humane immigration reform that included legalization for the estimated 12 million people lacking an immigration status in the United States. The date of the boycott was selected to coincide with International Workers' Day, which although not officially recognized in the United States, is celebrated in most parts of the world. The organizers of the strike called for supporters to refrain from buying, selling, working, and attending school in order to demonstrate the economic contribution and impact of both documented and undocumented immigrants. In Los Angeles alone, an estimated crowd of one million took to the streets. Similar demonstrations took place in many cities across the United States. In Massachusetts, there were small scale protests across the state, with an estimated 8,000 Latino students boycotting school.

I told them that I was going to spray them... . [Tat] had both clenched fists up in front of him. The others were right there with him and surging forward.

The second report filed by Officer Curtis more than five months after the incident contained a more embellished account of that night. In that account, Tat, Karen and Howard were all portrayed as &quot;wild and angry,&quot; as they &quot;surged forward towards [him]&quot; in a &quot;threatening manner,&quot; especially because the two men &quot;got into a fighters stance,&quot; thus forcing him to spray them &quot;using a sweeping motion&quot; after Quan was already sprayed and handcuffed on the hood of the car.

He also testified that Karen was affected by the pepper spray in the manner she was because she &quot;jumped in the fray&quot; and smudged her face on Quan in the area where he was sprayed. In court, Officer Curtis testified that he used his right foot to tilt open the car door, pinning it onto Quan while he used his right hand to grab Quan's left wrist, holding his pepper spray in his left hand and swaying his hips to the left to bump Karen off him. Officer Curtis claimed that he had warned the individuals that he was going to spray and sprayed a second time only because Tat and Howard approached him in fighters' stance, screaming at him that he had &quot;sprayed a girl,&quot; challenged him to fight, which made him fear for his life. See Trial Notes, supra note 5, at 15. In truth, Tat was still sitting in the second car as Quan, Howard, and Karen were pepper sprayed by Officer Curtis. Tat was not near Joanna's car where the mayhem occurred. See id. at 4-7, 28-30, 36-37. Howard, on the other hand, was positioned between Quan and Karen behind an open car door of the car, and was not in a position to approach Officer Curtis from his back, as the officer claimed.

Joanna's response of Somerville when the officer asked her where she was from was clearly not the name of the foreign country that the officer was expecting.

All are young Chinese Americans.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>While pulled over at a curb next to Super 88, they were approached by a state trooper. As they argued with the trooper, a Quincy police car pulled up. Without warning, a police officer jumped out and pepper-sprayed all three directly in the eyes at close range. Karen, who is just over five feet tall, was tackled by three male officers, receiving a black eye, swollen face, and bruises. Another friend was knocked unconscious.<BR>&nbsp;<BR><BR>&nbsp;<BR>Throughout the incident, the police repeatedly yelled at the victims, used profanities, and called them names.

They believed that by talking about what happened, others would see the truth and they would be exonerated. It was only after long, and often testy, discussions that they accepted counsel's advice to decline any request for interviews. The Support Committee and its designated spokespersons would become the voice for the Quincy 4. However, there continued to be dissention within the Support Committee as many continued to question the reason for &quot;silencing&quot; the victims. They believed that their previous experience organizing immigrants, workers, and tenants had informed them that the public needed to hear from the victims in order to drum up support. The concern was that anything the defendants said directly, and anything that might be attributable to them, could be used against them during the criminal trial. </SPAN></P>

Third, as a group they are seen as economically successful, especially compared to other ethnic minorities, even though they faced severe discrimination in the past and may encounter some (fairly minor) discrimination now. In other words, a regrettable history of past discrimination has not kept them down - and indeed may have spurred them on.

Larger household size, immigration paths and history, socioeconomic background, and English-language proficiency also play a role in these statistics. In dissecting the discussions that pitch Asian Americans as the &quot;model minority,&quot; one should question whether Asian Americans are being used to malign other groups and to dismantle programs that aim to eradicate the impact of generations of structural racism.

Half of the surveys were conducted during Quincy's August Moon festival in 2006, while the other half were distributed and collected through other community venues. The Support Committee collected a total of fifty-six completed surveys, thirty-nine of which were completed by Quincy residents. Forty-eight of the respondents claimed they got along with their neighbors, while five stated that they did not get along with their neighbors because of language or cultural barriers. When asked how often the respondents visited certain public facilities (public library, City Hall, City Council, public school/parent council, police department, public housing authority, and human resources office), the most visited place was the public library, where sixteen respondents said they visited. The least visited places were the City Council and the human resources offices, where only 1 respondent visited with some frequency. Some respondents indicated they had never visited certain public places because they perceived they would be treated either with hostility or be ignored. Six of the thirteen respondents who reported having occasionally visited the police department reported unwelcoming treatment, ranging from being ignored to being treated with hostility. In another part of the survey, thirteen of the respondents reported witnessing police discrimination. In response to the statement, &quot;In Quincy, I feel that I am treated differently because of my race, ethnicity, immigrant status, or English proficiency,&quot; twelve of the respondents answered &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;strongly agree,&quot; while nineteen responded &quot;disagree&quot; or &quot;strongly disagree.&quot; Surveys of Quincy residents (on file with authors). </SPAN></P>

When the co-authors' intern began to investigate, the advocacy group that received the initial complaint, the pastor who ran youth program, and a school guidance counselor who were privy to the facts all refused to discuss the matter. They claimed that the children's parents did not want to publicize the event and that because the attacker was a well-known bully, no racism was involved. The second incident involved the flying of the national flag of the Peoples' Republic of China by a newly-formed organization in Quincy. Although the organization could legally fly the flag, it needed a permit from the City before doing so. The City Council met to discuss how to discourage the organization from flying the flag because it was &quot;a symbol with unfavorable associations for some military veterans and Asian immigrants who fled China's Communist government.&quot; Robert Knox, Flag That Sparked Protest Comes Down: Quincy Awaits Forum on New Chinese Group, Boston Globe, Oct. 22, 2006, at 13; see Christopher Walker, Officials Would Like China Flag Taken Down, Patriot Ledger, Oct. 6, 2006, at 9.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8"> LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... The interlocking of past and present can be seen in Jena in the scene of lynching nooses at integrated schools; in the form of racialized punishment in the era of formal legal equality; and, pointedly, in the ability of a prosecutor to take away a child's life &quot;with the stroke of a pen.&quot; ... In other words, what is at issue is not that Jena has become a high-profile historical event, but rather that the kind of legal and social punishment of blacks that took place in Jena typifies the everyday practice of criminal law and its endorsement by white civil society throughout the nation.  ... In Western culture, freedom came to mean full ownership of property rights in oneself.  ... More importantly, extensive archival evidence from slave narratives exemplifies the routine terror of sexual and other forms of physical and psychological violence under slavery.  ... Leon Higginbotham comments, the Missouri court &quot;held that the end of slavery is not merely 'the economic profit of the master' but also the joy of the master in the sexual conquest of the slave.&quot; ... Power is effectively insulated by the personal subjectivities of those people (still mostly white but now increasingly other races as well) whose investments it represents and deposits in the social structures of this society.  ... This divide does not produce a hierarchy of humanity; instead, it produces a finite schism between the realm of humanity (whites/Europe) and nonhumanity (blacks/Africa).  ... First, it provides cohesion for white civil society against the perceived threat of blackness, and enforces allegiance to white supremacy; second, gratuitous violence against black bodies is the language through which this solidarity is achieved; and third, it is the bridge between slavery and the contemporary prison industrial complex in terms of the impunity claimed by the police and white people's prerogative to ignore this antiblack violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The welcome sign at the entrance to Jena, Louisiana, describes it as &quot;a nice place to call home.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent events involving its criminal justice system, however, produce a counternarrative at the intersection of race and law that refutes this slogan. Trouble in Jena arose in September 2006 over the contestation of race and space when a black student named Kenneth Purvis asked Jena High School authorities for permission to sit under the &quot;white tree,&quot; a de facto segregated gathering place exclusively occupied by white students during school breaks. The school principal informed Purvis that he could sit wherever he pleased, and along with two of his buddies, the young man did just that.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following morning, the student body arrived to find three nooses, painted black, dangling from the tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly afterwards, white District Attorney J. Walters Reed accompanied several police officers to address a Jena High School assembly. In a throwback to the days of Bull Connor, he threatened the black students for protesting and &quot;making a fuss about this innocent prank,&quot; claiming that he could be their &quot;best friend or worst enemy.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next he informed the black students, &quot;With the stroke of my pen, I can make your lives disappear.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*236]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Joiner provided the students with a didactic lesson in the history of race and law in America: blacks are more likely to be victimized by state violence than they are to be recipients of equal protection from the rule of law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The school was put on lockdown for the remainder of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later that fall, on November 30, 2006, a fire burned down the main academic building of Jena High School. The next evening, December 1, 2006, a black student possessing a printed invitation to a white party was beaten up, and on December 2, 2006, Matt Windham, a young white man, pulled out a shotgun in a confrontation with several black youth at a local convenience store. When the black youth defended themselves and seized the gun, they were arrested for theft of a firearm,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> second-degree robbery,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and conspiracy  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to commit second-degree robbery. No charges were filed against the white man.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, on December 4, 2006, at Jena High School, a white student named Justin Barker--who allegedly was making racial taunts, including calling the African American students &quot;niggers&quot; and supporting the white students who hung the nooses and beat up the black student off-campus--was knocked down, punched, and kicked by six black students.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The white provocateur was taken to the hospital, treated, and released with minor bruises. He attended a social function that evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All six black teens were charged with attempted second-degree murder, a charge that was later determined to be unsubstantiated according to the Louisiana Criminal Code.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amidst controversy, Prosecutor Reed reduced the charges to aggravated second-degree battery  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and conspiracy to commit aggravated second-degree battery.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under Louisiana criminal law, the aggravated charge requires the use of a weapon. Prosecutor Walters argued the tennis shoes worn by Mychal Bell, one of the black teens, and used to kick Barker constituted the dangerous weapons, an argument the jury ultimately accepted.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At trial, the system continued to exact its violence. Public defender Blane Williams, himself a black man, not only encouraged Bell to accept a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*237]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plea for a crime that was unsubstantiated by the facts of the case, but he failed to perform his duties as a zealous advocate for his client.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams failed to challenge the all-white jury composition  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and rested the defense without offering any evidence or calling a single witness.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury deliberated less than three hours and returned a conviction for Mychal Bell.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edna Thompson, a long-time friend of the Bells, summed up the jury's decision: &quot;The best thing if you're black in this town is to stay out of the system, because once they get you, you're done for. You're not getting out.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public outrage, protests, and rallies helped provoke judicial review, which overturned the conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile since he was sixteen at the time of his arrest.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 3, 2007, Bell pled guilty to a reduced charge of battery and was sentenced to eighteen months in a juvenile facility. The cases of the remaining five youth, four of whom were over seventeen at the time of the incident--legal adults in Louisiana--are still pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These six lives remain suspended in what we are characterizing here as the legal proceedings of &quot;raw life.&quot; To live in the era of raw life is to occupy the crossroads of life and death. The interlocking of life and death signals the entanglement of past, present, and future.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Cornel West, in characterizing the United States in the twenty-first century as a &quot;twilight civilization&quot; replete with &quot;pervasive cultural decay&quot; and the &quot;dangerous rumblings&quot; of the stigmatized, policed, and degraded Others, illuminates the retrograde direction of this society at the very moment of its most powerful ascendancy.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the Postcolonial theorist Achille Mbembe, this emergent temporal context--the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">time</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of black suffering--is marked by a future horizon that is apparently closed, while the past appears to have receded. Ours is thus a &quot;time of entanglement,&quot; a space &quot;where life and death are so entangled that it is no longer possible to distinguish them&quot;: the age of raw life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interlocking of past and present can be seen in Jena in the scene of lynching nooses at integrated schools; in the form of racialized &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*238]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  punishment in the era of formal legal equality; and, pointedly, in the ability of a prosecutor to take away a child's life &quot;with the stroke of a pen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the course of the next three parts of this article, we trace the origins and development of raw life. From this vantage point, the form of power operative in our contemporary prison regime is embodied in the desire of whites to literally consume the bodies of racialized Others. The history of colonization is replete with records of Europeans literally carving, cooking, and using the bodies of indigenous Africans and Americans.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The history of North American slavery further demonstrates how modern idioms of power are vested in the fungibility of black bodies--their usefulness for the whims and purposes of whites. Our objective here, then, is to closely examine how the state-sanctioned control of the black body from slavery to the contemporary prison regime--an analysis that usually remains at the level of analogy, that the criminal justice system today is like the slavery of yesterday--illumines just how intimately the past structures contemporary struggles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part I, the &quot;Ethics of Parasitic Pleasure,&quot; reaches back to slavery, the institution through which white desires were given expression and defined value in terms of bodily sovereignty: whites attract honor, respect, and power--</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">value</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">--by virtue of not simply possessing their own bodies, but through their ability to accumulate black bodies as their pleasure-things. We use this socio-legal lens in order to relate the prosecutions in Jena to the formation of the modern Western world and its production of value. Conversely, blacks entered the modern Western world as devalued human beings. So, too, did the six young boys arrested and charged in the Jena case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part II uses the slave codes of the antebellum era to establish the fraudulent ethics surrounding the &quot;rule of law&quot; in the Jena case. The law manifests this fraud in a number of ways worth recounting here. The rule of law presupposes that its subjects have given their consent to being governed, which merely mystifies the reality of captivity, torture, mayhem, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*239]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and the requirement of total submission for blacks. At the same time, the law decriminalized the white violence that was essential in holding together the nascent bourgeois democracy. This legal regime also buttressed the moral authority claimed by the ruling class; for decades white violence was cloaked in morality. Yet after the point when such violence became a sign of immorality, the violence did not cease; rather, it became the basis for the fraudulent ethics of white civil society today. This &quot;ethics of fraud,&quot; as we refer to it, helps us understand how Jena unfolded through a legal framing of black criminality versus white innocence--how every act by the black teens was a punishable legal offense, while the white teens violated the law and black bodily sovereignty, with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part III uses the post-Emancipation era to reiterate the point that no transcendent moment altered the paradigmatic relation of the black body to the idiom of power that blacks lived under prior to 1865.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gratuitous and irrational violence continued to capture the black body during the era of lynching. Our review of this period contributes a crucial dimension to our understanding of Jena. Lynchings teach us that policing blackness provides indispensable social cohesion for white civil society; that decriminalized white violence is the mechanism by which this community is forged; and therefore that impunity by the police and the ability of whites to ignore this antiblack violence are the marks of a deeper white solidarity that goes beyond differences in region, class, creed, or political affiliation. Part IV concludes with a brief but critical discussion of why the Jena case is fundamental to understanding how white supremacy is so deeply engrained in U.S. culture, in that it not only continues to inform the intrinsic political and psychic structures of this society, but its de facto legality presents little room in which to construct an alternate reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jena Six case emerges from a legal regime with a particular history of perversion regarding the lives of African Americans. Dating back to the slave codes of the South  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and progressing through the Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and 1850 (which often exacted harsher punishment than plantation &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*240]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  justice itself)  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to several landmark legal decisions such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Plessy v. Ferguson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1896)  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Pace v. Alabama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1883),  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the law has continuously guaranteed black suffering in terms of black people's status as negated subjects. In the well-known words of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Dred Scott v. Sanford</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision, the Negro was so far inferior that his reduction to slavery was not only &quot;to his benefit&quot; but also that he had &quot;no rights that the white man was bound to respect.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article proffers an analysis of the Jena Six grounded in this historical context, going beyond mere acknowledgment of the debts that our present-day criminal justice system owes to the institution of slavery to approach an assessment of the violence blacks regularly face in the law, an encounter almost so mundane it escapes representation. A wide range of scholars have well documented that the U.S. ruling class crafted the contemporary U.S. prison regime as a replacement for the system of chattel slavery.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This legacy can be seen in our nation's jails and prisons.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As significant scholarship suggests, the Jena Six assumes its place within slavery's modern legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can we move beyond the limits of analogy? The Jena Six is much more complex than a metaphor can convey: What does it mean to be, in the words of Frantz Fanon, &quot;an object in the midst of other objects,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to live in &quot;the domain of non-existence?&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born and raised in the French Caribbean colony of Martinique and later educated as a psychiatrist in Lyon, Fanon became an authority on how white supremacy renders the humanity of the colonized subject invisible. When he served as the head clinician at a psychiatric hospital in French-occupied Algeria during the mid-1950s, Fanon came to the realization that the Western discourse on man and civilization--whether in philosophy or medicine--literally expunged the black from existence. For Fanon, therefore, what it means to be &quot;an object in the midst of other objects,&quot; to not be seen as a human being but instead objectified as if he were a chair or a log, is a question that is unapproachable: it exceeds the limits of representation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*241]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What Fanon means by this formulation, and why his insight matters for our purposes here, is that proper recognition of the problem before us is always and already circumscribed by the language we have available to us with which to identify our injuries. Insofar as the law establishes how we name and remedy injustice, it sets out the language in which we must locate our selves. The problem of race, however, cannot be adequately understood through the language of law. In this way, analyzing the Jena case--and other mundane operations of white supremacy--necessitates deconstructing law itself as a racial project in which black existence has been systematically occluded. A major reason for the difficulty in getting close enough to the problem of racial injustice in the law to offer a just response to it is what we have referred to as the entanglements of raw life. The task before us, therefore, is to lay out the ways in which the age of raw life retains the depths of earlier eras: a contingent existence that reveals itself through the guise of legal life and the stark horror of premature death.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our discussion is neither about the legal aspects of the Jena Six case, nor about the six young men whose lives have been irreparably damaged.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former has been well vetted in domestic and international legal discussions, and while a rich treatment of the latter has yet to be done, it remains beyond the scope of this article.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, we examine the socio-legal context that produces the events in Jena and analyze how those events represent a moment of truth in what we refer to as &quot;racial ordinariness&quot;: defined as another instance in the historically invariant punishment of black people, a banal spectacle that gives us the occasion to put black experience at the center of our analysis of U.S. legal regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviewing the history of the black experience before the law clearly demonstrates that the Jena Six case is anything but unprecedented. U.S. history features a consistent storyline regarding blacks and the law, largely undeviated from--one which historian Mary Frances Berry referred to as &quot;black resistance [to] white law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Berry reminds us that &quot;[w]hether its policy was action or inaction, the national government has used the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*242]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Constitution in such a way as to make law the instrument for maintaining a racist status quo.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Jena Six case joins this long history of constitutional spectacles--moments where the law is revealed not as the protector of minority rights, as liberal historiographers and philosophers would have us believe  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --as a manifestation of civil society's commitment to not only maintain white dominance in economic, political, social, and military matters, but to effectuate blackness as the most trod-upon station in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the popular conception of Jena is one of racist excess--of racism corrupting the otherwise fair process of justice--to conceptualize it as such obscures the mundane reality of black punishment. In other words, recounting the history of crimes against constitutionality, as numerous race scholars and historians such as Berry and Derrick Bell have already done, produces the necessary conditions for arguing the banality of the Jena Six case.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it cannot provide the sufficient grounds for gaining traction on what white supremacy means to the U.S. legal regime. Whenever one attempts to speak about the rules of race and power, one is forced back into a discussion of spectacular events--high-profile legal battles such as the Jena Six, for instance.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem is that the spectacular actually camouflages the routine, the normal operation of the law against blacks in all its everyday terror and contempt, its misbehavior and broken ethicality. In other words, what is at issue is not that Jena has become a high-profile historical event, but rather that the kind of legal and social punishment of blacks that took place in Jena </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">typifies</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the everyday practice of criminal law and its endorsement by white civil society throughout the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to everyday life, the secret of the law, hidden in plain sight, is that there is no recourse to the disruption of black life by the mundane violence of living in a white supremacist society. The annals of contemporary legalized violence against black bodies are indeed spectacular, and the readily available examples merely hint at the terror defining black existence before the law: from the police beatings of Rodney &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*243]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  King or Oletha Waugh,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the torture of Abner Louima,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the killing of Amadou Diallo,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the violent deaths of Malice Green  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Johnny Gammage,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the recent shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his wedding day.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the analytic vantage point of raw life, the racial violence of legal doctrine is also alive and well. The volatility of numerous Reconstruction era cases, briefly mentioned earlier, entangles with contemporary cases such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Wilson v. State</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Lewis v. Casey.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The numerous black men exonerated by DNA evidence and freed from prison through the Innocence Project, the prosecutors and District Attorneys who steadfastly maintain these men's guilt despite the irrefutable scientific evidence, and the numerous anonymous men and women condemned prior to the recent era of technological advances in forensic criminology--these are the signs of raw life in the domain of nonexistence.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To focus on any one of these spectacles is to deploy, and thereby reaffirm, the logic of the law itself. Documenting the law's excesses, in an attempt to explain the paradigm of white supremacist violence, merely renders it nonparadigmatic, and reduces it to the fraudulent ethics on which the law bases its ongoing hegemony. What makes the spectacle &quot;spectacular&quot; is precisely that the essential logic of the law remains unshaken. Such discrete examples cannot represent the spectrum in which this paradigm manifests today--what might be called the &quot;paradigm of policing&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --from the explicit violence of police homicides to the more subtle violence of the Jena Six case and the faceless millions held captive by the prison industrial complex. This violence against the black body is structural and foundational to U.S. society--not contingent or excessive--and it is this banal but essential quality to racism that the spectacular examples render unrecognizable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective of this article, therefore, is to take the Jena Six case and examine it not in terms of its excessiveness, but in terms of its ordinariness. Full interrogation and complete understanding requires examining how the law itself has evolved through the state's relationship to captive black &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*244]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  bodies. The law is not merely a mechanism for maintaining a racist status quo.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the contrary, the law is itself constituted through state violence against blacks, from slavery to our present-day prison regime. The point to be examined here is historical and socio-legal in the sense that such an inquiry requires situating our particular spectacle--the Jena Six--at the locus of power created through the conjoined forces of the modern state, law, and race. As Fanon called for, however, this kind of analysis necessarily takes us beyond the law, beyond the political economy of inequality, and into the symbolic economy that produces the meaning of racialized bodies in the first place. We suggest that it is at these final levels--the problem of existence, or as W. E. B. DuBois put it, &quot;what it means to be a problem&quot;--that the spectacle of Jena can be grasped finally, not in terms of an instance of excess, but rather as precisely another moment in the invidious ethos of legalized terror that characterizes black suffering in the age of raw life, and constitutes the vernacular for everything in this society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. JENA AND THE ETHICS OF PARASITIC PLEASURE</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c35">There is a quest for the Negro, the Negro is in demand, one cannot get along without him, he is needed, but only if he is made palatable in a certain way. Unfortunately, the Negro knocks down the system and breaks the treaties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c36"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--W.E.B. Du Bois</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slavery is the indispensable starting point for our inquiry into the kind of state violence that produced the Jena spectacle because it is at this historical juncture that three central tropes of Western society--freedom, the individual, and private property--come together in the form of the law. These particularly Eurocentric concepts indicate a shift in power from the premodern era, globally speaking, but specifically for the experiences of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*245]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  black people. Slavery was the occasion for a transition from a system of property in which &quot;a right to things [is] realized through a hold on persons&quot; to one in which &quot;a hold on persons [is] realized through a right to things.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Western culture, freedom came to mean full ownership of property rights in oneself. This new idiom of power meant that the basic unit of the expansionist societies of Europe in the early modern period was the individual. The concept of rights, including rights to the labor of oneself and others, being vested in the individual, is rightly described as &quot;the peculiar institution,&quot; given its youth with respect to the long history in human civilization of slavery and other bonded relations.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The institution of waged labor and the legal regime in which worker and employer related to each other as autonomous agents, then, was just as peculiar to the African and indigenous societies that provided the slave laborers as plantation slavery was to these societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope that the relationship between citizen and the state permitted for the individual points to the severe contingency of rights. In their very formulation, rights are relative to their social recognition and institution: subjects possess rights only insofar as they are imbued with value by the social and political systems in which they exist. The social construction of a right is beholden to the prevailing ideologies in which the civil system is based. Europe's emergent Enlightenment philosophers, for example, defined humanity in relationship to reason: to be human meant to possess the capacity for rational thought.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Committed as they were to moral notions of equality and autonomy, Enlightenment philosophers avoided inconsistency by justifying racialized and gendered subordination; this involved denying the rational capacity of women, Africans, and other subaltern peoples.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With subaltern humanity circumscribed in this way, enslavement, colonization, and discrimination became not only acceptable, but the moral imperative of a civilized people. For instance, John Stuart Mill, one of Europe's most prominent political philosophers, was a committed proponent of England's colonization of India during the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*246]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  nineteenth century on the grounds that it advanced general civilizing and utilitarian benefits of capitalist development for the sake of the colonized.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important point for our purposes here is the deeply imbricated co-formation of European expansionism and imperialism; liberal notions of humanity, reason, autonomy, freedom, and rights; and the construction of racial definition and discourse.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Locke, who served as a colonial administrator like Mill, established the notion that the right to property is as basic as the rights to life and liberty. The context of the emergent Western social and political system, however, permits taking this right to entail a right to property in another human being.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, the liberalism of the modern state, which implied the freedom to enslave others, was crucial to European overseas expansion.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ideology of individualism and the rights-bearing subject, therefore, needs closer scrutiny as a significant factor in the European will to conquer.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Western legal tradition emerging from this history of conquest conceives of a right as the conjunction of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">freedom</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to do whatever one chooses and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">claim</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be protected from interference by others (whether individual, group, or state) in so doing.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This individual capacity is translated as a universal power for the subject to act positively to secure his or her needs, and thus to preempt interference, when in fact it is a highly contingent power, resting in part upon the context of conquest.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commitment to the rights-conception of the individual emergent in Western culture reveals an intrinsic conflict that is most clearly played out in racial terms. The right of each individual to unobstructed self-direction and self-rule creates a clash of directions and rules as each individual seeks to assert and impose the inviolability of their rights.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This individualist calculus produces a zero-sum game whereby the rights of some will inevitably mean the denial of another's rights. As French postmodern philosopher Michel Foucault explains, a &quot;right should be viewed . . . not in terms of a legitimacy to be established, but in terms of the subjugation that it instigates.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*247]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a society formed indelibly through racial conquest, the rights of those included will be understood as inviolable primarily by misrecognizing the rights of the excluded as irrelevant. Liberalism's emphasis on equality and universality, however, renders the racial specification of this exclusion in other terms: &quot;just&quot; wars, paternalistic colonialism, civilization, &quot;the march of progress,&quot; &quot;manifest destiny,&quot; and the savage or childlike nature of the enslaved. The champions of individual liberty emerged from Europe to seek their freedom through the enslavement of others. This point is the crux of the matter when the Western ideology of individualism is concerned: any pursuit of emancipation or freedom is curbed at precisely the moment where self-consciousness picks up. When the Western subject begins to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">imagine</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself or herself as &quot;free,&quot; he or she inevitably does so through an implicit understanding of the control over or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">un-freedom</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of another.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, Western culture, with liberalism's emphasis on individual rights and autonomy, emerges </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">through</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western Europe's clash with Africa and the Americas, not prior to, or simply as a result of, this conquest. In this way the very notion of what it means to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">be</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;free,&quot; to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">possess</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> liberty, is dependent upon an understanding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">un-freedom</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and knowing which subjects not only are incapable of possessing themselves, but are, moreover, justly acquired and used by others. Throughout the epistemology of Western culture, race is the recurring boundary line between those subjects understood to be human and those humans whose existence was denied.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, Western notions of freedom, liberty, individual rights, and property are all profoundly bound up with the enslavement of the racialized Other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Western notions of freedom necessarily require the enslavement of others, another critical question emerges: Why was slavery reserved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">exclusively</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for non-Europeans, and most particularly, for Africans? Why were Europeans not used for slave labor? European history is replete with the practice of labor coercion--the demonstrated willingness by European elites to kill, use, and persecute lower classes and minority groups; and the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*248]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  disposition to deprive people of liberty and conscripting their labor as punishment for behaviors constructed as criminal. All of this social violence makes it appear arbitrary to draw the line at enslavement.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, European societies have long-standing practices of internal racialism and of deploying differences to organize hierarchies.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the fact that it would have been much more profitable to enslave fellow Europeans, there is no evidence that Europeans ever considered instituting full chattel slavery of Europeans in their overseas settlements. The decision to enslave Africans was as unthinking as it was a matter of course to not enslave Europeans.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the eleventh century, at least, a civilization ingrained in racialism ultimately found that its formative internal differences were not different enough to enslave.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;brave New World,&quot; built through the transmutation of Africa, was begun by approaching a particular body (the black) with direct relations of force (slavery).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This conception of the modern era contrasts with that of liberal historiography in which modernity is marked by the rise of the bourgeois nation-state and the struggles of white citizen-subjects for membership and political representation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also contrasts with Marxist historiography, which understands the dawn of the modern era to be the struggles between a white body and variable capital (waged relations).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slave is the very condition of possibility not only for capitalism and the success of Enlightenment notions of the civilized, rational, and unraced subject; it is also the foundation on which legal discourse arises. Our purpose here is to relocate rights as the result of a &quot;fatal coupling of power and knowledge.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What rights blacks have, or how best to mobilize them, are juridical debates that participate in a larger deception. The very concept of a right presupposes something that blacks historically have never had since the dawn of Western modernity--sovereignty over their own bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Atlantic slave trade was a profound historical rupture, fundamentally degrading the personality of black human beings, all the while obsessing over black flesh.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the very processes employed to produce the body of &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*249]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the African slave for consumption and use in the global libidinous system of racial capitalism, slavery bestows visibility on the structure and enormity of what is usually private and incommunicable, contained within the boundaries of the bodies of those who suffer pain. At its base, slavery achieves the conversion of absolute pain into the fiction of absolute power in an obsessive, self-conscious, fetishistic, and parasitic display of agency.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For this reason, the procedures essential to the history of racial slavery and its pernicious afterlife have not been its brutal regime of labor exploitation nor its utility to the advent and maturation of Eurocentric capitalism. Rather, slavery is enabled by, and dependent upon, the most basic of operations: &quot;symbolic and material immobilization, the absolute </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">divestment of sovereignty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the site of the black body: its freedom of movement, its conditions of labor, its physical and emotional sustenance, its social and sexual reproduction, its political and cultural representation.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The legacy of slavery that continues to impress itself upon our social, psychic, and legal structures into the twenty-first century, bears this imprint of bodily dispossession and aggrandizement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put it another way, we are working from a definition of slavery that is grounded in an analysis of what the practice signals about the symbolic universe and how physical bodies are constructed in relationship to each other. White supremacy's reliance upon black dehumanization means that enslavement of Africans was never reducible to mere economic logic. White violence against the black body was compelled by a complex mixture of conscious identification, unconscious fears, and subconscious longings.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Loss of one's own body signals capture by direct relations of force. As a captive entity, fixed in an undynamic state, &quot;subject to be mortgaged, according to the rules prescribed by law,&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the slave did not enter into a transaction of value. In this way, slavery was a social death; this is what it means to say that slaves did not exist as human beings.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ethos of slavery that we are pointing to is an economy of desire in which value is produced. However, because value works by mystifying its very processes &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*250]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of determining values, the worth of white and black bodies appears natural, rather than as the result of violent encounters.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The symbolic economy of slavery is more fundamental to its existence than is the political economy. In other words, the constituent elements of slavery begin with desire for the symbols of purity, honor, and humanity represented by whiteness and made possible by blackness and for the pleasure, exoticism, and self-loathing epitomized by blackness as constructed in opposition to whiteness. In addition to the surplus value produced from their labor, the accumulation of black bodies generated a symbolic economy in which slaves were valuable simply for the fact that they existed as things for the satisfaction of the whims of the captor.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is for this reason that the work performed by black slaves is historically significant, but it was not the primary reason for the slaves' (non)being. In the constellation of values that white supremacy establishes, bourgeois democracy mystifies the value of black bodies. As Cornel West puts it:</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[White supremacy] dictates the limits of the operation of American democracy--with black folk the indispensable sacrificial lamb vital to its sustenance. Hence black subordination constitutes the necessary condition for the flourishing of American democracy, the tragic prerequisite for America itself. This is, in part, what Richard Wright meant when he noted, &quot;The Negro is America's metaphor.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To state it more pointedly, black death provides the very conditions of possibility for white life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This point is not hyperbole or melodrama; it is drawn from an analysis of the discursive structure of slavery and the material realities it calls into being. Slave codes in the southern United States demanded that slaves receive clothing, food, and lodging sufficient to their basic needs. Slaves, although dead to rights and responsibilities--civil death--were reduced to nothing but the physical bodies, unprotected against capture, mutilation, and torture.<BR><BR>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*251]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  II.

<P CLASS="c36"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Jared Sexton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his famed masterpiece </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">The Souls of Black Folks,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> W. E. B. Du Bois expresses contempt for the legal vestiges of slavery. He opined that the slave experience caused &quot;[n]egroes . . . to look upon courts as instruments of injustice and oppression, and upon those convicted in them as martyrs and victims.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We need to think through Jena, too, in terms of the manner in which slave codes during the antebellum period constructed a universe of fraudulent morality, which continues to be perpetuated in two ways. First, in asserting the rule of law, white society shrouds the conditions of violent domination behind the myth of consent. The slave is presumed to give his or her consent to being dominated as a consequence of his or her utter powerlessness, or perfect subjugation. Second, slavery has such an extensive legal history precisely because the slave so frequently violated these terms, resisting the absolute authority of white civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the discursive order of slavery was preoccupied with how to mark the black body as socially dead and therefore as existing beyond the penumbra of legal rights and responsibilities. Simply put, the law decreed that the black body is a fraud. To be a fraudulent person is to impersonate a human being. There is only one such position in the ontology of the modern Western world and it belongs to the black. The lasting ideological and affective matrix of white supremacy admits no legitimate claims of black self-possession, self-determination, or autonomy in the face of white society's desire to possess, consume, and enjoy the captive body of blacks. This ethos of slavery is far more central to understanding violence against &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*252]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the black body than simply the immiserated conditions (including &quot;disparate treatment&quot; by the state and civil society) that blacks share with other people of color, workers, and the poor generally under global corporate capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of legal decisions demonstrate the violence of this fraudulent ethic. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">State of Missouri v. Celia, a Slave,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Celia was prosecuted for the murder of her owner, who had been raping her regularly in the four years since he purchased her. Celia was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. How could a slave be tried for murder? Is not murder a human act, something requiring agency and a reasoning subjectivity, a mind capable of forming intention and a will to carry out that intent?  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By definition, slavery is the absence of these qualities. The court recognized Celia as human, however, solely in the context of criminal liability: the slave's will was acknowledged only as it was prohibited or punished.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The criminality imputed to Celia disavowed the banal terror of white violence and its instrumentality in state power. The slave woman could neither give nor refuse consent to sex, nor could she offer reasonable resistance to being raped. In the trial record, the history of rape is only obliquely acknowledged as &quot;sexual intercourse.&quot; From the perspective of the law, Celia's body represents the vested interests of others, rather than the vessel of an intrinsic human agency; black criminality was thus a necessary response by the state to this threatening agency of blackness.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous additional cases prove that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Missouri v. Celia</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was typical rather than anomalous. More importantly, extensive archival evidence from slave narratives exemplifies the routine terror of sexual and other forms of physical and psychological violence under slavery.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law, on the other hand, records state terrorism (slavery) in terms that mask the violence necessary for its operation. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Alfred v. State,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alfred, a slave, was sentenced to death for murdering the overseer who raped the slave's wife, Charlotte.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the defense sought to have Charlotte testify on behalf of her husband, the prosecution objected. The court sustained the objection on the grounds that Charlotte's relation to Alfred (that of a wife and her &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*253]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  husband) had no legal status; the denial of marital relation, in turn, negated the violence that had precipitated Alfred's act of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law's repression of state violence transmogrifies Charlotte's rape into mere &quot;adultery&quot; and Alfred's act into &quot;outrages of conjugal affections.&quot; As in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Missouri v. Celia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Alfred</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court endorses the indiscriminate use of the slave body for pleasure, profit, and punishment. As A. Leon Higginbotham comments, the Missouri court &quot;held that the end of slavery is not merely 'the [economic] profit of the master' but also the joy of the master in the sexual conquest of the slave.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The normativity of rape that derives from the violence of the law is also produced through the law's refusal to recognize any legitimate social relations among the enslaved. Bodily dispossession and its fungibility for white civil society are enabled by constructing the black body as a &quot;genealogical isolate&quot;--a being disconnected from both ancestors and progeny.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slavery achieves this rupture by outlawing African cultural expression; by proscribing parenthood, principally through the separation of children from their &quot;parents&quot;; and through the master's property interest in the female reproductive body.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, the slave is bound only to the human realm through property relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The famous North Carolina Supreme Court decision State v. Mann demonstrates how the law simultaneously manifests this fraudulent ethic and represents a significant terrain on which the obvious contradictions are managed. Mann was indicted for assault and battery upon Lydia, a slave whom he had hired for a year from another slave owner, Elizabeth Jones. &quot;During the term, the slave had committed some small offence, for which the Defendant undertook to chastise her--that while in the act of so doing, the slave ran off, whereupon the Defendant called upon her to stop, which being refused, he shot and wounded her.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lower court convicted Mann, finding him guilty of &quot;cruel and unwarrantable punishment, and disproportionate to the offense committed by the slave.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In overturning &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*254]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the conviction, however, the North Carolina Supreme Court emphasized that the slave had</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no will of his own [and he must surrender] his will in implicit obedience to that of another. Such obedience is the consequence of uncontrolled authority over the body. There is nothing else that can operate to produce the effect. The power of the master must be absolute to render the submission of the slave perfect.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Court held that this absolute power was not a matter for legal debate and that the purpose of the slave codes was to convince each slave that &quot;there is no remedy&quot; for injury at the hands of the master.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision is significant in many respects. It is certainly noteworthy for the bald language of power it deploys--the supreme authority it reserves for whites and the total surrender it requires from blacks. We suggest, however, that the importance of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision lies with the cultural codes of white supremacy that the law draws upon and reaffirms. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court asserted that although the power of the master had to be absolute in order to render the &quot;submission of the slave perfect,&quot; &quot;[a]s a principle of moral right, every person in his retirement must repudiate it. But in the actual condition of things it must be so.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the harshness of this absolute power would be regulated not by legislative fiat or judicial restraint, but rather by &quot;the private interest of the owner, the benevolence toward each other, seated in the hearts of those who have been born and bred together, the . . . deep execrations of the community upon the barbarian, who is guilty of excessive cruelty to his unprotected slave.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, the naked brutality of the law was to be ameliorated by the feelings of benevolence and affection between master and slave. The master was expected, out of the goodness of his heart, to care enough for the enslaved that he would not punish them too harshly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cultural terms, this legal discourse is profoundly and fatally contradictory. First, the notion that perfect submission--total and utter surrender of bodily sovereignty--is a fundamental ordering principle of the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*255]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  society, to be policed by whatever violent means necessary, means that public order and &quot;harmony&quot; (to use the language of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Mann</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> court) requires systemic state violence. Second, this violence was understood to be regulated through an appeal to the morality of whites, rather than through legal or political bonds. In this way, white civil society preserved a moral self-image on the one hand and established the prerogative for brutal violence on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to fully appreciate the cultural impact of this legal discourse, we should remind ourselves that the unwritten complement of slave law was the decriminalization of white violence that serves as the founding gesture of society. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Commonwealth v. Turner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Virginia court upheld the master's right to extreme forms of punishment. The only dissenting justice argued that a slave was entitled to protection as a person &quot;except so far as the application of it conflicted with the enjoyment of the slave as a thing.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coupling of tyranny with affection-- absolute dominion with moral sensibility--established a fraudulent ethic in which the pleasures of parasitism were experienced as morality. As we move our analysis towards the afterlife of slavery, the realm in which we now live, it is worth observing that this form of power becomes both increasingly tenuous and progressively more difficult to dislodge. Whites continue to respond in personal and moral terms to challenges to the status quo; moving into the twenty-first century, assertions of racism and racial inequality are almost impossible to make without being consumed by personal affront or dissipated into an isolated case. Power is effectively insulated by the personal subjectivities of those people (still mostly white but now increasingly other races as well) whose investments it represents and deposits in the social structures of this society.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*256]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  III. JENA AND THE ETHICS OF WHITE SOLIDARITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power that centuries of slavery bequeath us is most clearly understood in terms of antiblackness. The Western world structures itself according to an Aristotelian, binary logic of opposition. This binary system of meaning works contextually by always placing any two terms as far from each other as possible; that which supposedly differentiates them constitutes the organizing principle for the schema.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, since the Western system works by placing positivity and establishing its self-identity on the value of the white, it structures its primary opposition--negativity--on the level of the black. To speak of racial opposition, then, is to reference an antiblack world in which two principles of value predominate: (1) it is best to be white, and (2) it is worst to be black. Or, to put it in multiracial terms, it is best to be white, but when that fails, at least avoid being black at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the vantage of whiteness, this structure of logic is absolute. It is Manichaean (Gnostic) in the sense that it presents the world as comprised of &quot;objective&quot; material good and evil: there are people who are materially good and others who are evil, not by virtue of their behaviors, but because of who or what they are.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This divide does not produce a hierarchy of humanity; instead, it produces a finite schism between the realm of humanity (whites/Europe) and nonhumanity (blacks/Africa). In a Manichaean world, the black can only achieve equality among blacks--a particular and degraded contextuality--while the white finds his or her reference in the universality of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martinican anticolonialist Frantz Fanon wrote about how the modern world was formed first through sadistic aggression towards blacks (slavery and colonialism), a process which we have elaborated on in the sections above. For Fanon, this sadistic aggression is structural because without it &quot;white would not be white.&quot; But the official sanction against this violence in bourgeois democratic culture turns this structural violence into &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*257]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  impermissible knowledge--the knowledge of the necessity of black death for white life. As we reviewed in the section above, slave law is deeply grounded in the fraudulent ethics of violence and denial. This dual terror--violence and denial--also reveals the double movement that is at the heart of legal discourse in the antiblack world. In the post-Emancipation era, this ethic is reworked in a way that sutures the status of blacks as nonpersons to a rapidly changing legal landscape. We suggest that the appearance of an increasingly liberal terrain with regards to racial violence and the law in fact obfuscates the ongoing reality of antiblackness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formal emancipation of blacks from the social status of chattel was not a reality that whites could comprehend. Consequently, whites reserved a special place in their imaginations for the formerly enslaved subjects.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, the dream of slavery lives on at the level of desire and identification, the cultural dimension in which we have said it was most operative all along. Our analysis of slavery emphasized the symbolic economy precisely because it is this ethos that permits identifying slavery's afterlife in the symbols and signs that organize our society in the twenty-first century. In other words, the culture of white supremacy, deeply embedded in the seminal concepts of Western society, means that whiteness remains dependent upon the accumulation of black bodies in new and more complex ways. Two cultural codes took over from slavery: criminality and indebtedness. Both of these figures mark the zone of nonhumanity, demonstrating how, in the post-Emancipation era, the law retrenched antiblackness by simultaneously acknowledging and nullifying black people's new juridical status as free and equal citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment; the adoption of Black Codes; the institutions of convict leasing, sharecropping, and debt peonage; and the widespread practice of lynching together make up the complementary methods of recapturing the black body and suspending it in a state of permanent injury. These methods also represent the material structures of the legal and economic systems that forge the discursive connection &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*258]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  between blackness and criminality and form the basis for understanding the contemporary paradigm of policing. The Thirteenth Amendment simultaneously ended slavery in the generalized, formal sense and reconstituted it as the discrete point of reference for continued control over the freed people.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Codes racialized specific crimes such that they created crimes for which only black people could be &quot;duly convicted.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, Southern prisons were transformed from largely white to almost exclusively black, clearly marking a historical shift in the method of white domination and punishment of blacks from slavery to imprisonment.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As W.E.B. Du Bois explains in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">Black Reconstruction,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> there were no black convicts in the antebellum period since blacks were almost exclusively punished under the discipline of the plantation. After the war, however, the &quot;whole criminal system came to be used as a method of keeping Negroes at work and intimidating them. Consequently there began to be a demand for jails and penitentiaries beyond the natural demand due to the rise of crime.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These penitentiaries quickly swelled with black convicts.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process contributed to the racialization of crime itself, with criminality imputed to blackness. Frederick Douglass claimed that the tendency to &quot;impute crime to color&quot; meant that guilt was assigned to blacks as a group, regardless of the race of the perpetrator of a crime:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In certain parts of our country, when any white man wishes to commit a heinous offence, he wisely resorts to burnt cork and blackens his face and goes forth under the similitude of a Negro. When the deed is done, a little soap and water destroys his identity, and he goes unwhipt of justice. Some Negro is at once suspected and brought before the victim of wrong for identification, and there is never much trouble here, for as in the eyes of many white people, all Negroes look alike, and as the man arrested and who sits in the dock in irons is black, he is undoubtedly the criminal.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglass's point is a simple one: black criminality, like race itself, is premised upon the existence of a racial etiquette, where race becomes a &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*259]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;common sense&quot; way of comprehending, explaining, and acting in the world.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over a century after Douglass wrote this analysis of the criminalization of blackness, Katheryn Russell documented case data for sixty-seven racial hoaxes perpetrated between 1987 and 1996, including the notorious cases of Charles Stuart, Susan Smith, and Jesse Anderson.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russell noted that the majority of hoaxes involved whites who fabricated crimes against blacks; moreover, she noted that this data represents but a fraction of all racial hoax cases, since most hoaxes are not classified or reported as such. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">a priori</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criminalization of blackness is the necessary precursor to incarceration as a central tool of power over the black body. In Douglass's era, it made possible the spread of the convict lease system, in which black prisoners were leased as slaves to private industrialists or planters. As numerous analysts have pointed out, the economic incentive to abuse prisoners, to literally use them up, actually made the experience of convict leasing &quot;worse than slavery.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Black Codes that permitted criminal prosecution of freed people who did not fulfill their job contracts meant that the threat of penal slavery served to enforce the conditions of debt servitude, in which black farmers found themselves trapped during the post-Emancipation period. The prevailing legal and economic systems of the time--leasing, peonage, tenant farming, sharecropping, payment in scrip, racialized criminal law--mutually informed each other, and were determined by the ethos of slavery imbued into the criminal justice system, to produce a totalitarian effort at controlling the black body.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the present time, as in Douglass's day, the criminalization of blackness and the racialization of crime support a policy of mass imprisonment that complements extant changes in the global political economy that deepen, rather than ameliorate, black subjugation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emancipation was thus fatally paradoxical: it brought both a rupture in slavery and a reorganization of the plantation society. The antiblack world reconstructed the former slaves in terms of criminality in part because white society had so ritualistically cleansed its consciousness, via Emancipation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*260]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the systemic violence on which the society was based. As we discussed in the section above, the fact that, under slavery, the slave's humanity was denied--except for the purpose of criminal liability--points to the role of the law in the construction of antiblackness. As ritualized in one legal moment after another, the privilege to act with impunity is reserved for whites, while blacks are blameworthy for those same actions.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, the law participated in constructing the larger narrative about slavery as a benevolent institution, emphasizing the dependency and will-less-ness of the slave and the paternalism of the master. As Hartman has demonstrated in her work, within this narrative of the benign institution, the emancipated slave enters freedom beholden to benefactors, the former masters.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Africans were enslaved out of the moral responsibility of Europeans to civilize and protect blacks while benefiting from their labor as &quot;beasts of burden,&quot; then the horrors of slavery and its legacy fall on the shoulders of the freedperson. As solely culpable for the violence of slavery and its aftermath, the freedperson is then cast as indebted to whites for freedom itself. In this way, white supremacy absolves itself of its wrongdoings, thereby producing national innocence for the ongoing crimes of slavery. The freedperson is also held liable by white civil society for the very violence that necessitated the bloody remaking of the nation-state. The renewed forms of violent dispossession and premature death that the freedpersons encountered after Emancipation were thus seen as simply the burdens of freedom, the cross that the former slave must bear.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The specters of criminality and indebtedness thus ensnared blacks in the post-Emancipation era. White supremacy holds the former slave personally responsible for her own victimization, all while the legal and economic institutions that replaced slavery dispossess her of sovereignty and self-determination. This paradoxical process produces the criminal through racially specific social and historical processes--and yet casts her as individually liable. The shame and denigration this experience produces reflects the social devaluation of the criminal; in this context, we can see &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*261]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  how the experience of being socially dishonored and violated can manifest itself in violent behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynching remains the phenomenon from the Reconstruction era that provides the most paradigmatic illustration of how the phoenix of slavery rose from its legal ashes stronger than ever before. Lynching is the archetype for contemporary techniques of antiblack policing for three primary reasons. First, it provides cohesion for white civil society against the perceived threat of blackness, and enforces allegiance to white supremacy; second, gratuitous violence against black bodies is the language through which this solidarity is achieved; and third, it is the bridge between slavery and the contemporary prison industrial complex in terms of the impunity claimed by the police and white people's prerogative to ignore this antiblack violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reject the notion that lynching was simply the expression of white civil society and not a form of state terror; the fact that it was not officially organized by the state is merely a technical point made persuasive by the hegemony of the law.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, we have been analyzing the law in terms of actions, not simply what is written in legislative statutes. In this regard, then, the usual description of lynching as &quot;extra-legal,&quot; as in &quot;not regulated or sanctioned by law,&quot; has no purchase in our analysis. To the contrary, lynching was, in keeping with American-style contradictions, simultaneously illegal and legal. Torture, rape, and murder have always been illegal in this country, as have trial, conviction, and execution without due process.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These practices have long been permissible against blacks, of course, but that underscores the point, rather than overrules it: black bodies have always and already been seized, searched, tried, and convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our analysis, lynching is &quot;legal&quot; in two senses. First, it is conducted by whites with impunity, often by law enforcement itself. Second, lynching reveals the &quot;law&quot; of white supremacy governing U.S. society and mandating the bodily dispossession of all blacks in the face of white authority. That lynching was a socially customary practice that ultimately &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*262]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  became legal is most clearly seen in the impunity with which lynch mobs operated; in how law enforcement would aid and abet the actions of the mobs; in the high rates of membership by local and federal law enforcement personnel in the Ku Klux Klan; and in the manner in which lynching was eventually contained (not eliminated). Furthermore, the containment occurred through political pressure by the racial state on local elites who discouraged the practice amongst the white working class that did the heavy lifting of racial terror--</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by means of prosecuting perpetrators or prohibiting the practice through legislative fiat.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the fact that one of the most prominent manifestations of organized black resistance to racial rule during this era took the form of a campaign by black leaders for federal antilynching legislation supports our argument. It is not that the antilynching campaign, led by Ida B. Wells-Barnett and the NAACP, was not historically significant and did not produce important effects, because it achieved both of these things.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather, the point is that black opposition sought redress for injuries that were already simultaneously prohibited and permitted by law by petitioning the racial state for more law. This paradoxical quality to white supremacy was, and remains, essential to its operation. Although murder is illegal, the law permits, and indeed facilitates, white violence against blacks. The need for a specific legal prohibition against lynching simply underscores the degree to which the law does not recognize black humanity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The historical narrative of lynching as &quot;extra-legal,&quot; however, is most significant for what it tells us about lynching's crucial role in producing white solidarity. White society is rallied today through the amnesiac belief that lynching happened despite the law, not because of it. In this way, the law continues to work to bring white people together at the expense of blacks--in this case, by discursively isolating racism from the domain of law. This move is key to the contemporary culture of white supremacy and is most visible in terms of &quot;color-blindness&quot; ideology, an issue to which we will turn our attention momentarily. Today's public denial of lynching as &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*263]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  state terrorism recalls the ritualism that drove the practice historically. The lynch mob was an extension of the slave patrols central to the slavocracy prior to Emancipation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In writing about the slave patrols, renowned author and progressive activist Steve Martinot provides us with a critical lens through which to discern the meaning of lynching to white people.</SPAN></P>
<BR><P CLASS="c34"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[T]he patrols were more than merely a mode of policing. On the one hand, their potential violence as a control mechanism engendered an ethos of impunity that expressed itself as terror in the face of their operations. On the other, they appeared to the white population as the institution of peace and social tranquility. Terror and impunity toward black people constituted the materialization of white solidarity and tranquility, and white consensus in solidarity constituted the product of terror and impunity.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynching, too, produced social cohesion out of terrorism. The violence generated allegiance to white supremacy by conjuring the specter of social disorder; in so doing it indulged the parasitic fantasies of white society. In this way, lynching was instrumental in reproducing the culture of slavery after its official demise. Lynchings were public rituals that literally created white communal spaces: torture and killing of black people provided one of the few occasions when the class divisions of white society were overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1882 and 1946, there were at least five thousand recorded lynchings in the United States, almost one every three days (in February 1893, there was practically one lynching per day).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, this figure only just begins to embody the violence directed against black communities. White mobs attacked blacks throughout the country during this period, leading to numerous race riots and thousands of deaths.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all cases, this violence against black people has been gratuitous: although the pretexts for this violence varied--fictional black rapists,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revenge for perceived affronts to white superiority,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n136</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> competition over jobs,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n137</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and suppression of black voting rights,  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n138</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to name a few--it was all in response to nothing but black existence.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n139</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the realm of white mob violence, the &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*264]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law as legal discourse and disciplinary practice subtends the symbolic arena; in this regard, lynching teaches us that policing is profoundly psychological, reinforcing the authority of white power.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n140</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In lynching, then, we see the constituent elements of modern policing: impunity, solidarity, terror, and public bodies fungible for white civic pleasure. Since a basic indicator of social parasitism is when one group's pain is another group's pleasure, we should recall the words of Richard Wright and Cornel West, cited earlier: black death provides the very conditions of possibility for white life.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n141</SUP></SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. CONCLUSION: WHITES ON THE LOOSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the Jena case, this combined ethic of parasitism, fraud, and white solidarity--fundamental to white supremacy and deeply engrained in U.S. culture--continues to inform the intrinsic political and psychological structures of this society. In Jena, the hanging of the nooses was widely dismissed by whites as a youthful prank, akin to putting toilet paper on a person's front yard or shaving cream on a car.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n142</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the high school principal wanted to expel the three youth, the school's superintendent reduced their charges on the basis that their prank was nothing more than a tasteless joke. Their reward for such parasitic violence was simple: after three days suspension, they were back at school. Barbara Murphy, a white resident of Jena, expressed the viewpoint of much of the white community that saw no connection between the nooses and racial hatred, nor between racism and the criminal charges against the six black students:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't have a race problem. It's not black against white. It's crime. The nooses? I don't even know why they were there, what they were supposed to mean. There's pranks all the time, of one type or another, going on. And it just didn't seem to be racist to me.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n143</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial violence, of course, is rarely recognized as such by the persecuting society. In the contemporary period, the parasitic relation between white &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*265]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and black, &quot;with black folk the indispensable sacrificial lamb&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n144</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vital for the sustenance of white civil society, is strictly impermissible knowledge.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n145</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This denial on the part of whites is not merely psychological or cultural--it is structural. In the post-civil rights era of formal legal equality, the State's official policy of colorblindness  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n146</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would evaporate as so much hot air were it not for white people, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">en masse,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disavowing the continued centrality of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people in Jena, of course, read the racist violence inherent in the hanging nooses. Robert Bailey, one of the Jena Six, illuminates the parasitism represented by the nooses:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c36"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in the early morning. I seen them hanging. I'm thinking the KKK, you know, were hanging nooses. They want to hang somebody. Real nooses, the ones you see on TV are the kind of nooses they were, the ones they play in the movies and they were hanging all the people, you know, and the thing dropped, those were the kind of nooses they were. I know it was somebody white that hung the nooses in the tree. You know, I don't know another way to put it, but, you know, I was disappointed, because, you know, we do little pranks--you know, toilet paper, that's a prank, you know what I'm saying? Paper all over the square, all the pranks they used to do, that's pranks. Nooses hanging there--nooses ain't no prank.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n147</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caseptla Bailey, Robert's mother, specifically addressed how the violence of the message is connected to actual violence against black bodies:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c36"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It meant hatred, to the other race. It meant that &quot;We're going to kill you, you're going to die.&quot; You know, it sent a message: &quot;This is not the place for you to sit. This is not your damn tree. Do not sit here. You know, you ought to remain in your place, know your place and stay in your place. You're out of your boundaries.&quot; And the first thing now that the sheriff department or that the chief of police want to say that--as well as the superintendent--one had nothing to do with the other. Now, come on now!  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n148</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*266]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Caseptla Bailey so clearly puts it, black bodily dispossession remains a reality today; raw life is still the mark of the age. This pilfering of black sovereignty is literally a source of white entertainment. The June 1998 lynching of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, by three white men who dragged Byrd from the back of their pickup truck for miles until his head separated from his body, not only underscores in horrific fashion Bailey's assessment of the violence faced by blacks in Jena, but provided the occasion to see white people having fun. Within a week of Byrd's murder, there were reports of copycat crimes: in Louisiana, three white men taunted a black man with racial epithets while trying to drag him alongside their car; in Illinois, three white boys assaulted a black teenager in almost exactly the same way; in New York City three months later, where police officers and firefighters parodied Byrd's lynching by imitating it in a Labor Day parade float; and in Washington, D.C., while Byrd's killers were under trial, a radio announcer responded to a clip from a song by Lauryn Hill by commenting, &quot;No wonder people drag them behind trucks.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n149</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jokes and mimicry surround incidents of racial violence in ways that confound representation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n150</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also shows how the distance of time and space do little to hinder the pedagogy of racial violence from reproducing its lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jena Six case itself occasioned its own period of mimicry. In November 2007, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">New York Times</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported that since the huge September twentieth rally in Jena, where tens of thousands protested racism in the criminal justice system, there have been as many as fifty to sixty &quot;noose incidents.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n151</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That same month, hundreds of people gathered in Charleston, West Virginia, to call for hate-crime charges in the case of Megan Williams, a young black woman who was beaten, tortured, and sexually assaulted for days in a remote trailer by six white people.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n152</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Vitello, writing in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c35">New York Times,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> questioned whether these hate crimes were &quot;part of some new homegrown vernacular of race hate.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n153</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems more likely, however, that incidents such as the Jena Six case (or the murder of James Byrd) give permission to others to express in a more &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*267]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  dramatic fashion what is already alive and well at the level of the banal and everyday. We occasion this permitted conduct not to a new form of race hate, as Vitello suggests, but to an extension of a racially ordinary past in legal memory. In other words, what matters is not the new social terrain upon which we confront the racial disposition of the black body today, but instead, the manner in which we have failed to establish a legal system that could remove black punishment from its racial safekeeping. Chester Himes once wrote that &quot;yesterday will make you cry.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n154</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We would add that tomorrow will bring tears as well, since yesterday continues to shape the psychological, social, legal, and political structures of our society. This is one of the many lessons available to us through the Jena Six.</SPAN></P>

There are three elements that received varying emphasis in the conglomeration of Lousiana's assault and battery statutes: (1) the type of weapon used; (2) the seriousness of the injury inflicted; and (3) the specific intent with which the act was done. An assault or battery with intent to commit a specific crime contains all the elements of and necessarily includes an attempt to commit that crime. The only distinction between an assault or battery with specific intent and an attempt is that an offender may be guilty of an attempt where his overt act falls short of constituting a battery, or is even so remote as not to constitute an assault.</SPAN></P>

To put it another way, the majority of the world, for the majority of human history, has developed notions of property that are invested in the collective, or the commons. Western society has been the anomaly in this regard: it alone has conjured the notion of private property. The different conceptions of property ownership are an expression of prevailing individual human relations. We can see this distinction through the differing notions of freedom: western society is unique in claiming the individual &quot;free&quot; when s/he is unfettered by social ties; the rest of the world has regarded this situation as akin to death. Notions of &quot;freedom,&quot; therefore, are socially constructed and thus grounded in particular historical and cultural contexts.

For instance, these differences can be based in language, religion, geography, or family relations. Racism is a specific form of racialism whereby these differences are fatally coupled with power and located in a visual economy, such as skin color, in such a way that it &quot;creates or reproduces structures of domination based on essentialist categories of race.&quot; MICHAEL OMI &amp; HOWARD WINANT, RACIAL FORMATION IN THE UNITED STATES: FROM THE 1960S TO THE 1990S 71 (Routledge 1994).

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c37"><SPAN CLASS="c31">n75&nbsp; This point is not without debate, including the perspective that white Europeans were subjected to enslavement as much, if not more so, than were Africans. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See, e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> DON JORDAN &amp; MICHAEL WALSH, WHITE CARGO: THE FORGOTTEN HISTORY OF BRITAIN'S WHITE SLAVES IN AMERICA (N.Y. Univ. Press 2008) (2007). We find this argument unconvincing. For instance, in Jordan and Walsh's book, the authors argue that slavery applies to any person bought and sold, whether for a decade or a lifetime, and therefore the historiography on &quot;indentured servitude&quot; minimizes the severity of white bondage. Although perhaps a useful definition for a comparative study of slavery across time and space </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">(a la</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> Orlando Patterson), this perspective simplifies transatlantic slavery by vacating the noneconomic, or supra-economic, dimensions of trans-Atlantic slavery. In other words, white supremacy's reliance upon the enslaved black body was less about the profit requirements of global capitalism and more about how Western society imagines itself in relation to its racialized Other. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> FANON, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> note 35; LEWIS GORDON, HER MAJESTY'S OTHER CHILDREN: SKETCHES OF RACISM FROM A NEOCOLONIAL AGE 76 (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers 1997) (explaining and defining &quot;white&quot; reliance upon &quot;black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c31">The effort to equate the capture and systemic oppression of the working classes in Europe and North America with transatlantic slavery does not do justice to the suffering of white &quot;slaves&quot;--it merely further obfuscates the central role of white supremacy in the long-standing subordination of these working classes. Other scholars attempt a similar argument about the enslavement of white Europeans and Americans in the context of the Mediterranean. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> WHITE SLAVES, AFRICAN MASTERS: AN ANTHOLOGY OF AMERICAN CAPTIVITY NARRATIVES (Paul Baepler ed., Univ. of Chicago Press 1999); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> ROBERT C. DAVIS, CHRISTIAN SLAVES, MUSLIM MASTERS: WHITE SLAVERY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, THE BARBARY COAST, AND ITALY, 1500-1800 (2004). Davis asserts that during the period 1500-1650 African enslavement of white Christians exceeded the European enslavement of Africans and that marauding Muslim corsairs (pirates) wrought greater destruction and depopulation along the Spanish and Italian coasts than what European slavers would later inflict on the African interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c31">Again, although the practices documented by Davis and others certainly occurred, there is a larger context that renders the comparison to transatlantic slavery unsuccessful and unhelpful. For example, Peter Lamborn Wilson's study of the Muslim corsairs from the Barbary Coast points out that thousands of Europeans converted to Islam and joined the pirate &quot;holy war&quot; against the rising bourgeois states of Europe and the persecuting societies of Christiandom, creating &quot;insurrectionary communities.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See, e.g.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> PETER LAMBORN WILSON, PIRATE UTOPIAS: MOORISH CORSAIRS &amp; EUROPEAN RENEGADOES (Autonomedia 2003).

Although affirmative action is a complex issue that warrants more thorough treatment than we can provide here, we can briefly point to some of the ways that whites articulate their political resistance to the policy in personal terms. For instance, the frequently evoked sentiment that a &quot;less qualified&quot; black candidate received the position over a &quot;more deserving&quot; white candidate is essentially whites internalizing, and simultaneously insulating themselves from, the structural reality of institutional racism. They internalize it in the sense that they take the current arrangement of resources to be the outcome of something inside of them, reflective of their characters and their merits as individuals, rather than the outcome of white privilege. In so doing, they are distancing themselves psychologically from the ongoing reality of historical inequities. As a result, the offense they experience when they perceive that they have been passed over by a &quot;less qualified&quot; black candidate is fundamentally racist in its meaning, but equally impossible for them to see as such.</SPAN></P>

Although it is beyond the scope of this article, it should be noted here that the origins of black bodily dispossession in the contemporary period lies with the fundamental alienation from labor and land solidified through the post-Emancipation legal regime. As Jeff Kerr-Ritchie points out, the freedpeople were very clear as to what they wanted their relationship to the land to become after slavery. The sentiments of freedpeople from the Georgia Sea Islands in testimony to Congress in 1865: &quot;Cotton is no good for nigger. Corn good for nigger; ground nuts good for nigger; cotton good for massa; if massa want cotton he may make it himself, cotton do nigger no good; cotton make nigger perish.&quot; Kerr-Ritchie reminds us that former slaves throughout the diaspora exhibited a profound distaste for cash crop production: in independent Haiti and British Jamaica, freedpeople had sought subsistence over cash crop economies, with many former slaves becoming small peasant farmers as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c31">It was this orientation that made the freedpeople a major obstacle to restoring the cotton economy after the Civil War, and directly contributed to them not receiving the promised forty acres and a mule. The loss of the land, in other words, is an extension of the loss of sovereignty over oneself; this dispossession is refracted in the law, which made it possible for whites to become the major beneficiaries of the &quot;forty acres and a mule&quot; supposedly intended for the former slaves. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> Jeffrey Kerr-Ritchie, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">Forty Acres, or, An Act of Bad Faith,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> THE NEW BLACK RENAISSANCE: THE SOULS ANTHOLOGY OF CRITICAL AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES 25-39 (Manning Marable et al., eds., Paradign Publishers 2005).</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><BR><P CLASS="c37"><SPAN CLASS="c31">n123&nbsp; Perhaps the best modern example of the black-white disparity in criminal blameworthiness resides in the ongoing debate centered on the disparity in crack versus powder cocaine sentencing. Although different forms of the same drug, crack and powder cocaine, have the same effects on the brain and nervous system. Federal law, however, sets a one hundred to one sentencing disparity between the two forms. This means that the distrubution of just five grams of crack cocaine (a thimble full) yields a five-year mandatory minimum, while it takes five hundred grams of powder cocaine to trigger the same five-year sentence. The sentencing disparity, enacted in 1986 at the height of drug war hysteria, was based largely on the myth that crack cocaine was more dangerous than powder cocaine and that it was instantly addictive and caused violent behavior, a distinction now disproven by copious amounts of scientific evidence. The impact of this disparity on black-white blameworthiness is devastating. For example, in 2006, 82 percent of those sentenced under federal crack cocaine laws were black, and only 8.8 percent were white--even though more than two-thirds of people who use crack are white. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">See</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> U.S. SENTENCING COMM'N, SPECIAL REPORT TO CONGRESS: COCAINE AND FEDERAL SENTENCING POLICY 16 (2007); </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> Bob Paynter, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">If You're Arrested for Drugs, You're More Likely to Receive a Second Chance if You're White,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> THE CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER REPORTER, Oct. 19, 2008, http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/10/race_and_drug_use.html (providing an excellent example of the impact of this disparity).</SPAN></P>

Buttigieg ed., Columbia Univ. Press 1992) (1972). We should elaborate on our use of the concept &quot;hegemony&quot; in the context of the Jena 6. The Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci is often referenced by analysts seeking to explain the nature of political struggle in a bourgeois democracy such as the United States. The Left persistently seeks guidance from Gramsci's study of &quot;hegemony&quot; to explain how state/capital formations are insulated from contestation by the institutions of civil society (e.g., schools, media, churches, social services, entertainment) that appear to spontaneously perform the bidding of the ruling class. According to Gramsci's notion of hegemony, what appears to be spontaneous is in fact a product of political struggle in which consent is manufactured by intellectuals of the ruling class, backed up by &quot;coercion-in-reserve.&quot; In this vein, the law is a key instrument in the winning of consent: the production of &quot;common sense&quot; about the law--for example, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">that it exists as the last barrier against chaos, and as such, represents everyone's interests</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31">--is a primary means by which civil society participates in its own subordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c33"><SPAN CLASS="c31">Unfortunately, Gramsci's insights are limited in their applicability to a social context predicated on slavery. As Frank Wilderson explains, Gramsci's assumptive logic posits &quot;that all subjects are positioned in such a way as to have their consent solicited and to, furthermore, be able to extend their consent 'spontaneously,&quot; Wilderson, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">supra</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> note 27, at 5. In a slave society, and one such as ours based in slavery's ongoing relations of force, there is no valency of position for blacks and whites. While whites may have their consent solicited in various ways by the institutions of state, capital, and civil society, with coercion only as a contingency, a reverse process has applied to blacks. Direct relations of force, both state violence and the deregulated violence of white civil society, have always preceded the manufacturing of consent when it comes to blacks. In other words, hegemony is not a useful concept for explaining the black experience. So when we observe above that the popular belief that lynching was not a form of state-sanctioned terror is only sustained by the hegemony of the law, we are referring to law's hegemonic relationship to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">white</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> civil society. We make this argument in the context of our discussion in Section II, where we sought to situate the central tropes of western legal discourse (freedom, the individual, and private property), showing that historical development of these concepts occurred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c38">through</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c31"> the capture of black people, and that within the U.S. legal tradition, the rule of law developed through the myth of consent.</SPAN></P>

To that extent, each type of risk prioritization can be seen as in careful balance with the other: enough protection of the innocent in the court system, despite the risk that some guilty people will be acquitted, is balanced by enough room for self-defense to prohibit potential crime victims from being attacked, despite the risk that some non-criminals will be shot.  ...

False-Negative Minimization: Self-Defense Laws Self-defense laws have the opposite error-risk prioritizations from the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt rules; self-defense laws minimize false negatives by tolerating some false positives.  ... A self-defense rule that prefers false-negative to false-positive errors (such as the type of rule that operates in the courtroom) would give self-defenders very little latitude to make mistakes; self-defense would be justified only when the self-defender could be certain (say, beyond a reasonable doubt) that he needed to use deadly force to protect himself or his home.  ... Specifically, policy-makers should consider the impact of increasingly permissive gun laws on the risk of erroneous defensive shootings and how that risk plays into not only the moral equation but also public confidence in the justice system and in law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Terry walked into a Shoney's restaurant in Anniston, Alabama, expecting nothing more than a quick meal. Instead, he found himself face-to-face with two armed robbers, crazed gunmen who had terrorized the other restaurant patrons, and were working themselves into a frenzy, on the verge of an orgy of violence. Only then did Terry pull the concealed .45-caliber handgun Alabama law allowed him to carry. The thugs fired, one of them grazing Terry's hip. Terry's aim was more sure. He shot one of the armed robbers to death, and wounded the other to a degree that took him out of the fight. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n2</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> When Terry fired his gun, he took (at least hypothetically) a risk that those he perceived to be attackers would turn out to be innocent, that they would be shot in error. Of course, the risk of error seems quite low here, as the &quot;crazed gunmen&quot; seemed unmistakably out to cause harm; indeed, Terry's decision to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*570]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  shoot turned out not to have been in error. Nonetheless, the risk that he might have been wrong was present, however low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, consider the example of homeowner Rodney Peairs, who took the same risk and turned out to be wrong. In October 1992, Yoshihiro Hattori, a Japanese exchange student who was living in Louisiana, and an American friend approached the home of Peairs, looking for a Halloween party. When Peairs's wife opened the door, she was frightened by the boys in costume and yelled for Peairs to get his gun. Hattori did not understand Peairs's command to freeze, so Peairs shot and killed him. The next year, Peairs was acquitted in a criminal trial (though a civil case did award damages to the victim's family). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n3</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both of these instances, a citizen lawfully shot a perceived attacker in self-defense. In the first, the perception of danger turned out to have been correct. In the second, the perception was incorrect, and an innocent person was shot. Critically, however, the self-defense law provided that no crime was committed by either shooter because both reasonably believed themselves to be in danger. Self-defense law privileges the risk that an innocent non-criminal like Hattori will be erroneously perceived to be an attacker and therefore shot over the risk that criminals like the Alabama gunmen will be allowed to commit their crimes uninterrupted. This Note argues that these error-risk calculations are inherently relevant to permissive gun laws and thus must be considered when evaluating the propriety and effectiveness of those laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this Note, I examine the error risk inherent in two different environments of crime prevention and punishment: the operation of criminal courts after the commission of a crime and personal self-defense with guns to prevent a crime from occurring. Indeed, the two have been compared academically before:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun use by private citizens against violent criminals and burglars is common and about as frequent as legal actions like arrests, is a more prompt negative consequence of crime than legal punishment, and is more severe, at its most serious, than legal system punishments... . Serious predatory criminals perceive a risk from victim gun use that is roughly comparable to that of criminal justice system actions ... . </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n4</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> This Note looks at conviction on the one hand and defensive shootings on the other as two ways those suspected of causing harm to others are ultimately judged, where the risk of error has the greatest consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*571]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I argue that laws protecting the innocent against criminal conviction and laws allowing individuals to protect themselves from criminal attack prioritize opposite types of risk. To that extent, each type of risk prioritization can be seen as in careful balance with the other: enough protection of the innocent in the court system, despite the risk that some guilty people will be acquitted, is balanced by enough room for self-defense to prohibit potential crime victims from being attacked, despite the risk that some non-criminals will be shot. If one assumes the status quo to generate a particular balance of these risks, change in the relevant laws creates change in the balance. Specifically, more permissive gun laws facilitate the exercise of self-defense (at the expense of the safety of perceived attackers) and therefore put a finger on the self-defense side of the error-risk scale. The current debate over the correlation between guns and crime should consider that disruption before drawing normative conclusions about the benefit of these laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Note proceeds as follows: Part I briefly examines current gun use in America and the literature on the purported causal connection between gun laws and crime rates. Part II sets up the theoretical landscape of my argument by explaining the concept of error risk in greater detail. Part III turns this lens on two techniques that minimize false positives: reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence. Part IV looks at rules on the other side of the error-risk calculus: the false-negative-minimizing self-defense rules. Part V then integrates the right-to-carry and shoot-in-self-defense laws into the error-risk picture that has been drawn. The Note concludes by considering the importance of error-risk analysis to policy makers considering not only gun laws but any other decision-making regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Guns, Crime, and Scholarship<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Before delving into the error-risk analysis that forms the basis for this Note's argument, it is valuable to briefly survey the landscape of gun use in America and the legal literature that analyzes it. The arguments presented in this literature are essential to understanding both the significance of gun laws and the gaps in current scholarly analysis of legal defensive killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Guns in America<BR>&nbsp;<BR> By today's best estimates, there are at least 200 million firearms in the hands of American civilians. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n5</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Across the political and ideological spectrum, it is widely agreed that the primary reason Americans keep guns is for self- &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*572]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  protection. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n6</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exact number of annual defensive gun uses is harder to estimate. The government-sponsored National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) has found that guns are used in self-defense approximately 108,000 times per year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n7</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though this number is the subject of some debate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n8</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By every estimate, however, the point for purposes of this Note holds: many Americans keep guns and use them for self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, most defensive gun uses involve merely brandishing or threatening to shoot a gun without any shots being fired. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n9</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, even ardent gun-rights advocates acknowledge that, &quot;although shootings of criminals represent a small fraction of defensive uses of guns, Americans nevertheless shoot criminals with a frequency that must be regarded as remarkable by any standard.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n10</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No national data exists on the frequency of legal defensive killings, though Gary Kleck has attempted to extrapolate estimates from local statistics, concluding that there are between 10,000 and 20,000 legal shootings of criminals - or at least those perceived to be criminals - per year. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n11</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Note takes a theoretical look at these cases of defensive shootings from an error-risk perspective &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*573]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to claim they must become a bigger part of any policy debate about gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. The Guns and Crime Debate<BR>&nbsp;<BR> To date, the vast literature on the connection between private gun ownership and crime rates has focused on whether there is a positive or negative correlation between the former and the latter, or whether there is any correlation at all. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n12</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jens Ludwig and Philip Cook, who have written extensively on the issue, note that though there is widespread acknowledgement that guns have beneficial effects on crime prevention, a debate remains:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is in dispute is the magnitude of these [positive] effects and their implications for public policy. How often do victims succeed in using a gun to avoid serious injury? To what extent does the private ownership of guns serve as a deterrent to violence? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n13</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> These questions are significant because if the magnitude of crime prevention is small in comparison to the negative costs of permissive gun laws - for example, frequent erroneous defensive shootings or accidental injuries - then policy-makers might conclude that the crime-prevention benefits are not worth the risk of widespread gun ownership. It is the empirical questions about the magnitude of the correlation between guns and crime that have been at the heart of much of the guns and crime literature thus far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand, a group of scholars argues that empirical evidence supports the theory that private gun ownership reduces crime because it deters criminals. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n14</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As John Lott, one of the most prominent (and controversial) writers &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*574]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the field, claims, &quot;when crime becomes more difficult, less crime is committed.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n15</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has analyzed data on guns and crime and concludes that &quot;allowing citizens to carry concealed handguns reduces violent crimes, and the reductions coincide very closely with the number of concealed-handgun permits issued.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n16</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lott also concludes that &quot;mass shootings in public places are reduced when law-abiding citizens are allowed to carry concealed handguns.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n17</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, a proven deterrent effect may support not only the argument that permissive gun laws are a good idea, but also the argument that they are morally obligatory. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n18</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other scholars line up behind Lott and make similar arguments about the relationship between guns and crime. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n19</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squaring off against Lott and his supporters is a group of scholars who argue not only that Lott's empirical analysis is flawed, but also that the Lott side fails to consider ways in which murder rates can increase through the passage of shall-issue laws </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n20</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;even if no permit holder ever commits a crime.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n21</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor John J. Donohue explains:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*575]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, knowing that members of the public are armed may encourage criminals to carry guns and use them more quickly, resulting in more felony murders. Second, ... the massive theft of guns each year means that anything that increases the number of guns in America will likely increase the flow of guns into the hands of criminals, who may use them to commit murders. Notably, the typical gun permit holder is a middle-aged Republican white male, which is a group at relatively low risk of violent criminal victimization with or without gun ownership, so it is not clear whether substantial crime reduction benefits are likely to occur by arming this group further. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n22</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Donohue analyzes both of these hypotheses from an empirical perspective, and concludes that it is impossible to draw a causal conclusion about the effect of the passage of gun laws on crime rates. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n23</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authors also consider other ways in which gun ownership may increase gun violence without affecting crime rates - namely through accidental shootings </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n24</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and suicides. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n25</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aside from select anecdotes such as the story of the unfortunate trick-or-treater, Hattori, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n26</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discussions about the significance of the gun owner who legally shoots in self-defense, injuring or killing his potential assailant, are largely absent from any discussion in the current literature on gun laws and crime rates. Because the law permits such a gun owner to use his gun to &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*576]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  protect himself, he has committed no crime, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n27</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and yet the number of deaths or injuries due to guns increases every time one of these shootings occurs. Of course, if one assumes that the self-defender's judgment that he was in danger was correct, this injury can be viewed as merely a replacement - the injured assailant rather than the injured victim - and a replacement that society might well tolerate comfortably. But the correctness of the self-defender's judgment is not guaranteed; indeed, there are myriad tragic anecdotes about incorrect self-defense shootings. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n28</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is this error risk that I argue must be considered in any discussion attempting to examine the connection between guns and crime. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n29</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*577]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. An Overview of Error-Risk Minimization<BR>&nbsp;<BR> The idea that society prefers to release the guilty than imprison the innocent is at the heart of the operation of our criminal courts. It is this axiomatic principle that undergirds the error-minimization system governing standards for convictions and prosecutions, and it is this principle that I suggest is in tension with right-to-carry laws (and other permissive gun laws).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists refer to two types of errors: false positives (which are sometimes called type-1 errors) and false negatives (which are sometimes called type-2 errors). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n30</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These errors can be understood as a measure of the effectiveness of any decision in achieving its goal. If the goal of the decision-maker is to correctly identify fact X, a false positive will diagnose the fact as present when it is not, while a false negative will diagnose the fact as absent when it is really present. In the criminal courts, the goal can be understood as the conviction of the guilty party. Thus, a false-positive conviction error would be the erroneous conviction of an innocent man, and a false-negative conviction error would be the erroneous acquittal of a guilty one. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n31</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, when someone shoots in self-defense, her goal can be understood as the successful prevention of a crime. She makes a false-positive error if she shoots someone who is not actually an assailant and a false-negative error if she fails to shoot someone who is. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n32</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When any decision is made, the decision-maker risks either a false-positive or false-negative error. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n33</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This holds true in the legal system as it chooses one side over another. As the Supreme Court has pointed out, &quot;there is always in litigation a margin of error, representing error in fact-finding, which both parties must take into account.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n34</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, consideration of the error-risk inherent in any given decision becomes part of the deliberative process. Throughout history, legal systems have been built around the notion that, when it comes to the government depriving citizens of life, liberty, property, or even reputation, false-negative errors are preferable to false-positive errors. In other words, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*578]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as Blackstone said, &quot;it is better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n35</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This idea did not originate with Blackstone. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n36</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the same principle can be traced back to ancient civilizations, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n37</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though the number of guilty men at risk varies depending on context and commentator. This varying number of guilty men - what Alexander Volokh has referred to as the &quot;n guilty men&quot; principle </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n38</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - can be seen as a measurement of society's false-negative-error tolerance. A brief survey of the historical use of the n guilty men principle shows that, though the level of tolerance varies, society has long been concerned with avoiding false-positive errors. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n39</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the magnitude of the &quot;n guilty men&quot; principle is a subject of dispute - how many guilty men is it worth releasing to avoid the conviction of one innocent - the idea that such a ratio exists is pervasive. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n40</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And indeed it has been built into the structure of our criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*579]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. False-Positive Minimization: Presumption of Innocence and Reasonable Doubt<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Society's preference for false-negative to false-positive errors where matters of life and liberty are at stake can be seen clearly in two important elements of the criminal prosecutions: the presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to presume a suspect innocent can be understood as the first in a series of decisions that are made in a criminal prosecution. In establishing the default rule for the consideration of an accusation, the accused can be presumed to be innocent or guilty. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n41</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he is presumed innocent, the government bears the burden of proving him guilty; should it not he will be acquitted. The presumption of innocence incurs the risk that a guilty man will be acquitted (a false-negative error). Conversely, if we presumed the accused to be guilty, the defendant would bear the burden of establishing his own innocence; should he not, he would be convicted. Under a presumption-of-guilt system, the risk would be of false-positive errors - the chance that an innocent man will be found guilty is increased. Thus, because we prefer false-negative to false-positive errors, we choose the default rule that risks false-negative over false-positive errors: presuming innocence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n42</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court has held that &quot;the principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n43</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although this was not expressed explicitly until 1895, the Court noted that the roots of the presumption are deep: &quot;it is stated as unquestioned in the text-books, and has been referred to as a matter of course in the decisions of this court and in the courts of the several States.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n44</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the presumption of innocence is perhaps more deeply ingrained in our justice system than the reasonable doubt standard, the two are error-risk &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*580]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  parallels. The reasonable doubt standard &quot;provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n45</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and it similarly operates on the principle of minimizing false-positive errors. The Supreme Court has said in no uncertain terms that &quot;the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n46</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The purpose of the standard, as the Court put it, is &quot;to safeguard men from dubious and unjust convictions, with resulting forfeitures of life, liberty and property.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n47</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the Court does not say so explicitly, its explanation for the reasonable doubt standard lies in a statement that false-positive errors should be avoided. The Court identifies the costs associated with a false positive - &quot;the possibility that he may lose his liberty ... and the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n48</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and finds them too great to overcome reasonable doubt. In order to minimize the risk that a defendant will be erroneously deprived of his liberty (even though he has been granted due process of law), the burden of proof is placed on the government rather than the individual </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n49</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and is raised to a level that balances the defendant's &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*581]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  interest in his liberty against the government and society's interest in convicting the guilty. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n50</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Harlan provided the most direct examination of the reasonable doubt standard as an error-minimization technique in his Winship concurrence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n51</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He opined that &quot;the choice of the standard for a particular variety of adjudication does, I think, reflect a very fundamental assessment of the comparative social costs of erroneous factual determinations.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n52</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More specifically, he explained:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standard of proof influences the relative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes [conviction of the innocent and acquittal of the guilty]. If, for example, the standard of proof for a criminal trial were a preponderance of the evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, there would be a smaller risk of factual errors that result in freeing guilty persons, but a far greater risk of factual errors that result in convicting the innocent. Because the standard of proof affects the comparative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes, the choice of the standard to be applied in a particular kind of litigation should, in a rational world, reflect an assessment of the comparative social disutility of each. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n53</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The United States criminal justice system is framed around the belief that &quot;the disutility of convicting an innocent person far exceeds the disutility of finding a guilty person to be not guilty.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n54</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, in criminal cases, where the life, liberty, and reputation of the accused may be at stake, the reasonable doubt standard is not only necessary to protect against erroneous deprivation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n55</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but it is also &quot;indispensable to command the respect and confidence of the community.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n56</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This latter point is crucial: the reasonable doubt standard and the presumption of innocence protect not only the accused against erroneous deprivation, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*582]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but also the general populous against fear of the criminal courts. As the Court put it, &quot;it is critical that the moral force of the criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof that leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being condemned.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n57</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A standard that properly balances the interests of the accused against the interests of the prosecution helps people have confidence that the justice system will keep them safe not only from criminals but also from the government. The Court explained: &quot;It is also important in our free society that every individual going about his ordinary affairs have confidence that his government cannot adjudge him guilty of a criminal offense without convincing a proper factfinder of his guilt with utmost certainty.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n58</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The principle of public confidence in the system is one to which this Note returns later in discussing the psychosocial influence of right-to-carry laws. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n59</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though I have argued above that the American justice system structurally and theoretically prioritizes false negatives over false positives, this does not mean that Americans are satisfied in any particular case with the acquittal of a person believed to be guilty. Indeed, particularly visible or contentious acquittals, such as O.J. Simpson's, can dramatically shake the public's faith in the criminal justice system. Commentators have noted that &quot;the O.J. Simpson case is troublesome because it placed the criminal justice system ... on trial along with the accused.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n60</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day the Simpson verdict was announced, the nation stood still waiting for the jury's decision, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n61</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and when it came down, outrage was widespread. The Los Angeles Times found that, after the Simpson verdict, seventy percent of local residents had &quot;only some&quot; or &quot;very little&quot; confidence in the criminal justice system. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n62</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some sense, the outrage at the Simpson verdict suggests that the public believes that the false-positive minimization system is unsatisfactory. Here, people were widely horrified that a man they believed to be guilty was set free based on reasonable doubt, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n63</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even if those rules are in place to protect innocent &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*583]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  men from being convicted. However, the Simpson example can be explained at least partly by the extraordinary nature of the case. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n64</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More importantly, the public reaction to the Simpson verdict does not undermine the greater point that, despite fury or frustration at individual verdicts, the system works because of its structural mechanisms for preventing errors in general and particularly false positives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significantly, the reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence standards have not narrowed over time, nor do they currently appear to be narrowing even in the face of public reaction to cases like Simpson's. We have not seen, for example, the relaxation of the reasonable doubt standard to the one used in civil cases, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n65</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under which Simpson was found liable for the murders. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n66</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The courtroom side of the criminal justice system remains one that strongly prefers false negatives to false positives, as exemplified by the presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*584]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, it is possible that increasingly permissive self-defense laws, described below, are themselves the structural response to public dissatisfaction with the false-positive-minimizing courtroom protections. As the next Section describes, self-defense laws demonstrate a societal conclusion that there is more social utility to allowing false positives than prioritizing false negatives when the imminent bodily harm of an innocent person is at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. False-Negative Minimization: Self-Defense Laws<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Self-defense laws have the opposite error-risk prioritizations from the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt rules; self-defense laws minimize false negatives by tolerating some false positives. While a comprehensive examination of self-defense rules is beyond the scope of this Note, a brief overview will suffice to understand the way self-defense plays into the error-risk picture painted above. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n67</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Part summarizes the self-defense rules, and then turns to a discussion of the error-risk prioritizations of self-defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-defense carves out an exception to the general rules that people are not allowed to use force against one another. Wayne LaFave provides a simple and concise summary of the law of self-defense in criminal law:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One who is not the aggressor in an encounter is justified in using a reasonable amount of force against his adversary when he reasonably believes (a) that he is in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from his adversary and (b) that the use of such force is necessary to avoid this danger. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n68</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*585]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This rule applies to all force and all threats, as long as the two are proportional. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n69</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the context of gun use, the force is often deadly force. In these circumstances, the proportionality rule is especially strict (at least in the abstract); it is generally impermissible to use deadly force to defend against non-deadly threats, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n70</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> except to protect one's home (or &quot;castle&quot;), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n71</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or to effect a &quot;lawful arrest.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n72</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the Model Penal Code prohibits the use of deadly force where &quot;the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n73</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the exception that no one is &quot;obliged to retreat from his dwelling or place of work.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n74</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how exactly does the rule of self-defense play into error risk calculus? Just as in the criminal prosecution scenario discussed above, the decision to use self-defense necessarily involves the risk that the decision-maker will be wrong about the facts. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n75</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the courtroom scenario, the zero-one decision is convict or acquit; in a self-defense situation, the zero-one decision is defend (with force) or do not. In the courtroom, a false-positive error occurs when an innocent man is convicted; in cases of self-defense, a false-positive error occurs when a self-defender erroneously assumes that another person poses an imminent danger and uses force against the perceived attacker. Conversely, in the courtroom, a false-negative error is the acquittal of a guilty man. With self-defense, a false-negative error is the erroneous perception by a self-defender that he is not in imminent danger, resulting in a failure to defend himself and causing him serious or even deadly harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*586]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A self-defense rule that prefers false-negative to false-positive errors (such as the type of rule that operates in the courtroom) would give self-defenders very little latitude to make mistakes; self-defense would be justified only when the self-defender could be certain (say, beyond a reasonable doubt) that he needed to use deadly force to protect himself or his home. A rule that prefers false-positive over false-negative errors, however, would give a self-defender a great deal of latitude to make errors. Either way, self-defense law is significantly more tolerant of false-positive errors than are the courtrooms. The error tolerance the law countenances in this arena can be observed in two ways: through the reliance on the reasonable belief of the self-defender and through the burden of proof to establish the defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standard for evaluating decisions to use deadly force in self-defense is not whether the decision was correct, but merely whether it was reasonable. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n76</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Self-defense is composed of four elements: imminence, necessity, proportionality, and intention to thwart an attack. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n77</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Governing all of these parts, however, is the self-defender's reasonable belief in each. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n78</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The notion of reasonableness is in tension with the idea that for any given situation there is an underlying truth (that is identifiable). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n79</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reasonableness is at play in the general courtroom situation discussed above; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n80</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in that scenario, it cuts in favor of false negatives - the reasonable doubt standard protecting against erroneous convictions - but in the self-defense scenario, it cuts in favor of false positives - reasonableness gives a self-defender latitude to be wrong in his assessment of a situation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n81</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drawing on the Hattori example from earlier, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n82</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it was at least arguably reasonable for Mr. Peairs to believe his life and home were in danger and that deadly force was &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*587]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  necessary to protect them. Thus, even though we know, ex post, that Mr. Peairs was wrong in his assessment, the requirement of reasonableness allows his defensive actions to be justified based on his own perceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two tests for the reasonableness of a self-defender's use of deadly force: objective (what a reasonable person would believe) and subjective (what the particular self-defender believed). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n83</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The choice of whether to use an objective or subjective test has great consequence for considering error tolerance. The subjective test is distinctly more tolerant of error on the part of the self-defender than is the objective test. In fact, the choice of test can be seen as the result, rather than the source, of the error-tolerance level:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In self-defense law, the choice has often been framed in terms of mistake: If a defendant makes an honest mistake in believing that he is being unlawfully attacked, is he nevertheless entitled to use defensive force? If the answer is an unqualified &quot;yes,&quot; the law adopts a subjective test. If the answer is a qualified &quot;yes&quot; - specifically, if his honest mistake must be &quot;reasonable&quot; in order to provide a defense - then the law adopts an objective test. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n84</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> This question can be reframed through the lens of error tolerance: is the benefit of individuals being able to protect themselves greater than the cost of mistaken defenses? If the answer is yes, the test will be subjective. If it is no, or a qualified yes, the test will be objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the objective test is not wholly immune to false positives either. First, even the objective test has elements of subjectivity that allow room for mistakes. Even a &quot;reasonable man&quot; can make an incorrect assessment of danger, imminence, necessity, or proportionality - the four evaluations required for a successful self-defense argument. Thus, even the most strict standard (the objective reasonableness standard) leaves a good deal of room for false positives (and accordingly very little room for false negatives).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way to view the error tolerance in a self-defense context is through the burden placed on the self-defender who uses self-defense to defeat liability. Generally, self-defense is an affirmative defense to both civil and criminal charges, which means that the defendant must assert and prove he acted in self-defense in order for his actions to be legally justified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n85</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> self-defense. The Supreme &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*588]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court has not defined the minimum burden acceptable for a defendant to establish that she acted in self-defense, but it has set a ceiling: an instruction that &quot;self-defense evidence&quot; must &quot;satisfy the preponderance standard&quot; would be unconstitutional. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n86</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other words, the defendant need not prove by greater than fifty-percent that his actions met the self-defense requirement; an acceptable standard must be some amount less than that. The lower the burden on the defendant to prove self-defense, the more society can be understood to value self-defense as a justification and accept the errors that come with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the logic behind the self-defense rule is that there is a social benefit to allowing individuals to defend themselves against attack. As LaFave explains, it is &quot;only just&quot; for people to be able to use force to defend themselves against attack. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n87</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He writes, &quot;if A killed B to prevent B from killing him, then the defense of self-defense comes into play because the purposes of the criminal law are better served by A's acquittal.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n88</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Paul Robinson puts it slightly differently, describing the justification for defensive force in a way that sounds remarkably consistent with a false-positive-minimization regime: &quot;One may even permit the killing of three attacking thugs to save one innocent person, though the harm caused is clearly greater, because society highly values the protection of innocents and deplores unjustified aggression.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n89</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The breadth of self-defense rules, and their universality, make clear that the principles behind the right to self-defense are as deeply ingrained in the American psyche as are false-negative-preference regimes of reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence, creating a tension between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far, this Note has reviewed two different legal scenarios and the corresponding error preference. In the courtroom, false-negative errors are preferred, and in situations of self-defense, the law favors false-positive errors. These two legal situations are in direct tension, which can be understood in two ways. First, this tension is not necessarily problematic. Indeed, it can be viewed as a balance, each side of which is necessary to keep the other in check. Too great a preference for false negatives (in the courtroom) would leave crime victims insufficiently protected; too great a preference for false positives (in individual uses of self-defense) would leave perceived criminals insufficiently protected. When gun laws change to become more restrictive or, as we have more commonly seen recently, more permissive, this balance shifts. That shift should be the focus of analytical inquiry; instead of merely examining how crime rates change in response to changing gun laws, policy-makers should consider whether pushing towards a false-positive-prioritizing regime with the passage of more permissive gun laws is helpful or harmful to society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*589]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Second, though self-defense rules favor false positives, they still require an affirmative ex-post showing in a court of law that the use of self-defense by a defendant was justified. There the self-defense rules will be put in direct tension with the reasonable doubt and presumption of innocence rules. The fact that self-defense protections operate only ex post mitigates their false-positive-prioritization effects; a self-defender might fail to use a gun, reasonably and legally, for fear that the false-positive-prevention mechanisms of the court system that may later judge her will fail. The very nature of self-defense, with its requirement of imminent harm, means that it is impossible to make ex-ante adjudications of whether a self-defender's decision will grant her legal immunity under the self-defense doctrine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So while the American system, from a structural perspective, clearly contemplates defensive gun use, and its attendant false-positive preference, it often requires the decision to take a false-positive error risk (shooting in self-defense) to be justified ex post in court. The passage of permissive gun laws, including right-to-carry laws, would seem to imply an acceptance (or even an encouragement) of more frequent legally justified defensive gun use, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n90</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, accordingly, of false-positive-preference decisions. Although ex-post rationalizations may still be necessary, potentially minimizing the magnitude of this shift, the shift remains nonetheless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. Locating Gun Laws in Error-Preference Models<BR>&nbsp;<BR> With the general error-tolerance landscape of the law laid out, I now turn to considering how private ownership of guns fits into this picture and affects the balance of error risk. This Part will first examine the state of gun laws in America, revealing a wide and growing acceptance of the use of guns in self-defense, which indicates a growing tolerance for false positives. This Part then examines the implications of that shift, and how one might contextualize social responses, by addressing the social implications of expanding the use of self-defense. Finally, it considers the expected societal response to this shift and whether there is a moral imperative to use either a false-positive-or false-negative-minimizing system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*590]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Changing Gun Laws<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Americans are allowed to keep their guns - or prohibited from doing so - mostly according to a variety of state (rather than federal) restrictions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n91</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are four broad categories of state gun control laws: bans on certain firearms; sales and purchase restrictions; sentence enhancement laws; and possession restrictions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n92</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For consideration of defensive gun uses, it is the last category that is most relevant, because possession restrictions bear directly upon the ability of citizens to carry weapons for self-defense under the law. Possession restrictions are what expand the circumstances and opportunities for the exercise of the false-positive-preferring self-defense doctrine discussed above. This choice can be understood to be at the expense of the use of the false-negative-preferring criminal justice system, because a potential criminal who is shot and killed by a self-defender is not going to be arrested, tried, and have his guilt adjudicated in a court of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only two states - Vermont and Alaska - do not require an individual to have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n93</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every other state has laws that are referred to variously as &quot;concealed-carry&quot; and &quot;right-to-carry&quot; (RTC) laws. Thirty-six states can be characterized as &quot;shall-issue&quot; concealed-carry states, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n94</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because their law maintains that most individuals, with a few objective limits, shall be issued a concealed-carry permit upon application. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n95</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are also &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*591]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;may-issue&quot; states, in which permit applicants must demonstrate good cause for their permit before it is approved. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n96</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eleven states have these discretionary permits of varying degrees of restrictiveness. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n97</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, two states make it impossible or nearly impossible to receive concealed-carry permits. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n98</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These numbers are significant on their own; more than two-thirds of American states will issue concealed-carry permits to almost anyone who wants them. The numbers become more significant as part of a trend, however. Concealed-carry laws began in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s; before that, states either banned concealed weapons entirely or permitted them freely. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n99</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new laws states enacted were based largely on a model law that prohibited unlicensed concealed carrying. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n100</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By 2003, twenty-one states had passed more restrictive concealed-carry laws, either discretionary permitting or flat-out prohibitions on concealed carrying. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n101</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 2003, however, this trend has reversed: eight states have either enacted RTC laws or adjusted their may-issue laws to become shall issue. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n102</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*592]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If more people are being allowed to carry concealed weapons, then more people have the opportunity to shoot in self-defense. Though any individual shooting is not more or less likely to be erroneous, the greater frequency of defensive shootings that RTC laws allows means that there will be a greater total number of errors (even if the rate of error remains the same). Thus, the movement in favor of RTC laws, at least in theory, creates more opportunities for false-negative-minimizing defensive shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally important, though less prevalent than RTC laws, is an expansion of the Castle Doctrine. Historically, the Castle Doctrine suspends the duty to retreat and permits the use of deadly force to protect one's home. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n103</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the new NRA-backed Castle Doctrine legislation expands this exception to include places other than one's home; indeed, to any place one is legally entitled to be. The NRA describes its the legislation as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castle Doctrine, in essence, simply places into law what is a fundamental right: self-defense. If a person is in a place he or she has a right to be - in the front yard, on the road, working in their office, strolling in the park - and is confronted by an armed predator, he or she can respond in force in defense of their lives. Castle Doctrine also protects the law-abiding from criminal and civil charges for defending themselves against an attacker whereby, after enduring the trauma of a violent attack, they aren't again tied to the tracks of a drawn-out, nightmarish legal battle that could derail their financial future. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n104</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> In April 2005, Florida became the first state to enact this new Castle Doctrine into law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n105</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the following year and a half, eight other states - Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, and South Dakota - followed suit. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n106</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On September 1, 2007, a particularly strong law, extending Castle-Doctrine protection to vehicles and workplaces, went into effect in Texas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n107</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Castle Doctrine is a particularly important barometer for measuring error tolerance, because, by permitting (or even encouraging) increased defensive gun use, it strongly favors the false-positive side of the error-risk balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As noted in Part II, in courtroom adjudications of guilt or innocence, the law favors false negatives, but in the self-defense context the preference is for false positives. By generating more and more circumstances in which individuals &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*593]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are allowed to, in a moment, adjudicate guilt and innocence, the increasing number of shall-issue RTC laws and particularly the emergence of the expanded Castle Doctrine shifts the burden of law enforcement from the government to the individual, deputizing private citizens. In so doing, these legislative changes add significant weight to the false-positive-preferring side of the error-risk balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Implications of Changing Gun Laws<BR>&nbsp;<BR> In addition to broadening the category of shootings that are considered legal, more permissive gun laws have a number of other implications, both practical and theoretical. The shift in the laws may create a negative feedback cycle of confidence in the police. It also may lead to an increase in vigilante justice. Finally, it may signal a moral conclusion about the relative value of different error risks when human life is on the line. Each of these possible consequences is discussed in turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the shift toward legalizing defensive gun use may create a self-reinforcing effect of weakening confidence in the power of government as a law enforcement agency: we do not have confidence in the police, so we need to protect ourselves; because we are protecting ourselves, the role of the police (and therefore our confidence in them) diminishes. The cycle self-perpetuates. The notion that personal possession of firearms may shift attitudes about law enforcement is not novel. In 1932, one homicide scholar stated that &quot;the possession of firearms gives a false sense of security and encourages recklessness and arrogance.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n108</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sense of security lulls people into thinking formal law enforcement is unnecessary, while the attendant recklessness underscores the need for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of confidence in the ability of the police to stop crimes is often used as a justification for RTC laws and the use of guns in self-defense. This is rarely framed as abject mistrust of the police; instead, it is argued that the lack of confidence stems from the pragmatic notion that even the best equipped and most well-intentioned police cannot stop crimes in progress. Gary Kleck argues, for instance, that the idea &quot;that citizens can depend on police for effective protection&quot; is &quot;simply untrue.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n109</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He elaborates:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It implies that police can serve the same function as a gun in disrupting a crime in progress, before the victim is hurt or loses property. Police cannot do this, and indeed do not themselves even claim to be able to do so. Instead, police primarily respond reactively to crimes after they have occurred, questioning the victim and other witnesses in the hope that they can apprehend the criminals, make them available for prosecution &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*594]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and punishment, and thereby deter other criminals from attempting crimes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n110</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> The argument that people should be allowed to carry guns because of the inability of police to stop crimes in progress was raised immediately and vociferously after the tragic shootings at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University on April 16, 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a disturbed student at Virginia Tech went on a violent rampage, killing thirty-two people before turning the gun on himself, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n111</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advocates of gun rights immediately cited the massacre as evidence that individuals should more readily be allowed to carry guns to defend themselves. Ted Nugent, a member of the National Rifle Association's board of directors, made an impassioned plea for restrictive gun laws to be abandoned in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embrace the facts, demand upgrade and be certain that your children's school has a better plan than Virginia Tech or Columbine. Eliminate the insanity of gun-free zones, which will never, ever be gun-free zones. They will only be good guy gun-free zones, and that is a recipe for disaster written in blood on the altar of denial. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n112</SUP></SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> At least one legislative initiative picked up on Nugent's plea: Texas Governor Rick Perry proposed, in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, that all licensed gun owners be allowed to carry weapons on their persons (in other words, carry concealed weapons) rather than just keeping them in their homes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n113</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The argument is that even if the police cannot get there in time, &quot;brave, average, armed citizens [can] neutralize&quot; a lunatic gunman and thus save innocent lives. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n114</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Situations like Virginia Tech provide compelling examples in which it is hard to imagine a defensive shooting being in error. But most situations in which individuals experience themselves to be under threat are not as cut and dry as Virginia Tech; consider again the example of the Japanese exchange student at the beginning of this Note. All defensive shootings bear some measure of risk that a person will be shot erroneously; the question that is important from a policy perspective is whether society believes lay citizens &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*595]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or law-enforcement agents are in a better position to make this decision. One rationalization for RTC laws might be that allowing more defensive shootings by citizens (and therefore proportionally fewer by police) will result in fewer overall errors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, some gun rights advocates cite police incompetence as a reason for the passage of RTC laws in a way that echoes this Note's error-risk framework without invoking it explicitly. For example, in his argument for why individuals should be armed, Lott notes that &quot;police accidentally kill as many as 330 innocent individuals annually.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n115</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police errors are important in the risk calculus - indeed, decisions by police officers to shoot (or not to shoot) suspects are subject to similar high false-positive-error risk as civilian defensive shooting decisions. High-profile cases of erroneous (but not criminal) police shootings regularly make headlines; take, for example, the case of Amadou Diallo in New York. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n116</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These errors make less compelling the notion that RTC laws, and citizen defensive shootings, cause an overall net increase in the number of erroneous shootings. Still, police shootings are different from civilian shootings in many important ways: space does not permit a thorough discussion of the distinction, but, at a minimum, it is significant to note that police make their decisions within the regulated, monitored confines of the criminal justice system, and are subject to extensive training, supervision, and detailed rules about the use of weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sense that police are inadequate to protect American citizens is also important in the discussion of self-defense because it further blurs the already fuzzy line between self-defense and vigilantism. Generally, defensive gun use can be &quot;distinguished from other forms of forceful activity directed at criminals, such as vigilantism, or activities of the criminal justice system ... such as police making arrests&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n117</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or police shootings. Although all &quot;can be coercive&quot; and &quot;may be done by armed persons,&quot; there is a significant characteristic of vigilantism in the criminal justice system that is (theoretically) absent from self-defense: the pursuit of ex-post justice rather than ex-ante prevention. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n118</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, there are, as Kleck notes, &quot;some parallels.&quot; Historically, &quot;vigilantism, in the true sense of collective private force used for social control purposes, flourished where legal controls were weakest, such as frontier areas.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n119</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, where the police force is viewed as inadequate for &quot;social control purposes,&quot; self-defense fills in the gap. Indeed, Kleck acknowledges, &quot;the late twentieth century substitute &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*596]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  for vigilantism is individualistic resistance to criminals by those directly victimized.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n120</SUP></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result may be that situations previously characterized as vigilantism will now, under more permissive RTC laws and particularly where the standard for self-defense is subjective, be considered legitimate self-defense. This bears on the error-risk calculus in two ways. First, it increases in raw numbers the opportunities for citizen shootings and the attendant false-positive-error preferences. Second, the increased room for permissible vigilante activity suggests a systematic shift in whom we as a society trust to keep us safe - fellow citizens or the government. When we pick the latter, we tend to impose the false-positive-minimizing rules; more opportunities for defense that borders on vigilantism puts weight on the false-negative-minimizing side of the scale. This vigilante effect can be viewed as the other side of the closely-related concept of decreasing confidence in law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though this Note intends to be non-normative in its analysis, it would be remiss not to consider the moral implications of shifting to a system that increasingly tolerates false positives through increasingly permissive gun laws. It is hard to avoid the moral undertones of the n guilty men analysis discussed above; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n121</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the suggestion for any n ratio is that taking the life of an innocent person is morally unacceptable (by varying degrees). Accordingly, it might be morally indefensible to shift away from a false-positive-minimization system by passing more permissive gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, a strong argument can be made that permissive gun laws (and other false-positive tolerating systems) are not only morally acceptable but actually morally required if the false positives that result (erroneous defensive shootings) cause an overall reduction in the taking of innocent lives. Professors Cass R. Sunstein and Adrian Vermeule recently made this argument in the context of capital punishment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n122</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They argue that if capital punishment can be statistically shown to deter future crime, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n123</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it is the moral responsibility of society to use it. Their moral argument can easily be applied to the gun control debate specifically with respect to deterrence, but it also bears weight as a broader response to false-positive minimization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand, Sunstein and Vermeule's argument can be seen as a refutation of a false-positive-minimization philosophy. If any particular mechanism of justice, be it capital punishment or the increased opportunity for legally justified defensive shootings, trades the deprivation of one individual for the preservation &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*597]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of more than one other, it should be morally required, false positives notwithstanding. To the extent that self-defense laws have a deterrent effect, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n124</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they seem eminently consistent with the Sunstein and Vermeule moral obligation theory discussed above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the moral obligation theory can thus be seen as supporting the false-negative-minimizing self-defense system, it can also be seen to be consistent with a false-positive-minimization system. Sunstein and Vermeule's argument can be characterized as suggesting that society look not at the risk of a false positive in each individual case but rather at the risk of error in society as a statistical whole. If each defensive shooting saves numerous other innocent lives (which would be taken in error through crime), then a true false-positive-minimization system might prefer erroneous deprivation of a single individual (by shooting someone who is not committing a crime and thus depriving him of his life or health) to limit the number of false positives made on the whole. Either way, the Sunstein and Vermeule argument provides a strong counterweight to any suggestion that it is morally necessary to minimize false positives by relying on the criminal justice system to keep us safe rather than permitting self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Note has attempted to put a new theoretical twist on a topic of fervent academic and political debate: the implication of any connection between gun laws and crime rates. Rather than merely looking at the correlative relationship between gun laws and crime, I suggest the implications that permissive gun laws have on error risk must be considered. This argument is not empirical but rather theoretical (and perhaps moral). While empirical analysis of this subject might be possible, it would be extremely difficult. More importantly, empirics are not necessary to prove the point I make: the justice system can be framed as a balance of error risk that is based on a social evaluation of the &quot;comparative social disutility&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n125</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of false positives and false negatives in different contexts. Social disutility is measured not by the rate of the errors but rather by the cost of each error to society. Though the assessment of cost might be measured empirically, decisions about cost tend to be made by courts on the basis of moral value judgments. My argument here is that the value judgment about the cost of an erroneous defensive shooting must become a part of the conversation about RTC and other gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it were possible to make an empirical assessment of cost, in the end, the debate may be exactly the deontological type that Sunstein and Vermeule describe with respect to capital punishment. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n126</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here the question would be whether the moral arguments underpinning self-defense rules (the moral propriety &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*598]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of protecting oneself and others and the general deterrent effect) trump any statistical proof that more or greater harm results from permitting individuals to engage in that defense. Sunstein and Vermeule suggest that whichever regime results in fewest number of deaths is &quot;morally obligatory.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n127</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the very least, the question is one of democratic policy preference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is significant because discussions of gun policy are not merely academic, and currently the policy overemphasizes crime rates as the only significant standard of analysis. As &quot;policymakers, voters, and the courts ... decide the appropriate trade-off between safety, on the one hand, and public expenditure and imposition, on the other,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n128</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> they rely on &quot;fundamental assumptions&quot; about &quot;whether reducing the number of guns in private hands would lead to more or less violent crime.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n129</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, they should also be considering the consequences of the error-risk shift, so that the cost-benefit trade-offs and the moral implications they create become conscious policy decisions rather than collateral effects. Specifically, policy-makers should consider the impact of increasingly permissive gun laws on the risk of erroneous defensive shootings and how that risk plays into not only the moral equation but also public confidence in the justice system and in law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussions over gun policy are likely to get even more heated as the Supreme Court considers the scope of the Second Amendment for the first time in sixty-eight years. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n130</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Court will consider the appeal of District of Columbia v. Heller, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n131</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in which the D.C. Circuit relied in part on the Second Amendment's premise that guns would be kept by citizens for &quot;self-defense, ... understood as resistance to either private lawlessness or the depredations of a tyrannical government (or a threat from abroad).&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n132</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though Heller does not speak explicitly to the guns and crime debate, it does nod to the significance of the self-defense doctrine, and it takes seriously the notion that there is a connection between the possession of a gun for self-defense and the prevention of crime. Furthermore, as the case is adjudicated in the Supreme Court, it is likely to reinvigorate debate &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">[*599]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on both sides of the gun control aisle over the propriety of expansive or restrictive doctrines. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n133</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Error-risk analysis must be a part of those debates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c28"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The error-risk approach to criminal justice policy has implications above and beyond gun laws; indeed, it could be applied to any other policy regime that might disrupt the current tension. For example, using error risk as a lens to examine the death penalty, one must ask whether a shift towards a prohibition on the use of capital punishment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n134</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will put a finger on the scale in favor of false-positive minimization. Relaxation of restrictions on wiretapping </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c29"><SUP>n135</SUP></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might cut the other way, as the innocent are more frequently caught-up or convicted. Though the issue of legal defensive gun use (and the laws that permit it) fits most crisply into an error-risk framework, this analytical tool can provide a valuable new angle through which to examine other policy projects.</SPAN></P>

Kahan and Braman argue - and Cook and Ludwig refute their claim - that whether or not one supports gun control is largely a result of whether one believes in the risk of &quot;insufficient regulation [of guns that] will make citizens vulnerable to deliberate or accidental shootings,&quot; or &quot;excessive regulation [of guns that] will leave citizens unable to defend themselves against violent predation.&quot; Kahan &amp; Braman, More Statistics, Less Persuasion, supra, at 1299.

L. 48, tit. 19, 1.5). John Fortescue expressed the sentiment even more dramatically: &quot;Indeed, one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death than that one innocent person should be condemned and suffer capitally.&quot; John Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum Angliae 94 (Frederick Gregor trans., 1984) (1874).

Furthermore, because of the polarizing nature of the trial and verdict, one can imagine that public reaction would have been similarly intense had the jury gone the other way. Paradoxically, it is hard to find an example at such public outcry against a purportedly erroneous conviction precisely because the system is structured to minimize such episodes. (Of course, examples of allegedly or actually erroneous convictions abound - one notable example is the Scottsboro Boys in the 1930s. See Dan T.

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c30"><SPAN CLASS="c31">n91.&nbsp; Federal law does have a major role to play in gun rights. Two major federal laws - the ban on felons carrying guns, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 922(g)(1) (2000), and the ban on juvenile gun possession, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 922(x) (2000) - affect millions of Americans. In addition, federal law prohibits gun possession by those under felony indictment, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 922(n) (2000); anyone convicted in any court of even misdemeanor domestic violence, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 922(g)(9) (2000); drug addicts, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 922(g)(3) (2000); and other categories of people. In addition, federal law regulates various aspects of the sale and transfer of firearms. See Nat'l Rifle Ass'n, A Citizen's Guide to Federal Firearms Laws, http://www.nraila.org/GunLaws/Federal/Read.aspx?id=60 (last visited Mar. 5, 2008). Until recently, federal law also banned Assault Weapons, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 922(v), (w) (2000), but that prohibition lapsed in 2004. Nonetheless, for the category of those legally eligible to possess firearms under federal law, states are the source of the vast majority of regulations concerning how and where those guns may be carried. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I WANT you to tell me how I can trust the justice system. Mister Attorney General, the question is for you. And you too, Ms. Police Officer, Madame District Attorney, and Mr. Judge. It is also for you, Mr. and Ms. Average Citizen. I realize this will be an engraved invitation for those crackpots who get their jollies flouting their hatefulness and ignorance on electronic message boards and I'm willing to live with that because the question, I assure you, is in earnest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody tell me: How can I trust the justice system? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will think this is about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the unarmed black man who died in a fusillade of 50 bullets from New York police on what was to have been his wedding day; the shooters were acquitted last week. But the question isn't about Bell, at least not solely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, it's about the fact that the justice system so often seems to have less justice in it where black people are concerned. It's about Amadou Diallo, shot at 41 times - hit 19 - by New York police while reaching for his wallet. It's about Rodney King, beaten to pieces by L.A. police for a traffic violation. It's about Arthur McDuffie, beaten to &quot;death&quot; by Miami police for a traffic violation. It's about Jeffrey Gilbert, bones fractured by police who broke into the Greenbelt, Md., apartment of his girlfriend and pounced on him as he lay nude in bed because they mistakenly thought him a cop killer. It's about L.A. police manufacturing and planting evidence. It's about my son, stopped by police for driving with an &quot;obstructed&quot; windshield - he had an air freshener in the shape of a Christmas tree dangling from his rear-view mirror. It's about studies documenting the enduring racial bias in our justice system so that, for example, blacks account for 13 percent of all regular drug users, but 35 percent of those arrested, 55 percent of those convicted, and 74 percent of those imprisoned, for drug possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's about knowing the foregoing will be greeted with blithe indifference by those who find it convenient to believe the unjust treatment of blacks is somehow excusable, understandable, merited or required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I need no lectures to remind me that good people inhabit the system; my cousin is a federal prosecutor. Nor do I need any lectures on the heroism of cops; I've ridden with police, been protected by them, and yield to no one in my admiration for those who do that job with honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So save the lectures, just give me an answer: How can I trust a system whose biases against people who look like me are simultaneously well-documented, yet happily ignored by those who resemble me not at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question matters because without trust, the system doesn't work. Everybody came down, and justifiably so, on the idiot rapper who said last year that he would not call police even if a serial killer were living next door. Unfortunately, fewer people bothered to ask where such profound distrust comes from. Fewer still bothered to ask what it leads to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People don't participate in systems they don't trust. They don't come forward, they don't testify. So criminals go uncaptured and crimes, unpunished. Yet some black people apparently find that preferable to participating in a system they believe is rigged against them. I don't agree with them, but before you condemn them, ask yourself: Would you play in a game refereed by someone who hated you? What's the point?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In games as in life, you may not like an outcome, but if you believe it was fairly derived, you can at least live with it. Small wonder black people often find it difficult to live with this system. Last week's acquittal will do nothing to change that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I'm serious. Somebody tell me how I can trust American justice. Somebody tell me why I should even try.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;street organizing&quot; coalition that briefly blocked rush hour traffic in front of Madison Square Garden yesterday evening to protest the acquittal of three detectives in the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the demonstration was the beginning of disruptions planned for the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the groups said that besides being &quot;very loud and chaotic,&quot; they wanted to urge the comedian Chris Rock, who was performing at the arena, and other black celebrities to join in the protests against the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a civil disobedience. We're not getting permits, we're going places we're not supposed to be,&quot; one of the organizers, Salaam Ismial, said. &quot;We're looking for the endorsement of Chris Rock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the groups are a coalition of grassroots community organizations that include Communities United Against Police Brutality and Mr. Ismial's own organization, the United Youth Council, which joined together this week after a judge acquitted the police detectives who fatally shot Bell in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouting &quot;no justice, no peace&quot; and counting down the number of bullets fired at Bell - 50 - the protesters blocked an M4 bus and a sea of yellow taxis traveling on Seventh Avenue for about 10 minutes. Although police were present, no one was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reverend Al Sharpton has been promising to shut down the city with protests, but he and the Bell family were not present yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's family and friends have held several news conferences in recent days to denounce the verdict and also have promised major actions. They have enlisted the help of federal lawmakers, including nearly a dozen members of Congress, to examine how the federal government might get involved in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier yesterday, the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, said he did not expect any violence. Representatives for Mr. Rock and for Madison Square Garden did not immediately return messages seeking comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after officers convinced the student to drop his weapon did they discover that it merely looked like a lethal .44-caliber revolver. It was, in fact, a loaded pellet gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirk Hanley, 22, of Brooklyn, had several suicide notes and a journal on him when he was taken into custody, police said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And law-enforcement sources told The Post that the crazed student mentioned being killed by cops like Bell, both during the terrifying standoff and in his journal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to die like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; a source quoted Hanley as saying.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanley began following a 20-year-old female student, who knows him, at 135th Street and Convent Avenue as she walked to CCNY's Harlem campus at around 2:40 p.m.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he allegedly showed the young woman his gun, she fled to the school's Financial Aid office and reported it to a counselor in a private room. Campus security and cops were immediately alerted, said school President Gregory H. Williams.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanley followed, but stayed in the waiting room, which was full of about a dozen people.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As campus security approached Hanley, he took the replica revolver from his backpack and grabbed a woman who was standing next to him, Williams said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, NYPD Officers Daniel Laperuta and Steve Jagaroo entered the room, drew their guns on Hanley, cops said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deranged student yelled, &quot;Back off!&quot; at the cops as he threatened his hostage - then pointed the gun at himself, police sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the cops tried to calm him, Hanley allegedly aimed the weapon once more at the frightened young woman, then finally put it down and was subdued by the officers about five minutes after the drama began.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was taken to St. Luke's Hospital for a psych exam and was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a loaded firearm and kidnapping.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reached on her cellphone, the woman Hanley had followed said only that she was &quot;fine.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her mom said her daughter was in a class last year with Hanley.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Hanley's MySpace page, he has pictures of himself attacking the camera with a butcher knife.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lists his &quot;heroes&quot; as Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, &quot;Cho&quot; - a reference to Virginia Tech killer Seung-Hui Cho - and &quot;Reb and V,&quot; the nicknames of Columbine gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Hanley's apartment in Brooklyn, one neighbor described him as a quiet loner but added that he &quot;always seemed very peaceful, very calm.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the detectives union accused the Rev. Al Sharpton and his lawyer pal yesterday of &quot;misleading people&quot; on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem I think with this case - it would go back to Sharpton and [attorney Sanford] Rubenstein - is they spent so much time misleading people, and this is a very dangerous thing,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They misled the public right from the start, if you recall, and that's why the [district attorney] got so heavily involved,&quot; Palladino said during a meeting with the New York Post editorial board.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Sharpton misled the Bell family, along with the other shooting victims, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, on the detectives' supposed guilt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, the three cops who fired the collective 50 shots that killed Bell outside a strip club on his wedding day in November 2006 were acquitted of all charges.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino said that the victims' $50 million lawsuit against the officers and the NYPD didn't help the prosecution, noting that during cross-examination, Benefield said he wouldn't say anything to hurt the case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sharpton's greed and Rubenstein's greed mislead the public,&quot; Palladino said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton responded, &quot;I never promised anything but the pursuit of justice.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that he has no financial stake in the civil suit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I challenge [Palladino to name] any lawsuit that I or [the National Action Network] would benefit from,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a relaxed-looking Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 shots, reported for modified desk duty early in the morning at the 13th Precinct station house on East 21st Street in Manhattan. Oliver greeted a Post photographer with a wave. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor of New York said he was &quot;surprised&quot; by the acquittal of three police officers who shot dead an unarmed black man on his wedding day in a hail of bullets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Paterson's comments came after a top civil rights leader pledged to &quot;close&quot; New York City with protests over the verdicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed when undercover officers fired 50 shots at him and his friends as he left his stag party at the Club Kahlua strip bar in New York on November 25, 2006, hours before he was to wed his high school sweetheart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the officers, who had the club under surveillance for prostitution and drugs, were charged with offences from manslaughter to reckless endangerment for firing 46 of the 50 shots, but were cleared by Justice Arthur Cooperman at the Queens State Supreme Court on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence told the judge, who heard the case without a jury at the defendants' request, an officer confronted Mr Bell and his friends after hearing one of the group say: &quot;Go get my gat,&quot; slang for gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers - Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper - said they began firing when Mr Bell's Nissan Altima car tried to run over the detective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night Mr Paterson said the verdicts surprised him because of the number of shots fired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOUR APRIL 28 editorial on Mary Hayashi (&quot;Hayashi warrants support in Assembly District 18&quot;) reminded my of my letter in the Review a few weeks ago musing on how nice it would be to have a local politician bring pork to Hayward. Instead, Mrs. Hayashi used more than $100,000 in public money for pork for herself and her husband to pay for travel expenses and his campaign debts. Maybe it would be better to give the &quot;earnest,&quot; as you called him, Jason Teramoto a chance to handle public trust. l'm sure he wouldn't try to hide public officials' salaries from the paying public either, as Hayashi had. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also saw, on the local news, Councilman Olden Henson smiling, calm and assuring Hayward residents not to worry about the mountain lion sightings   from his backyard porch in the Hayward hills. That's the real problem I see. All the council members and the mayor live in the hills. None represent the majority of Hayward. I would love to see Francisco Zermeno be elected. He lives with us, teaches, runs a Hayward business and belongs to the Hayward Chamber of Commerce. I have never read that he attended some developer's party for building on our greenbelt, as some local officials have done. In a city half Latino, it is beyond wrong   it is immoral that not one council member is Hispanic. That, to me, is something to worry about, not mountain lions overrunning Mission and Tennyson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poison of society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT CAME AS no surprise to many of us in the black community that the three police officers who shot and killed the unarmed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in New York were acquitted. That an unarmed person can be slain in a hail of 46 bullets and no one is held responsible is symptomatic of a society that places lesser value on the lives of people of color. Racism is like a poison that is soaked into the very fabric of this nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in the irony of all ironies, you have presidential candidate Barack Obama having to run around the country trying to convince white people that he is not a racist or a closet militant. How pathetic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">San Leandro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skewed priorities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER NEARLY EIGHT years of Bush/Cheney manipulation, the war profiteers and petroleum conglomerates are making record profits while infrastructure, schools and hospitals are suffering a precipitous decline. It is obvious that Republican goals do not benefit the average citizen, but rather the needs of the wealthy. Why, then, do middle-class voters continue to support the Republican Party? Perhaps they still believe the rhetoric that they will be lifted by that &quot;rising tide,&quot; however, the reality is obvious: are you better off with $4-per-gallon gasoline and food prices doubling? Have your investments made you wealthy, or have you simply lost the money you invested in mutual funds? It's time to evaluate what has actually happened and disregard the political nonsense spewed by right-wing talk-show hosts, Republican Party spokespeople and so-called &quot;think tanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the United States is to continue as a world leader in the 21st century, we need to forget business as usual and define a path forward not dictated by petroleum interests and wealthy political manipulators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued support of the Republican approach to government simply continues the decline in our infrastructure, and mortgages the future to generate increasing profits for the ultra-wealthy. Those are not true American values.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOWNPATRICK are being forced to field a tender generation of players - and are suffering the consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young, enthusiastic, snappy and full of bite they may be, but the severe lack of physical power and experience is taking its toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their time will come but the club's minor players were no match for an ordinary Shamrocks team that made the most of their more physical strength, destroying the match as a contest six minutes into the second half when Eoin Magennis rifled in his side's second goal to open up a nine points lead, 2-09 to 1-03. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This crunching defeat at Pairc Tomas Ruiseil came on the heels of an opening day knock-out by Ballymartin, their staggering start already plunging the RGU into dog-fight territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Peter Telford, Michael McGarrity, Kevin Gracey, Richard Starkey, Peter Robinson, Tony McShane, to name but a few, the final scoreline all too harshly relating the story of a one-sided contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no real support for big Peter Turley who strove majestically to spur his younger team-mates on and who might have snatched a couple of goals in the second half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His younger brother, Damian, is now a full fledged senior player and well worth his place in the side, fired in a goal in the fourth minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl Oakes and Barry Gracey attempted to add some experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a free flowing Shamrocks were never seriously threatened and as the contest unfolded they continued to rack up the scores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't take them long to register their intentions, opening up a three points lead in the opening three minutes, a Kevin McGuigan free, and a point apiece from Neil Courtney and Marty Rafferty sounding out the warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Turley hammered to the net in Downpatrick's first attack to level the score at 1-00 to 0-03, but that was as good as it got for the Hoops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noel Henney fed Paul Rafferty with a lovely pass and he cracked a left footed beauty to the net to fire his side back in front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further points from Rafferty, following a brilliant scything move, Paul Rafferty and Henney saw Shamrocks soar ahead 1-07 to 1-00 by the 20th minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gareth Trainor grabbed a home point before young James Deeny stood up to Paul Rafferty's fierce shot to make a magnificent save in the 23rd minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An exchange of points between McGuigan and Karl Oakes set the half-time score at 1-08 to 1-02 in favour of Shamrocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young Jarleth Brannigan will undoubtedly become a very good gaelic footballer at senior level in the not too distant future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continually active, packed with enthusiasm and a mischievous raider, he added a new dimension to the stuttering Downpatrick front play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He still looks fragile at this level though but all credit to him for scoring three well-taken points in the second half after entering the match at the interval but with Shamrocks in total control was never any danger to the south down side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eoin Magennis dealt the hammer blow with his snap goal and from then on it was only a matter of how many more scores Shamrocks could pencil in before the final whistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Rafferty slammed in their third goal and further points from Magennis, Courtney and Marty Rafferty wrapped up a fine victory for Shamrocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RGU: James Deeny, Davy McCauley, Joe Starkey, Michael Breen, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barry Gracey, Liam Kearney, Peter Turley, Damian Turley, Garett Trainor, Caolan Boyd, Gerdie Collins, John Smyth, Karl Oaks, Neil Cunningham, (Subs) Vinnie McDevitt, Peter McKenna, Jarleth Brannigan, Danny Carville.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballymartin 1-12 Downpatrick 2-06</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOWNPATRICK suffered defeat in their first league match of the new season at the hands of impressive Ballymartin, writes Ciaran Daly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Division Two Clash was fiercely contested throughout but Ballymartin made home advantage pay and deservedly regis-tered their first two points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downpatrick, struggling with injuries, fielded a largely youthful and experimental side with five minors stepping into the starting line-up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballymartin, in contrast, played with the consistency of an experienced team and were able to make their mark on the game from the early stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cathal McDowell scored the first of his seven points to open up the scoring for Ballymartin on the five minutes mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downpatrick responded almost immediately when quick thinking from Damian Turley released Neil Cunningham who duly pointed to bring the sides level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crucially Downpatrick did not score again until the 24th minute. Most of their scoreless spell was spent camped in their own half as Ballymartin began to dominate possession in midfield and the half forward line in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mourne men pointed a free before stretching their lead in the 14th minute with an excellently taken goal by corner forward Conor Rodgers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high ball was lofted into the box. When it was broken down Rodgers was quickest to react and he kept his composure to find the back of the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballymartin built on what was now a four points advantage by scoring a further four points without reply, three of which came from the boot of the on-form McDowell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth the Downpatrick defence was having trouble dealing with the fluency and movement of the Ballymartin forwards. When the Hoops were able to work the ball forward the home defence stood firm and prevented Downpatrick from putting scores on the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballymartin dominance continued when centre half forward Ronan McManus burst through the visiting defence before wisely opting to fist a point that extended their lead to 1-6 to 0-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an eight points advantage there was a sense that Ballymartin were beginning to run away with it. Neil Cunningham, however, restored a sense of belief within The Hoops by converting a free to reduce the margin to seven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A scuffle on the sideline resulted in a player from each team getting a warning from the referee. This altercation seemed to have the effect of kick-starting Downpatrick into life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Smith notably became more involved in play and Downpatrick suddenly looked more threatening going forward as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mazy run down the right wing from Jarleth Brannigan created room for Damian Turley who was able to lob a pass into the path of Cunningham, who fisted to the net with conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal lifted the visitors and took them to within four points of their opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first half, which had been dominated by Ballymartin, ended on a positive note for Downpatrick with the scores sitting at 1-6 to 1-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downpatrick looked to build on their momentum at the start of the second half with substitutes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Carl Oakes being introduced to the fray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However there was little that could be done to stop the opening score of the second half going to Michael Higgins who finished what had been a superb passage of play from Ballymartin with a fine point to extend the Lilywhites' lead to five points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McDowell added to Downpatrick's woes by converting another free ten minutes into the half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As was the pattern for the entire match Downpatrick refused to surrender and some spirited play from the Hoops saw substitute Peter McKenna grab a welcome point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endeavour and attitude Downpatrick will doubtlessly have been seen as a positive aspect of their play and one which management will be keen to draw from in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outplayed for large parts of the game the away team seemed dogged in their determination not to be beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darren O'Hanlon pounced on some slack defending by scoring a point directly from a goal-kick. Downpatrick though fired back with two points in quick succession, from Carl Oakes and Peter Turley, to reduce the deficit to 1-9 to 1-5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost on cue, just as the Hoops were beginning to build some momentum, McDowell pointed another free on 18 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This seemed to compose Ballymartin with O'Hanlon and Fitzmorris in particular pulling the strings in midfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young Downpatrick goalkeeper James Deeny pulled off his second fantastic save of the night to ensure his team did not go another goal down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was little he could do though to prevent Damian Magennis from opening up a six points lead with five minutes remaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With time running out Downpatrick pushed Peter Turley further forward and targeted the big midfielder with some direct balls into the danger area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tactic paid dividends as two minutes from time Turley was able to field the ball close to goal and blast home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the score at 2-05 to 1-11 and a few minutes of injury time left to play Downpatrick began to believe they could conjure up an escape act Houdini would have been proud of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the final minute of play Ballymartin's Magennis got the insurance point the home side needed to put the result of the match beyond doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballymartin will be upbeat about their prospects of getting out of Division 2 this year after a solid display against a spirited Downpatrick side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downpatrick themselves can take a lot away from the match despite their loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collection of young players brought into the team looked comfortable playing at senior level and their perseverance will be a major bonus to them throughout the remaining matches in their league campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ballymartin: Gavin, S Brannigan, Cunningham, P Fitzpatrick, M Higgins (0-1), J Fitzpatrick, Doran, Fit Morris, O'Hanlon (0-1), Magennis (0-2), McManus (0-1), McDowell (0-7), Rodgers (1-0), Rooney, J Fitzpatrick (Subs) L Byrne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downpatrick: J Deeny, Breen, Carville, Kearney, G Collins, McCauley, R Starkey, P Turley (1-1), Gracey, Trainor, D Turley, N Cunningham (1-2), J Brannigan, Boyd, Smith (Subs) S Bell, C Oakes (0-1), P McKenna (0-1)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, the Man U boss should know. He's had more squeaky bums than any other manager in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look what's happening to the shaky reds at the moment. They felt the blues at the weekend and will have to do something special to remain in the Champions Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the most durable club boss in the world really means is that - Stevie and Karl, it's there waiting for you. It's all about handling pressure over the next few games. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't underestimate the teams that stand in your way. Don't fear them either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time now for shrewd judges and cool heads. It's time now for one final push. It's time now to be hailed champions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sweat is on. Expectancy sweeps through the town. Can the boys deliver?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A momentous week has thrust Downpatrick to within four points of the Amateur League's most sought after prize - the League crown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derby hits over two of their fiercest rivals, Kilmore Rec and Killyleagh, and a rousing defeat of title enemies Albert Foundry has lifted Downpatrick to the brink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began on Tuesday past when Kevin Trueman turned in a dream performance to destroy Kilmore Rec at Robert Adams Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rec were hoping to pinch some sort of result from their visitors in this their final match of the season, but instead they were put to the sword, 6-1, and chief executioner was hat-trick 'Shorty'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he had pilfered the opening goal on four minutes via a deflection from point blank range, a slight swivel setting up a positional stance, he made no mistake, the opportunity being created through Peter Telford's determined header.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kilmore capitulated. From then on it real-ly only became a matter of how many Downpatrick would score.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rec, still feeling nervous over relegation worries, suffered that sinking feeling although it took until the 33rd minute before Downpatrick registered again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time Shorty celebrated a goal of quality, vision and laser accuracy. Tony McShane delivered a majestic aerial ball that bypassed a hesitant home defence and the little, active striker flicked it high over the stranded Kieran Gordon who was left clawing air as the ball dropped millimetres under the crossbar and into the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Lennon might have scored for the Rec but fired wide in the ninth minute, the opportunity to haul his side level lost with his wayward shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tremendous tackle by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Peter Telford prevented an almost certain second goal for Downpatrick on 13 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two minutes later Neil Taggart was too hasty with his effort as Kilmore missed out again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Telford couldn't believe it when he headed fiercely down from Stevie Galbraith's corner, only to see the ball bounce back up over the bar on 21 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downpatrick continued to hunt in packs and Gordon came to Kilmore's rescue in the 26th minute with a brilliant diving save from the elusive Trueman whose venomous strike seemed destined for the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home faithful were now fearing the worst. They had every right to. Trueman's deadly dipper made it 2-0 and when the eager young Galbraith swept home two minutes into added on time, Downpatrick had the points won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both teams rang in the changes in the second half but this was Shorty's evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire Kilmore rearguard stood star-ry-eyed as the Downpatrick ace smashed in a speculative ball from the left and danced in delight as it zipped into the corner of the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim McStravick, as usual marshalled the Downpatrick defence in typical impressive fashion - he's been absolutely outstanding this season - superbly backed by the combative Johnny Cheevers and the blossoming Christian Holland. Andy Mac (McMenamin), even in his twilight playing years, competed with relish and enjoyment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Smyth and Philip Gill tried very hard to arouse a sleeping Rec, but nothing happened for the blues. Gary Kennedy's men were now involved in a damage limitation exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telford's raking free kick befuddled Gordon and it was 5-0 on 60 minutes. The big man, who yet again was the heartbeat of Downpatrick, was then taken off, obviously with the thought of the other two games to be played over the next five days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dale Davidson came on and within minutes helped himself to a fine goal as Downpatrick soared with delight and Kilmore slumped deeper into misery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York State Supreme Court justice's decision to acquit three police detectives in the November 2006 death of an unarmed man was stunning in its thorough absolution of the officers who fired 50 bullets at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two companions as they sat in a car outside a strip club. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman of the trial-level court found the three not guilty of all charges of manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment - even though one officer reloaded his gun to squeeze off 31 rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We respect Cooperman's verdict, but we do not believe all questions of accountability were resolved. Large questions remain about the New York Police Department. In recent years, when police have killed unarmed men, they have been, almost without exception, black. The detectives on trial said that they believed Bell, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield had a gun, and based on that suspicion they fired away. No gun was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, in 1999 police fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who was just reaching for his wallet. The acquittal of four police officers after that killing, which occurred during the racially challenged leadership of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, set off unrest in which scores were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger and disappointment are understandable now, but New York's leadership has changed, and community activists need to absorb that fact before they attempt to heat up reaction. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly are trying to correct the conditions that led to the Bell shooting, changes that take time and good faith on all sides. Both men have kept a schedule of outreach to minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progress has been steady. After the Bell shooting, Kelly ordered an independent study of department firearms training . The commissioner hopes to prevent ''reflexive shooting'' after one officer fires an initial shot. Detective Michael Oliver alone managed to fire 31 of the 50 rounds toward Bell's car - all in the few seconds following an initial shot from Gescard Isnora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The margin of error once shooting begins has become distressingly small. The police have come to favor fast, easy-to-fire weapons like 9mm semiautomatics. The rule that an officer is to pause and reassess after three shots can be forgotten in the heat of gunplay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also wonder why the police continue to put themselves and others in harm's way with undercover operations at places like strip clubs. The club where Bell spent the night before his scheduled wedding was reputed to be a haven for prostitutes, drug dealers and gun traders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his verdict, Justice Cooperman indicated that he found no carelessness or incompetence that rose ''to the level of criminal acts.'' We respect that judgment as a matter of law, but we see both carelessness and incompetence in the behavior of the police officers that must be corrected as a matter of public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time I almost shot someone, I wasn$apos;t that scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was 1986, and my partner and I had responded to a report of a man waving a knife inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal. When we arrived, I saw the knife in the man$apos;s outstretched arm. I drew my weapon, and I yelled at him to drop the knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My partner began inching his way toward the man, pleading with him to put the knife down. I made up my mind that I was going to shoot if the man lunged toward us. My partner got close enough to swing his nightstick down on the man$apos;s arm. The knife fell to the ground and we quickly handcuffed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why wasn$apos;t I scared? Because I could see the threat clearly; I knew what I was facing. There were plenty of other times during my 20-year police career, however, when I was afraid. Usually it was when I couldn$apos;t clearly see a potential suspect and didn$apos;t know if he had a weapon. For a police officer, if a suspect is ignoring your commands and you can$apos;t see his hands, you will feel that your life is in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the situation that faced the police detectives who shot and killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> outside the Club Kalua in Queens on Nov. 25, 2006. So I$apos;m glad that on Friday, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman was able to navigate through the rhetoric of the prosecution and acquit Detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper on manslaughter and all other charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was killed and two of his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were seriously wounded in a fusillade of 50 bullets. The police, who were conducting a prostitution sting, said that Bell tried to drive over an undercover detective. The officers fired because they thought one of the Bell party had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since no gun was found in the vehicle, it is clear that the police officers made a tragic mistake. They even violated department guidelines, which prohibit using deadly force against someone in a vehicle unless he is threatening an officer$apos;s life by means other than the vehicle, such as firing a gun at the same time. But in the end, what they did was not criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police officers are cleared of charges in a tragedy like the Bell shooting, or that of Amadou Diallo in 1999, critics will look elsewhere to assign blame. A common claim is that if the officers aren$apos;t to blame, the fault must lie in their training. This is nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the Diallo shooting, I was an instructor in the Police Department$apos;s in-service training unit. I trained more than 1,000 supervisors, using seminars and role-playing exercises in various subjects including deadly physical force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trust me: Training can instill good habits and safe tactics, but you can$apos;t control the level of fear, or the individual choice that a person makes about when to pull that trigger. In that position, an officer has seconds to make a life-altering decision: Is my life in imminent danger? How to answer that question can$apos;t be taught in a classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, I do believe that the first officer to fire his weapon in the Bell case, Isnora, carries a greater moral responsibility than the others. Once he fired, contagious shooting took hold, making it difficult for the others to stop. But this case was not about manslaughter or any other crime. It was about whether the judge believed Isnora when he told the grand jury that he felt his life and the lives of his team members were at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not many people will ever know what that feels like. Most police officers, myself included, never get shot or even discharge their guns. No one can fairly say that the detectives outside the Kalua were not in a dangerous situation. Some New Yorkers seem to think it wasn$apos;t quite dangerous enough. Well, they can debate that for an eternity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gescard Isnora wasn$apos;t afforded such leisure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most people exonerated at trial, this story would be over &ETH; but not for the police. The officers still face the prospect of federal charges and departmental punishment. It makes me very glad I didn$apos;t have to shoot that man in the Port Authority. Even though he had a knife, the police are always second- guessed when they use deadly physical force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his closing arguments last week, the prosecutor, Charles Testagrossa, said, $&quot;We ask the police to risk their lives to protect ours.$&quot; I agree. But they shouldn$apos;t have to gamble with them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver told his lawyer, James Culleton, that he &quot;felt horrible&quot; about having been the one to fire the fatal shots on Nov. 25, 2006.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said, 'I just can't believe it,' &quot; Culleton said Oliver told him.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, Queens prosecutors presented forensic evidence that showed one of the fatal shots entered Bell's right chest and another ripped through his liver.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver &quot;has to live with this for the rest of his life,&quot; the lawyer said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton said Oliver told him &quot;he hadn't even seen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the car&quot; and was focused on Bell's friend Joseph Guzman, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Guzman was shot and survived.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops thought Guzman was armed because Gescard Isnora, another plainclothes detective acquitted of manslaughter in the case last week, had heard Bell's friend say, &quot;Yo, go get my gun.&quot; The comment was overheard during a dispute outside a nearby strip club in Jamaica moments earlier.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see [Guzman] lifting his arms,&quot; Oliver told a grand jury last year. &quot;I didn't want to die. I reloaded the gun, and I continued to fire, and the shots still are going on around me.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton said Oliver was &quot;extremely nervous&quot; throughout the two-month trial over the possibility of facing 25 years behind bars if convicted of manslaughter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton, 59, has had experience successfully defending everyone from police officers to mobsters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He successfully represented Officer Richard Murphy, accused with three other cops of firing 41 shots in 1999 that killed African immigrant Amadou Diallo.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton, who entered private practice in 1985 after a 12-year stint with the Bronx DA's Office, also defended Vincent &quot;Chin&quot; Gigante, the Mafia boss famous for wandering the streets in his pajamas as he feigned madness.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about his success at defending police officers, Culleton said, &quot;For the most part, cops accused of crimes really aren't criminals.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Oliver, he said, &quot;Michael wants to move on with his life.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may be easier said than done.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton last night privately huddled with scores of local officials and community leaders at the Manhattan headquarters of the United Health Care Workers' Local 1199 - to which Bell's mom belongs - to plan protests that would include &quot;civil disobedience, boycotts and a major march on the Justice Department,&quot; Sharpton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wouldn't give specifics, saying only that he and his supporters would make their move within the next 10 days.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We agreed we have many different tactics,&quot; he said, flanked by Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, Guzman and another pal who was shot in the police fusillade, Trent Benefield.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers said teachers-union chief Randi Weingarten also was at the meeting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health-care-union President George Gresham vowed, &quot;We will be working . . . to make sure we educate people.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's dad, William, urged, &quot;No violence, but whatever it takes.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the detectives union, Michael Palladino, later issued a statement saying, &quot;The same legal system that grants people the right to lawful assembly has found our three detectives not guilty.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned Monday, after the acquittal of three city detectives in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, to again cast a gimlet eye on the men and women in blue.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intervening 24 years saw the Diallo and Bell cases, among others where New Yorkers died in arguably preventable confrontations with the police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also over that time, exactly 100 members of the New York City Police Department were murdered in the line of duty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a powerful number.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cite it not to excuse whatever errors of training or judgment occurred in the Bell tragedy - again, a judge disposed of the criminal charges - but to add context to the continuing debate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conyers' 1984 visit was part of a 17-month inquiry into what the then-chairman of the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice termed racism and police brutality here and in other big cities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing much came of that probe, and no surprise there - then (as now) Conyers' concerns had a certain rhetorical resonance, but not much substance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hundred murdered police officers, on the other hand, is a very substantial number indeed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One pushes paper at a base for Staten Island detectives. Another makes phone calls to investigators whenever there's a homicide in the Bronx. Four others perform administrative tasks at desks at various spots in Manhattan and Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are the lives of the six police officers involved in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although three of them -- Detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper -- were acquitted of criminal charges in Queens on Friday, they and their three colleagues are still facing the specter of a federal civil rights investigation, and the possibility of being brought up on departmental charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Therefore, all six officers remain in limbo, working without their guns and badges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's devoutly hoped that if the federal government is going to look at this, that they do so expeditiously and in good faith,'' said Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer for Officer Michael Carey, who was not indicted but is under the same scrutiny now as the three acquitted detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These officers deserve to have their careers taken off hold,'' Mr. Worth added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Erik Ablin, a spokesman for the Justice Department in Washington, declined to comment on the timing of the federal government's review of the Bell case. Officials in New York also said the fates of the officers were not something they could map with precision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But judging by past episodes, it could be a drawn-out, possibly years-long affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The decision by the judge in Queens, although favorable, is clearly not the end of this ordeal for these officers,'' said Francis X. Livoti, a former city police officer who was acquitted in 1996 in the Bronx of charges that he killed a man in 1994 by using a chokehold but was found guilty of violating departmental guidelines, fired in 1997 and convicted in 1998 of federal civil rights charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He served six and a half years in a federal prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, Mr. Livoti predicted that the federal investigation would conclude, without an indictment, within a year and that any separate departmental inquiry would be completed shortly thereafter. Lawyers for several of the officers involved agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, rather than ending the ordeal after 17 months, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman's verdict on Friday was a starting point for the six officers who remain on modified duty because of the case: Detectives Isnora, Oliver and Cooper; Detective Paul Headley; Officer Carey; and Lt. Gary Napoli. All but Lieutenant Napoli, their commanding officer, fired their guns that night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Besides the nitty-gritty review of the shooting, elected officials and the public are examining the officers' behavior in the wider context of police tactics, training and strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Justice Cooperman  wrote in clearing the three detectives of criminal charges: ''Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the Justice Department, arrived in the city to meet with those close to Mr. Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Conyers went to the office of Gregory W. Meeks, a member of Congress from Queens, where he met with seven other United States representatives, members of Mr. Bell's family and Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, two of Mr. Bell's friends who were wounded in the shooting. They met for about an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Afterward, Mr. Conyers said he had spoken to the United States attorney general, Michael B. Mukasey, about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm going back to work with our committee,'' Mr. Conyers said. ''We're going to be putting together the federal strategy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the attorney general's office announced it would be beginning its own investigation, but he declined to elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After making statements to reporters, many of those who attended the meeting drove to the Club Kalua, a few blocks from Congressman Meeks's office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman, Mr. Benefield and Mr. Bell's family stood in front of the club, on 94th Avenue, where Mr. Bell celebrated his bachelor party in November 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Conyers emerged into a steady rain. After briefly gazing at the club, he walked around a corner onto Liverpool Street, surrounded by  photographers and television camera operators. He paused at a spot where a memorial for Mr. Bell included flowers and candles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he walked back to his car, he was approached by Ken Frydman, a consultant to the Detectives' Endowment Association, who asked the congressman to meet with representatives from that group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Frydman told reporters afterward that Mr. Conyers seemed amenable to the idea. ''We'd like equal time,'' he said. ''We'd like to be heard.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officers involved will stand by, in the department's vernacular, on so-called desk duty. This can mean anything from fixing cars at a departmental tow garage to doling out new uniform shirts to rookies at the equipment section or shuffling paper files in a detective bureau's back office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, Detective Cooper is working in the detective bureau in the Bronx, Detective Isnora is working in the patrol bureau in northern Brooklyn, and Detective Oliver is working in Manhattan's detective bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also, Mr. Browne said, Detective Headley is working on Staten Island; Officer Carey is working in the patrol bureau in southern Manhattan; and Lieutenant Napoli is working in the 17th Precinct in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All six have been on modified duty since shortly after the shooting, Mr. Browne said, though Detectives Oliver, Isnora and Cooper were suspended without pay for 30 days from the time they were indicted in March 2007 until April 18, 2007, when they reverted to modified assignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One thing seems clear: Even if at the end of the process the officers involved in the shooting of Mr. Bell are cleared of all liability -- criminal, civil and departmental -- their careers as they knew them are likely over. None of them can reasonably be expected to ever carry a gun as a police officer in New York City, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Detective Headley, going without his weapon would be particularly ironic because he was a captain in the Army's military police who saw active duty in Kuwait in 2004 and 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Headley, said his client ''is cautiously optimistic that he and his fellow officers will be cleared after any additional scrutiny.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''Judge Acquits Detectives in 50-Shot Killing of Bell'' (front page, April 26):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting, acquitting all defendants of all charges, is sad, but probably inevitable. The detectives' claim that they believed that their lives were threatened was all that was necessary for Justice Arthur J. Cooperman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That the families of the victims should be appalled by this outcome is obvious. It flies in the face of our most honored principles of justice and fairness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But why should any of the rest of us feel less outraged or fearful? The verdict repudiates the very notion of police as protectors. We now see that the true intent of their oath is to ''serve and protect'' one another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If this situation is to change, we must compel police officers to hold our interests and our lives above their own. They must accept the threat of harm as part of their jobs and their oaths. And they must demonstrate restraint even at the expense of their lives. Our society is served only when they take bullets for us, not we for them. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''In Bell Case, Black New Yorkers See Nuances That Temper Rage'' (front page, April 27):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ''nuance'' that black New Yorkers see is hopelessness, as once again the judicial system confirms the worthlessness of black life in the eyes of those armed by the state, whatever their color. Perhaps when an upper-middle-class white kid is shot at 50 times and killed by the police without provocation, the judicial system and the mostly oblivious and silent white New Yorkers will recognize that unprovoked police abuse, violence and murder are real. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until then, young men of color should be clear that simply existing while black is just cause for their killing and protect their lives accordingly. We all should. As a 55-year-old black woman who has been an activist against police brutality for nearly four decades, I won't be joining in any protests against the verdict surrounded by heavily armed cops who are licensed to kill with impunity.</SPAN></P>

Murphy (''The Fear Behind the Badge,'' Op-Ed, April 27) quotes the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial prosecutor, Charles Testagrossa: ''We ask the police to risk their lives to protect ours,'' but adds his own opinion: ''I agree. But they shouldn't have to gamble with them.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Active crime-fighting is always a gamble from the time an officer heads out onto the street, through every job and arrest, especially in explosive domestic situations. Since cops are technically on duty 24 hours a day (if they live in the city), danger and risk are always potentially present. Those who never want to gamble (take serious risks) in an effort to save the lives of others -- bystanders, victims and even those who violate the law -- should find another line of work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because the Bell case defendants were acquitted of criminal charges does not mean that they acted responsibly or professionally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You had to wonder if the setting was somebody's misguided stab at irony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four hours after being absolved of criminal wrongdoing, the three police detectives put on trial in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stood last Friday before a battery of cameras and notebooks. They were in a conference room at the headquarters of their union, the Detectives' Endowment Association. The three men stood side by side for the benefit of photographers. Painted on the wall behind them was the union's circular logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Greatest Detectives in the World,'' it said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Oh, really? The greatest detectives in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Granted, those words were meant for the city's detectives as a unit. But they came close to mocking the grim reality of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case. No matter what they think of the judge's not-guilty verdict -- a brave and just decision or an indecipherable outrage -- few New Yorkers are likely to hail these three men as the greatest detectives in the city, let alone in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even the judge, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman of State Supreme Court, implied that he did not think much of their performance on that November night in 2006. Yes, he cleared them of criminal behavior. But he also referred not once but twice to ''carelessness and incompetence.'' Those damning words were not used lightly. But ''questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums,'' Justice Cooperman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ultimate forum has a name: Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner. You have to believe that he has thoughts about the future job prospects of Detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper, and perhaps also of their supervisors in the botched operation that ended with Mr. Bell's death in a 50-round fusillade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Understandably, Mr. Kelly is deflecting questions about his intentions. Other scenes must first be played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The federal government has to decide if civil rights charges are warranted, not that many people anticipate a federal case. There is also a civil suit brought by Mr. Bell's family and friends, and with it the excellent chance of the city's approving a multimillion-dollar settlement. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg himself said within days of the shooting that ''excessive force'' seemed to have been used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, the president of the detectives' union, Michael J. Palladino, criticized the mayor for having ''rushed to judgment.'' But Mr. Bloomberg's observation was then, and is now, the unrushed judgment of many New Yorkers, maybe most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're no longer in a court of law. We are, forgive the cliche, in the court of public opinion. There, as Mr. Kelly surely knows, the detectives may not fare so well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is hard to see how they keep their jobs, or, if they do manage to hang in, how they keep their guns. They are hopelessly damaged goods, like other officers in comparable cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To cite an example, only one of the four officers who killed Amadou Diallo in 1999 is still on the force, even though they were all acquitted of criminal charges. That officer, Kenneth Boss, is stuck on modified duty, what in a less enlightened era was called the bow-and-arrow squad. Don't bet on his ever getting his gun back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even when criminality and death are not at issue, the public expects minimum levels of sound judgment from those whom it arms as guardians of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 1998, Officer Joseph Locurto joined two firefighters on a float in a Labor Day parade held in Broad Channel, Queens. They forgot to bring along their brains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three men, all white, put on Afro wigs and blackface. They tossed fried chicken and watermelon to onlookers. One dangled from the back of the float, mocking the way a black man in Texas had been dragged to his death three months earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The city fired them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They sued to keep their jobs. Their tomfoolery, they said, was a commentary on racial attitudes in largely white Broad Channel, and they had exercised their right to free speech. In 2003, a federal judge in Manhattan agreed with them. But an appeals court reversed that decision two years ago. Mr. Locurto and Company are gone, and will stay gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obviously, that case and the Bell shooting are different on many levels. But they have one important thing in common. It boils down to a question of whether the city can safely, or sanely, put a gun in a police officer's hand and send him into the streets after he displayed judgment so flawed as to reasonably meet Justice Cooperman's standard of ''carelessness and incompetence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We suspect Mr. Kelly already has a fair idea of what he will do. The odds seem long against a finding that these are indeed the greatest detectives in the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Is Denounced in India</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India denounced the practice of aborting female fetuses, citing an ''alarming'' decline in the number of Indian girls for every 1,000 Indian boys. Mr. Singh called the practice a ''national shame,'' and called for tougher enforcement of laws meant to prevent doctors from helping parents avoid the birth of unwanted daughters.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FACTIONS REUNITE IN ZIMBABWE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The leaders of factions of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change of Zimbabwe formally reunited in a move that gives the group control of the Parliament for the first time in the nation's history. The two leaders have asked for Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's longtime president, to concede the national election, which was held in March but still has no official results. PAGE A7  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A TEST OF HONG KONG'S AUTONOMY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Olympic torch has been greeted with protests at many of its stops during the run-up to this summer's Games. But protests that may follow the torch relay as it enters Hong Kong later this week could be a preview of what protests during the Games would look like, and they have brought a new focus on Hong Kong's role as an autonomous territory of China.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A DASH FOR BRITAIN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thousands of migrants, mostly Afghans, Kurds and Eritreans, flock to Calais and other northern French ports each year, where they huddle in makeshift camps and try to dodge the police as they wait for the chance to make a dangerous crossing. French efforts to shut down the camps and arrest the migrants have done little to deter them from seeking a better future in Britain, drawn by the English language, the absence of national identity cards and the possibility of illegal work.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the last three decades, Harris County, Tex., which includes Houston, has executed more people than any other state in the country except Texas itself. A new study found that defendants who kill whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than those who kill blacks, which other studies on the death penalty have found. But the study also found that the race of the defendant plays a major role in explaining who is sentenced to death. Sidebar, Adam Liptak.  PAGE A10 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FIRST STIMULUS REBATES SENT OUT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Americans will begin seeing rebates from the federal government's $168 billion economic stimulus plans as early as this week, and the government ultimately to mail out 130 million rebates, with $600 for individuals and up to $1,200 for couples filing jointly. But there is still debate over how much the rebates will help bolster the economy, if at all.  PAGE A10 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AN ICONOCLAST STEPS DOWN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ernie Chambers, a black, divorced, agnostic former barber from Omaha, managed to climb to the seniormost position in the unicameral Legislature of Nebraska, a mostly rural, very conservative and mostly white state. Newly imposed term limits are forcing him to retire, and he believes the rule was created with him in mind. ''There will probably be so much joy in this corner of the world that it will be picked up on the Richter scale,'' he joked.  PAGE A10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBAMA DISTANCES FROM PASTOR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr., Senator Barack Obama's former pastor, has been making high-profile appearances to discuss some of the controversial comments he made, many of which have been a lingering problem for Mr. Obama's presidential campaign. Mr. Obama has attempted to distance himself for Mr. Wright, and held a hastily called news conference to underscore the point that his campaign and Mr. Wright are not working together.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kirk Kerkorian, the 90-year-old billionaire, is counting on the fortunes of the Ford Motor Company to turn around. His investment company acquired 100 million shares of Ford's stock, and said that it was planning to acquire another 20 million shares. In the past, Mr. Kerkorian used stakes in other automakers to push for changes in the way the company is run, but this time Mr. Kerkorian said he would remain on the sidelines. ''We're in this for purely passive investment purposes,'' said one of his senior advisers.  PAGE C1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A NEW PAPER VOWS TO BE DIFFERENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Middle East, media organizations are usually tightly controlled by the governments under which they operate and journalists who write critical stories are often thrown in jail. The royal family of Abu Dhabi, however, recently launched The National, an English-language daily that many in the Middle East and elsewhere are watching closely. And though those associated with the paper say that it will not be a voice of government, others wonder whether a government-owned paper can be truly be independent.  PAGE C3 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  RECESSION-PROOFED BY DIE-HARDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Grand Theft Auto IV is released, the latest installment in the violent and episodic video game franchise is expected to be one of the biggest video game launches ever. And even as the sluggish economy saps revenue from other industries, the video game industry is having a banner year, because market researchers say the target market is willing to to give up necessities to get their video game fix. ''I'd probably give up my cell phone,'' said one college student who plans on buying the game. ''Probably not food. That's really tough. I like food.''  PAGE C1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As other air carriers have begun merging, Glenn F. Tilton, the chief executive of United Airlines, has lobbied for the same, but has found no takers. Mr. Tilton has courted Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, and now that Continental has called off merger talks, Mr. Tilton is once again turning his attention to US Airways.  PAGE C1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lives of the six police officers involved in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remain in limbo. After three were acquitted of criminal charges, all six still face the specter of a federal civil rights investigation, and being brought up on departmental charges. Meanwhile, the Bell family and those close to Mr. Bell met with Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. PAGE B1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ONE MAN, THREE BROWNSTONES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When one Manhattan brownstone starts to feel confining, what is a modern-day tycoon to do? For Dr. Mitchell Blutt, who made his fortune on Wall Street, building up -- normally the only option on a cramped island -- would not suffice. So, he bought the two town houses east of his home on East 90th Street, with plans to combine all three into one big dwelling. But, neighbors and preservationists are not pleased. PAGE B1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Notre Dame's football team agreed to play Rutgers over the course of a six-game series, but it came with a catch: Rutgers ''home'' games against the Irish couldn't be played at Rutgers, but at a neutral venue. Rutgers preferred to play the games in its new $100 million, publicly funded stadium, which it has a hard time justifying in these tough budgetary times -- so it left the deal on the table. Still, that's a lot of hubris from Notre Dame, which was only a three-win team last year. Sports of the Times, Harvey Araton.   PAGE D1 </SPAN></P>

The city took its time rallying around the Hornets, the N.B.A franchise currently embarking on a dazzling playoff run. So what gives? The $8 tickets help. But Louisiana is football country.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why are beta blockers, drugs that are a common treatment for people with heart conditions, ineffective for so many black patients? Scientist have figured out the answer: black patients are much more likely than white patients to possess a gene that helps people create what amounts to their own version of beta blockers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal legislation could follow the acquittal of three detectives who fatally shot an unarmed black man in Queens last year, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan is suggesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nadler was among eight members of the House of Representatives who joined the Reverend Al Sharpton in a visit to the site of the shooting yesterday afternoon in an effort to pressure the Department of Justice to bring federal charges against the detectives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be moving on all avenues, in all lanes, to seek justice in this matter,&quot; Rep. Gregory Meeks, who called the meeting, said. &quot;One of those avenues is the federal government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nadler, who called the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;absolutely senseless,&quot; said the group would &quot;be looking to see what we can do - if it's a matter with the Justice Department, if it's a matter of perhaps changing the law so that this tragedy will not have occurred in vain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in the group was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. John Conyers Jr., who said he had spoken about the case with Attorney General Mukasey yesterday. The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into the case to determine whether to bring charges against the detectives under federal civil rights laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an important moment in the history of the criminal justice system in America,&quot; Mr. Conyers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officials including a possible mayoral hopeful, Comptroller William Thompson Jr., also joined the meeting, and Senator Clinton reportedly spoke to the group via conference call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton again promised nonviolent demonstrations across the city this week, although Mayor Bloomberg yesterday downplayed suggestions that protests would &quot;shut down the city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The city is doing fine,&quot; the mayor said, adding that he was &quot;proud&quot; of the peaceful reaction so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reverend also disputed the assessment of some civil rights experts who have suggested that federal charges are unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are confident we can beat the odds here,&quot; Rev. Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>

Al Sharpton, who accused the presidential candidate of trying to &quot;grandstand in front of white people,&quot; sources told The Post.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During what a source described as a &quot;heated&quot; phone call yesterday, Sharpton told Obama he was disappointed with the Illinois senator's words on Friday, when Obama said &quot;resorting to violence to express displeasure&quot; was &quot;completely unacceptable and counterproductive.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Obama] issues this statement and not a single rock had been thrown,&quot; said a source. &quot;How does the candidate of change ask people to accept a verdict that is unjust?&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said Sharpton had hoped Obama would &quot;side with the Bell family&quot; and not use it as an &quot;opportunity to grandstand in front of white people.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Obama spokesman described the conversation as a chance to &quot;hear [Sharpton's] views and to get his perspective.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton ratcheted up the pressure on federal prosecutors yesterday by bringing Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to Kalua, the Queens strip club where the Nov. 25, 2006 shooting took place.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to put together a federal strategy on how to deal with the case,&quot; Conyers said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also yesterday, Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, who rendered the not-guilty verdict, refused to comment on his decision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said what he had to say on the bench,&quot; his law clerk said.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Daily News is reporting that the former major leaguer had a 10-year affair with country singer Mindy McCready beginning when she was 15 and he was 28 (starting around 1990).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mindy, country's equivalent of Britney Spears, is trying to get her life and career right after some problems in both areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Roger confirmed through his lawyer that he and Mindy had a relationship but that it wasn't sexual, reports the NYDN. He considered her a family friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, the two reportedly met at a bar in Florida where Mindy was singing and Roger and some of his Red Sox teammates were hanging out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know we haven't heard the last of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of folks we haven't heard the last of, Britney's baaaack!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know it was only a matter of time before our favorite tarnished pop-star mom was back filming another episode of &quot;How I Met Your Mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show got much hype and big ratings the first time around, so her return was a no-brainer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive producer and co-creator Craig Thomas said, &quot;We're all so thrilled to have Britney joining us once again. And just to head it off at the pass this time around: Yes, Mom, Britney's very nice, and no, I can't get her autograph for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have had their share of high-profile romances, so this might not be much of anything, but we are always cheering for our girl Jen. We'll just have to wait and see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also want to know: What's up with Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two have been hanging pretty tight lately, and Ms. Carey is sporting a huge rock on the ring finger of her left hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know Nick had a widely publicized engagement to Victoria Secret model Selena Eubanks, but the two never made it to the altar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, everybody's buzzing about Nick and Mariah, especially after seeing them hold hands at the party after the premiere of her new flick, &quot;Tennessee,&quot; reports People.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the mag asked Nick what he loved about Mariah, he said, &quot;Everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds like love to us!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither star's reps could be reached to answer questions about a possible engagement, so, as with Jen and John, we can't hurry love, we'll just have to wait.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want you to tell me how I can trust the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Attorney General, the question is for you. And you too, Ms. Police Officer, Madame District Attorney and Mr. Judge. It is also for you, Mr. and Ms. Average Citizen. I realize this will be an engraved invitation for those crackpots who get their jollies flouting their hatefulness and ignorance on electronic message boards, and I'm willing to live with that because the question, I assure you, is in earnest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody tell me: How can I trust the justice system? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will think this is about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the unarmed black man who died in a fusillade of 50 bullets from New York police on what was to have been his wedding day; the shooters were acquitted last week. But the question isn't about Bell, at least not solely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, it's about the fact that the justice system so often seems to have less justice in it where black people are concerned. It's about Amadou Diallo, shot at 41 times -- hit 19 -- by New York police while reaching for his wallet. It's about Rodney King, beaten to pieces by L.A. police for a traffic violation. It's about Arthur McDuffie, beaten to &quot;death&quot; by Miami police for a traffic violation. It's about Jeffrey Gilbert, bones fractured by police who broke into the Greenbelt, Md., apartment of his girlfriend and pounced on him as he lay nude in bed because they mistakenly thought him a cop killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's about L.A. police manufacturing and planting evidence. It's about my son, stopped by police for driving with an &quot;obstructed&quot; windshield -- he had an air freshener in the shape of a Christmas tree dangling from his rear-view mirror. It's about studies documenting the enduring racial bias in our justice system so that, for example, blacks account for 13 percent of all regular drug users, but 35 percent of those arrested, 55 percent of those convicted and 74 percent of those imprisoned for drug possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's about knowing the foregoing will be greeted with blithe indifference by those who find it convenient to believe the unjust treatment of blacks is somehow excusable, understandable, merited or required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I need no lectures to remind me that good people inhabit the system; my cousin is a federal prosecutor. Nor do I need any lectures on the heroism of cops; I've ridden with police, been protected by them and yield to no one in my admiration for those who do that job with honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So save the lectures, just give me an answer: How can I trust a system whose biases against people who look like me are simultaneously well-documented, yet happily ignored by those who resemble me not at all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question matters, because without trust, the system doesn't work. Everybody came down, and justifiably so, on the idiot rapper who said last year that he would not call police even if a serial killer were living next door. Unfortunately, fewer people bothered to ask where such profound distrust comes from. Fewer still bothered to ask what it leads to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People don't participate in systems they don't trust. They don't come forward, they don't testify. So criminals go uncaptured, and crimes unpunished. Yet some black people apparently find that preferable to participating in a system they believe is rigged against them. I don't agree with them, but before you condemn them, ask yourself: Would you play in a game refereed by someone who hated you? What's the point?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In games as in life, you may not like an outcome, but if you believe it was fairly derived, you can at least live with it. Small wonder black people often find it difficult to live with this system. Last week's acquittal will do nothing to change that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I'm serious. Somebody tell me how I can trust American justice. Somebody tell me why I should even try.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - A coalition of civil rights advocates on Sunday urged changes in the handling of police misconduct and brutality complaints after the acquittal of three officers involved in the death of an unarmed man shot on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called for a permanent state-level special prosecutor to investigate such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case proves it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute cases of police misconduct, especially in homicide cases,&quot; said lawyer Norman Siegel, former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict underscores the need for systemic change in the way New York handles these important and at times high profile cases, and to improve community relations,&quot; said Siegel, an outspoken advocate on civil rights and law enforcement issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three city police officers were cleared Friday in the November 2006 shooting death of shooting death of Bell outside a night club where he had just left his bachelor party. Two friends were wounded in the volley of 50 shots; the officers charged said they thought they were in mortal danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegel was joined at a news conference outside police headquarters by state Sen. Eric Adams and retired police officer Marq Claxton. Adams and Claxton co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams, a former police captain, said the state-level special prosecutor's office should be reinstated permanently by law. A previous special prosecutor's office was created by former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller in 1974 but abolished in 1993 by Gov. Mario Cuomo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special prosecutor should have power to investigate allegations of police misconduct and brutality, as well as corruption, they said. The previous office was created primarily as a result of corruption exposes in the NYPD, and that was its primary focus, Siegel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They looked the other way on cases of brutality,&quot; Siegel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams also urged passage of legislation to give the state attorney general's office power to take immediate control of a crime scene in cases like the Bell shooting to make sure all evidence is preserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe a police department involved in a shooting should be responsible for the crime scene,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegel and Adams said they looked for support on the issues from Gov. David Paterson, who recently replaced the disgraced Gov. Eliot Spitzer, saying that as a legislator and minority rights spokesman Paterson had been a strong voice in previous police shooting controversies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erin Duggan, a spokeswoman for Paterson, said the governor had learned of the proposals only from media reports and would review them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He &quot;takes the issue of police wrongdoing very seriously, but he also believes that the overwhelming majority of police officers perform their duties honorably and conscientiously each and every day,&quot; Duggan said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- The fiancee of an unarmed black man shot dead by police on his wedding day said the justice system ``let me down'' by acquitting the three detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slaying fuelled allegations of racism and excessive force by police, although two of the officers charged were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``They killed Sean all over again,'' Nicole Paultre Bell said. ``That's what it felt like to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'm still praying for justice, because it's not over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of the victims have sued the city, and the officers also face possible departmental charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Bell stormed out of court after the NYPD detectives were cleared of charges over 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> killing in a hail of 50 gunshots outside a Queens strip club in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, more than 300 people marched through Harlem; 50 carried white placards bearing numbers for the shots fired at Mr Bell and his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev Al Sharpton lambasted the judge who acquitted the detectives, saying a jury should have decided. He's threatened to ``shut the city down''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman said inconsistent evidence, the demeanour and rap sheets of the prosecution witnesses -- mainly Mr Bell's friends -- ``had the effect of eviscerating'' their credibility. None of the officers took the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 shots, wept as did Mr Bell's mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of ``Murderers! Murderers!'' and ``KKK!'' rang out outside court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell was killed as he left his bachelor party. The undercover cops said they thought one man had a gun; no gun was found.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three US detectives were acquitted of all charges yesterday in the 50-shot killing of an unarmed groom-to-be on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a New York courtroom packed with spectators including victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fiancee and parents, and at least 200 people gathered outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's fiancee immediately walked out of the room; his mother cried and gasps were heard throughout the room. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Not guilty!&quot; erupted outside the court and dozens of people began crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old black man, was killed in a hail of gunfire outside a strip club in Queens on November 25 2006 - his wedding day - as he was leaving his stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver (36) and Gescard Isnora (29) stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Marc Cooper (40) was charged only with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver fired 31 shots, Isnora fired 11 rounds and Cooper shot four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge indicated that the police officers' version of events was more credible than the victims' version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conviction on manslaughter could have brought up to 25 years in prison; the penalty for reckless endangerment, is a year behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's fiancee, parents and their supporters have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence painted the victims as drunken thugs who the officers believed were armed and dangerous. Prosecutors sought to convince the judge that the victims had been minding their own business and that the officers were inept, trigger-happy aggressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers took the witness stand. Instead, Justice Cooperman heard transcripts of the officers testifying, saying they believed they had good reason to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also heard testimony from Mr Bell's companions - Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman - who insisted the incident erupted without warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Benefield and Mr Guzman were both wounded - Mr Guzman still has four bullets lodged in his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims and defendants were set on a fateful collision course by a pair of innocuous decisions: Mr Bell's to have a last-minute stag party at Kalua Cabaret, and the undercover detectives' to investigate reports of prostitution at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the club closed around 4am, Sanchez and Isnora claimed they overheard Mr Bell and his friends first flirt with women, then taunt a stranger who responded by putting his right hand in his pocket as if he had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Guzman, they testified, said: &quot;Yo, go get my gun&quot; - something Mr Bell's friends denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora said he decided to arm himself, call for backup and tail the trio as they went around the corner and got into Mr Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that after warning the men to halt, Mr Bell pulled away and rammed an unmarked police van with Oliver at the wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective also alleged that Mr Guzman made a sudden move as if he were reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tyres screeching, glass breaking and bullets flying, the officers claimed that they believed they were the ones under fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver responded by emptying his semiautomatic pistol, reloading, and emptying it again, as the supervisor dived for cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth emerged when the smoke cleared - there was no weapon inside Mr Bell's blood-splattered car.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathaniel Dickson, 18, was arrested Saturday night at a home in Belton about 20 miles from where the bodies of his father, stepmother, stepsister and younger brother were found, authorities said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of angry New Yorkers marched through Harlem on Saturday after civil rights activist Al Sharpton promised to &quot;close this city down&quot; to protest against the acquittals of three police officers who killed a young groom on his wedding day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to an overflow crowd outside his National Action Network office, Mr Sharpton said: &quot;This city is going to deal with the blood of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strategically know how to stop the city, so people stand still and realise that you do not have the right to shoot down unarmed, innocent civilians,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police killed Mr Bell, 23, and wounded two of his friends in a 50-shot barrage outside a Queens strip club in November 2006, just hours before his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Justice Arthur Cooperman acquitted the three detectives who pulled the triggers on the group, after presiding over a non-jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sharpton did not specify exactly what type of action he would initiate to protest against the acquittals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that Mr Bell's supporters could demonstrate all over New York, from Wall Street to the home of Justice Cooperman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting behind Mr Sharpton as he spoke were Mr Bell's parents, William and Valerie, his sister and Nicole Paultre Bell, who took her fiance's name after his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Paultre Bell said: &quot;The justice system let me down, they killed Sean all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Cops Against Police Brutality founder and president Delacy Davis commented: &quot;The moment that the officers requested and received a non-jury trial, we knew that they would not be found guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've seen this consistent pattern of abuse in the system,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Hip Hop Caucus president Lennox Yearwood, who works to boost the involvement of young black people in progressive politics, fumed: &quot;We have not been witnesses to fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans as is stated in the mission of the Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the mission of the Department of Justice and rule of law is being broken, then the integrity of the institution and system is lost and there is no rule of law,&quot; Mr Yearwood observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;When there is no rule of law, people will organise themselves to work for justice as a means to protect themselves out of necessity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circle of people was thin but spread wide, looping an intersection in the heart of Harlem on Sunday and blocking long lines of cars and buses in four directions. In the middle of the circle stood a cluster of angry people, and in that cluster stood a young man with a bullhorn and a question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why isn't everyone else out here with us?'' the man, Robert Cuffy, 22, asked. The circle of people, roughly 150 strong, stared back. It was two days after a judge acquitted three New York City detectives in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who died on the morning of his wedding day 17 months ago after the detectives fired a total of 50 bullets at his car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unlike some previous verdicts in police shootings, the acquittals in the Bell case have so far been largely met with a muted response. Thousands of protesters did not fill the streets, no unrest ensued. Still, on Sunday, some protesters and advocates around the city demanded federal investigations into the case and greater oversight of the police, while others puzzled over why the verdict had not yielded a stronger response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a news conference at the Harlem headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, Mr. Sharpton and other activists, politicians and community leaders praised the overall peaceful response that followed the verdict, and vowed to fight the judge's decision in strategic rather than bellicose ways. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Some in the media seemed disappointed, they wanted us to play into the hoodlum, thug stereotypes,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''We can be angry without being mad.'' And while many onlookers shouted their support, others admitted restlessness and a yearning for something more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People are hungry for leadership that's not there,'' said Calvin B. Hunt Jr., who listened to the news conference and joined the protest that followed, marching down Malcolm X Boulevard and blocking the intersection at 125th Street. He spoke longingly of prominent black activists in the 1960s and 1970s, among them Malcolm X, Angela Davis and Huey Newton. ''After the Amadou Diallo verdict, we marched till we had corns on our feet, and nothing changed,'' he said. ''In this verdict, there was no justice. So why should there be peace?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His sentiments were shared by some others in the crowd. A poet who gave his name as Thug Love said gang members from the Bloods and Crips should unite to ''police and protect their own community'' the way the Black Panthers did decades ago. A concert promoter, who goes by the name Goddess Isis, said that the news conference sounded to her like ''politics as usual,'' and that the community needed grass-roots leaders with concrete solutions to ongoing problems, like police harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are on our own here,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Nkrumah Pierre, a banker who lives on Long Island and who marched in the protest  on Sunday, said: ''We've progressed to the point where we don't need to act out in violence. This is an intelligent protest, and a strategic protest.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, others on Sunday called for changes within the system, in particular the ways in which the city's police are monitored. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a news conference outside Police Department headquarters in Lower Manhattan, civil rights advocates and lawmakers -- including Norman Siegel, the former executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union; State Senator Eric Adams of Brooklyn; and Marq Claxton of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care -- called for the appointment of a permanent statewide special prosecutor, to supersede district attorneys in cases of police shootings or alleged police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Too often, the advocates said, district attorneys have close relationships with the police, muddying prosecutorial independence. The advocates also said the timing of the proposal was influenced by the ascension of David A. Paterson to governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For the first time we realistically have someone in the governor's seat that understands the need for these reforms,'' Mr. Siegel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The proposal, Mr. Siegel said, was loosely patterned on the former Office of the Special State Prosecutor for Corruption, created under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller in the early 1970s on the recommendation of the Knapp Commission, which uncovered corruption in the Police Department. That office was disbanded in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Mr. Paterson, said the governor would review the recommendation. ''Like all New Yorkers, the governor takes the issue of police wrongdoing very seriously, but he also believes that the overwhelming majority of police officers perform their duties honorably and conscientiously,'' Ms. Heller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Harlem, one of the protesters, Melanie Brown, who is 29 and lives near the street in Queens where Mr. Bell was killed and two of his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were wounded, said she believed that every response, no matter how seemingly small, helped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What happens next happens,'' she said, as protesters chanted and hoisted aloft Pan-African flags, striped in red, black and green. ''Right now this is a unity thing.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the next steps in the case of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will, it appears, be a decision by America on whether to bring a civil rights case against the police detectives the state of New York had just concluded were not guilty. The civil rights laws America would be using were brought onto the books to help defeat Jim Crow, when it was possible for a white man who killed a black man to be placed in the dock without actually being in jeopardy of losing his own life or limb. This is why it was not a violation of the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy for such a killer to be tried a second time by the federal government on civil rights charges for the same criminal act. In the south of Jim Crow, there had not been jeopardy in the first instance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, however, going to be passing difficult for the federal government to conclude that the officers acquitted Friday of murdering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were not in genuine jeopardy when they went before Judge Cooperman. A lot of things can be said about Judge Cooperman, but one thing that cannot be said about him is that he is a racist or that he was unprepared to find the defendants guilty if the evidence demanded it. The same can be said of the district attorney of Queens County, Richard Brown. He tried his level best to gain a guilty verdict on Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora, and Marc Cooper. So between a high quality judge and a determined prosecution, there is no doubt that the three officers were in genuine jeopardy before the law. Once an acquittal is brought in, the Constitution requires that it be the end of the criminal phase of this tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't, however, mean the end of the story. There is no doubt going to be civil litigation for damages. There is going to be a determination made by the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, in respect of the careers of the three officers. There have already been extensive reviews of police procedures to make it less likely that an unarmed individual can be gunned down in a hail of bullets fired by police officers. And there is going to have to be a constant political effort in our city between the administration and the minority community. We have never felt that the demagogues speak for large numbers, but neither do we discount the danger of a growing cynicism. It is not a small thing that an innocent individual was gunned down by police officers on the streets of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a obverse danger of which the city needs also to stay aware - namely that the police will lose their nerve and their aggressiveness. We have lived, during the mayoralties of Rudolph Giuliani and Mr. Bloomberg, in an era of plunging crime rates. Under Mr. Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly, crime has fled so thoroughly that the city is the safest large city in America. At a time of economic uncertainly and possible recession, confident policing will be at a premium. Absent that, all that we have built in the years since September 11, 2001, will be at risk. The mayor spoke well after the verdict when he said, &quot;All of us have a responsibility to improve our neighborhoods and our City, and we can only do that by working together, respecting each other, and doing everything possible to prevent future tragedies and injustices.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups are aiming to rouse the activist side of Governor Paterson this week in the aftermath of a not guilty verdict for three detectives who killed an unarmed black man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubting that federal prosecutors will bring new civil rights charges against the detectives, the activists are resting their hopes for action on the former state senator from Harlem, who once protested alongside them after the 1999 shooting of another unarmed black man, Amadou Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paterson was arrested for civil disobedience during the Diallo protests on almost the same spot where yesterday a civil rights lawyer, Norman Siegel, a state senator, Eric Adams, and leaders of a civil rights group, 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, called on him to use his new power as governor to make changes to a system they say is ineffective in punishing police brutality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the changes proposed by the activists are ones Mr. Paterson himself has called for in the past, including the creation of a permanent post for an independent state prosecutor to investigate and prosecute police corruption and brutality - a post the governor has the power to create.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't think of anyone better,&quot; Mr. Siegel, the former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said of Mr. Paterson. &quot;If we don't get it in the next year-and-a-half or two years, we will probably never get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate news conference yesterday at the headquarters of the National Action Network in Harlem, the Rev. Al Sharpton seemed to have greater hopes that federal prosecutors would file charges against the detectives. Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre Bell, also promised to lead the protests Rev. Sharpton has promised would shut down the city in the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The justice system let me down,&quot; Ms. Bell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton said he is meeting today with the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, to discuss the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure on Mr. Paterson to take up his old cause following the Bell verdict poses a difficult test that juxtaposes the governor's longtime roots as a civil rights activist and the political considerations of his new office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists are convinced that Mr. Paterson will line up on their side, however, citing his activism in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor was among a group of lawmakers and activists who, in the wake of the Diallo shooting, presented a list of 10 demands that are the inspiration for the five proposals activists presented yesterday. They include the appointment of the special prosecutor, an overhaul of the review board that investigates complaints against police, regular town hall meetings to discuss police misconduct cases, a raise in starting pay for police officers, and the institution of regular police psychological testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paterson has spoken in the past at the National Action Network and is also reported to have donated as much as $16,000 to Rev. Sharpton's organization in the past few years, according to a 2007 report by the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Diallo shooting in some ways has served as a touchstone for the Bell case. Diallo was killed in a hail of 41 bullets as he was reaching for his wallet. Fifty bullets were fired at Bell as he was leaving his bachelor party at a Queens strip club with a group of friends on the morning of his wedding in late 2006. In both cases, the police officers were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Paterson was arrested during the Diallo protests - one of three reported arrests in his life on civil disobedience charges for civil rights causes - he was quoted in the Amsterdam News as saying: &quot;99% of African-Americans feel that police brutality is a problem in New York City and 70% of white New Yorkers do not. While we respect that their opinions are shaped by their personal experiences, we feel that for anyone to treat the concerns expressed by 3 million New Yorkers as merely politically motivated ... shows a blatant disregard for the people of our community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, while running for lieutenant governor alongside Eliot Spitzer, Mr. Paterson abandoned a bill he introduced in the aftermath of the Diallo shooting that would have required police to use minimum force - meaning shooting to wound, not kill. Police and other officials had roundly criticized the bill, saying it would make the job more dangerous for police officers, and the bill seemed to contradict his running mate's past efforts to help police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, responding to the activists' calls for him to take action, a spokeswoman for the governor, Erin Duggan, said Mr. Paterson had not yet received a copy of the proposals but that &quot;he will of course review them carefully and consider the complex issues they address.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Governor takes the police wrongdoing very seriously, but he also believes that the overwhelming majority of police officers perform their duties honorably and conscientiously each and every day,&quot; she said in a statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, who acquitted three cops in the shooting death of an unarmed bridegroom, said he wouldn't answer any questions about the case on his own time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said the pool press people will talk to him from 9 to 5,&quot; said an officer at the judge's Queens house. &quot;He doesn't want anyone on his property.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry demonstrators blocked Harlem traffic yesterday to protest the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict in the first step of what community activists billed as a wave of civic disruptions aimed at shutting down New York.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gathering in large circles at intersections to create human roadblocks, the crowd of more than 100 demonstrators gave a preview of the civil disobedience organizers vowed would bring the city to a standstill.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police kept a close watch on the protesters, who marched through streets amid talk of protests aimed at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and Broadway theaters.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing it because it's a national problem,&quot; said Salaam Ismial, head of the National United Youth Council, which organized yesterday's protest. &quot;Our young people don't have any confidence in the judicial system.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest was in response to a judge's decision to acquit NYPD Detectives Gescard Isnora, Marc Cooper and Michael Oliver in the shooting death of Bell, who was gunned down with his friends as they left his Queens bachelor party, just hours before his wedding. The Rev. Al Sharpton was not at the rally, but a spokeswoman said he gave it his blessing. Also missing from the protest was Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, who has vowed to lead the fight for justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ismial said he had no ties to Sharpton or Paultre-Bell.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motorists in Harlem appeared to take the delays in stride.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as there's no violence, it gives them an opportunity to express their view,&quot; said Brian Kapchan, 48, a real-estate broker. &quot;Even though I was delayed, 15 minutes is not the end of the world.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, some of the same demonstrators filled a Harlem storefront, where community and civil-rights leaders attacked Friday's verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they were vocal about their calls for a US Department of Justice inquiry and changes in police procedure, they were secretive about their plans for mass civil disobedience.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will not be the normal stuff,&quot; said Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, who is advising Bell's family and friends.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since this has gone to a new level, we will respond at a new level.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the items on the agenda is a meeting with House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers (D-Michigan), who will call for a federal probe, and a Midtown meeting tomorrow of national civil-rights leaders in what was billed as a strategy session.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's time for the world to know we're not going to tolerate this type of behavior,&quot; said Charles Steele, executive director of the Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil-rights group founded by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though we're here in New York, we're up South. Nothing has changed,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile in Brooklyn, officials pulled police officers off of foot patrols after a confidential informant warned them of a plot to shoot a cop, officials said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking-beat cops from the 81st, 83rd and 75th precincts were transferred to radio cars, and department heads circled the wagons to protect the stations from any attack, according to a source.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transfer was lifted last night, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said they had not established a direct link between the verdict and the alleged threat but were not taking any chances.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coalition of civil-rights advocates called yesterday for the creation of a permanent state special prosecutor to investigate suspected cases of police misconduct and brutality.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, which includes Norman Siegel, former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, and state Sen. Eric Adams, an ex-cop, told a news conference they expect Gov. Paterson will support their proposal.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegel said Friday's verdict acquitting three detectives in the slaying of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a hail of 50 bullets &quot;proves it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute cases of police misconduct, especially in homicide cases.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict underscores the need for systemic change in the way New York handles these important and, at times, high-profile cases,&quot; he added.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller created a state special prosecutor's office in 1974, but it was abolished in 1993 by then-Gov. Mario Cuomo.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams (D-Brooklyn) said the office should be permanently reinstated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are just as responsible for what happened [in the Bell killing] because, although the officers discharged their guns, we loaded the bullets. Our failures loaded the gun,&quot; he said, holding a .38-caliber bullet.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two spoke as Bell's mother, Valerie, visited the Community Church of Christ in Jamaica - where her son was to have been married - and church officials gave out NYCLU pamphlets listing 14 things to do if you're stopped by cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegel and Adams said they expected Paterson to support them because he had been a strong voice in previous police shootings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- With AP </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What To Do If You're Stopped By The Police </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Stay calm and in control of your words, body language and emotions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Don't get into an argument with the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Remember, anything you say or do can be used against you. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Keep your hands where the police can see them. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Al Sharpton walked off the stage at his National Action Network headquarters in Harlem this weekend, television cameramen and reporters packed up their things and left too. But Terrell Taylor picked up his camera and got to work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor is a 38-year-old filmmaker who is working on a documentary about Sharpton, the National Action Network and the modern civil right movement. After filming Sharpton for a project focusing on the 40th anniversary of the civil rights movement, Taylor said he approached Sharpton about doing a second project. And Sharpton, not usually one to shy away from reporters, was more than obliging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton has granted Taylor and his six-man-crew access that includes lots of exclusive footage of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Taylor, &quot;We were with the family 48 until the verdict. So, we had an opportunity to sit down while they ate their last dinner before the verdict, while they went to church and prayed. Also at the vigils. We were actually there at the breakfast before the trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor thinks Sharpton makes for an excellent cinematic character. &quot;He can call Hillary Clinton. He can call Barack Obama. He can call the governor of New York,&quot; said Taylor. &quot;He can call the community to come together.&quot; (Taylor said he doesn't have footage of Sharpton speaking in person with Clinton or Obama, but has seen him on the phone with them.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">semi finals of the Doubles Competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first of theDoubles competition semi finals, Paul Illidge (Total Confusion) had to play on his own as his partner Graham Ridgway was on holiday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no surprise that it resulted in a 2-0 win for opponents Chris Taylor and Mark Thompson (Halfway A).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second semi final also resulted in a 2-0 scoreline with the current holders of the trophy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Graham Littlemore (Navvy), beating Steve Massey and Wally Nethercott (Halfway A).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next came the final of the Executive competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holders of the trophy, Halfway Gents, won the opening game thanks to Anthony Hall but the scores were levelled when Eric Silcock (RAOB Buffs) won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response for the latter proved to be shortlived, however, for Halfway Gents then took the next four games to put them into an unassailable 5-1 lead with wins from Steve McKay, Brian Whitby, Paul Edwards and Karl Whitfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Ellis then won for RAOB Buffs but the last two games went in favour of Halfway Gents with wins from Peter Bellfield and Keith Massey to make the final score 7-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Play was concluded on Thursday night with the final of the Doubles competition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday night's action began with a play-off in the Highest Score competition, which was won by Mike O'Dwyer (Roundhouse).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next came the semi finals of the Individual competition and in the first of these Karl Windisch (Halfway A) progressed to the final with a 2-0 win against former champion, Steve Roberts (Tricorn), with Karl finishing the first leg in 17 darts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first leg in the second semi final went in favour of Adie Heathcote (Navvy), but the scores were tied when with the aid of a maximum Steve Shackleton (Tricorn) took the second leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tense decider, it was Adie who hit the all-important finishing double and so progressed to the final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These semi finals were followed by the final of the Town Championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roundhouse set the early running when they won the first three games with wins from Keith Worthington, Mike Hassey and John Glover, but Tricorn hit back in fine style when they took the next five games to make certain of the championship with wins from Neil Connor, Steve Shackleton, Steve Roberts, Ian King and Dave Roberts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIERRA MADRE, Calif. Firefighters gained ground Sunday against an early season wildfire that slowly chewed its way through dense brush near Los Angeles, forcing more than 1,000 people from homes in the foothills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 500 firefighters attacked the 400-acre fire, aided by two helicopters and water-dropping air tankers, said Elisa Weaver, spokeswoman for the city of Sierra Madre. Residents evacuated at least 550 homes Saturday night and Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crews had the fire 30 percent contained by Sunday evening, Sierra Madre spokesman James Carlson said. Light winds and rising humidity were aiding firefighters, who hoped to have the blaze fully contained within four to seven days, Carlson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aircraft were also helping fire officials assess the movement of the blaze, which was being pushed northwest into Angeles National Forest, said Batallion Chief Tim Davis of the Forest Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police-shooting acquittal spurs calls for changes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK A coalition of civil rights advocates on Sunday urged changes in the handling of police misconduct and brutality complaints after the acquittal of three officers involved in the shooting death of an unarmed man on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called for a permanent state-level special prosecutor to investigate such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case proves it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute cases of police misconduct, especially in homicide cases,&quot; said lawyer Norman Siegel, former head of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict underscores the need for systemic change in the way New York handles these important and at times high profile cases, and to improve community relations,&quot; said Siegel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three city police officers were cleared Friday in the November 2006 shooting death of Bell outside a nightclub where he had just left his bachelor party. Two friends were wounded in the volley of 50 shots fired by undercover officers and colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers charged said they thought they were in mortal danger, but no gun was found in Bell's car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siegel was joined at a news conference outside police headquarters by state Sen. Eric Adams and retired police officer Marq Claxton. Adams and Claxton co-founded 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams, a former police captain, said the state-level special prosecutor's office should be reinstated permanently by law. A previous special prosecutor's office was created by former Gov. Nelson Rockefeller in 1974 but abolished in 1993 by Gov. Mario Cuomo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teen arrested in slaying of four family members </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EASLEY, S.C. A teenager who had recently moved back home after breaking up with his live-in girlfriend is accused of gunning down and killing four family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathaniel Dickson, 18, was arrested Saturday night at a home in Belton, S.C., about 20 miles from where the bodies of his father, stepmother, stepsister and younger brother were found, authorities said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities would not talk about a possible motive. &quot;I'm going to have this case tried in the courtroom, not out on the streets,&quot; Anderson County Sheriff David Crenshaw said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dickson's father was found shot early Saturday in the yard of his one-story house in a wooded neighborhood just outside of Easley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Andrew Dickson Jr., 46, died as paramedics arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers then went inside and found the bodies of his wife, Martiza Hurtado Dickson, 46; Melissa Giliam Salazar, 19; and Taylor Dickson, 14. All had been shot to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, D.C., to begin bicycle-sharing service </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON More Washingtonians could be pedaling to meetings on Capitol Hill and other appointments when the city launches the nation's first European-style bike-sharing service next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program, called SmartBike D.C., is similar to car-sharing services like Zipcar. Users must sign up for a $40 annual membership to gain access to a network of bikes stored at computerized racks around the city. To unlock the bike, users simply scan their access cards. The bikes can be used for up to three hours at a time and can be returned at any SmartBike station. In the beginning at least, there won't be any hourly charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The District of Columbia program is starting small, with just 10 stations and 120 bikes. In contrast, Paris started its service last summer with more than 10,600 bikes at 750 stations. But D.C. officials are eager to expand it quickly if the response is good. Proponents say the program easily could be expanded to more than 1,000 bikes at more than 100 stations within a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one more transportation option for residents, visitors and workers,&quot; said Jim Sebastian, who runs the D.C. Department of Transportation's bicycle programs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strategically know how to stop the city so people stand still and realize that you do not have the right to shoot down unarmed, innocent civilians,&quot; Sharpton told an overflow crowd of several hundred people at his National Action Network office in the historically black Manhattan neighborhood. &quot;This city is going to deal with the blood of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>

Two of the three officers charged were also black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally at Sharpton's office was followed by a 20-block march down Malcolm X Boulevard and then across 125th Street, Harlem's main business thoroughfare, where some bystanders yelled out, &quot;Kill the police!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty of the marchers carried white placards bearing big black numbers for each of the police bullets fired at Bell and his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton urged people to return for a meeting this coming week &quot;to plan the day that we will close this city down&quot; with the kind of &quot;massive civil disobedience&quot; once led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</SPAN></P>

This city is going to deal with the blood of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally at Sharpton's office was followed by a 20-block march down Malcolm X Boulevard. Sharpton urged people to return for a meeting this week to plan the day that we will close this city down with the kind of massive civil disobedience once led by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They never accused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of doing anything. Then why is he dead? Sharpton asked, his voice roaring with anger. Authorities have shown now that they will not hold police accountable. Well, guess what? If you won't, we will!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shut it down! Shut it down! the crowd chanted, standing up and applauding wildly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton didn't say exactly how they would protest the acquittals of the officers who fired the 50 shots. He said Bell's supporters could demonstrate all over the city, from Wall Street to the home of Justice Arthur Cooperman, who on Friday acquitted the three detectives after a nonjury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting behind Sharpton as he spoke were Bell's parents, his sister and Nicole Paultre Bell, who took her fiance's name after his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justice system let me down, Paultre Bell told the crowd in a soft voice. April 25, 2008: They killed Sean all over again. That's what it felt like to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was her first public comment since she stormed out of a courtroom Friday after the NYPD detectives were cleared in Bell's killing as he left his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Bell's companions, Joseph Guzman, also spoke briefly on Saturday, saying: We've got a long fight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov. 25, 2006, should have been the happiest day of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> life. But instead of getting married on that date, he was killed in a hail of 50 bullets fired by a group of New York police officers. The unarmed Bell and his two friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, also unarmed, encountered the undercover cops in the parking lot of a Queens strip club. Bell and his friends had gone to the club to celebrate the 23-year-old black man's last hours of bachelorhood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a few frantic moments, the police officers had fired upon the young men whom they say they feared were armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, three officers, two of whom were black, were acquitted of all charges in the shooting that left Bell dead and Benefield and Guzman wounded. Michael Oliver, a Clifton native who'd fired 31 shots, and fellow officer Gescard Isnora had stood trial for manslaughter. A third officer, Marc Cooper, had been charged with reckless endangerment. Two other shooters were not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Oliver was the only white officer on trial, the history of black men being shot by the police in New York and across the country gave the case a disquieting racial cast, at least to some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the two-month, non-jury trial, the judge, Justice Arthur Cooperman, explained his verdict. He said the state had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the police officers - who did not testify in the trial - had previously offered more credible accounts of the early-morning encounter than the two men who survived the torrent of bullets did. The police officers' account of the encounter had been culled from grand jury testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the judge's verdict is just the beginning. A long retrial of the troubling events began Friday outside a Queens courthouse, where some in the crowd shouted, &quot;Murderers!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of public opinion about the verdict will be largely guided by what people are predisposed to believe: what their experiences with the police and young black and brown men have been, and how they feel about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people don't like to talk about the chasms that separate many segments of our society until blood seeps across the divide: Somebody dies. Someone else goes on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is dead. Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper have been acquitted of the charges against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you think about that? What are you predisposed to believe?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five days before the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial began, Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, under pressure to talk about what everyone knew would be a fraught and contentious case, told reporters, ''The case should be tried in the courtroom and not on the courthouse steps.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, of course, it has been. And it did not turn out well for Mr. Brown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three detectives accused of killing Mr. Bell in a spray of 50 bullets after his bachelor party on Nov. 25, 2006, were acquitted on all counts at the seven-week trial in State Supreme Court in Queens. Moreover, the judge who issued the verdict, Arthur J. Cooperman, criticized the prosecution's presentation, saying that several inconsistencies had the effect of ''eviscerating the credibility'' of certain state witnesses. The judge added that the testimony of those witnesses ''just didn't make sense.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown, 75, who has been the district attorney in Queens for nearly 17 years, is  a former judge who has been around the New York law enforcement world so long that in 1977 he presided over the arraignment of the ''Son of Sam'' serial killer, David Berkowitz. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, defense lawyers, former prosecutors and other interested observers have begun the inevitable process of dissecting his handling of the Bell case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The case was flawed from the beginning and probably shouldn't even have been brought to indictment,'' said Marvyn M. Kornberg, a defense lawyer with a longstanding practice in Queens. ''There was conflict in the testimony, not only internally with each witness, but externally, between the witnesses. Those are the kind of witnesses you put on the stand?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Monday-morning lawyering is, of course, a significantly painless task, and nothing about the Bell case was painless for those who were directly involved. After the shooting, outside the Club Kalua in Jamaica, the city felt the wrath of a storm of community outrage and racial anger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown was at its center, monitoring the Internet for updates at 5 a.m. on the day it occurred from his weekend house in Litchfield County, Connecticut. Days later, he met with the Rev. Al Sharpton and Mr. Bell's relatives to explain the investigative process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the indictments were announced, he appeared at a news conference to say that the investigation had drawn on 100 witnesses and 500 pieces of evidence and that the grand jury proceedings were ''as thorough and complete as I've ever participated in.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think he presented the case he could present,'' said Joseph G. Sulik, another Queens defense lawyer, who watched parts of the trial. ''He has to put the people who were there on the stand -- you have to take them, good or bad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, clearly, they were both. Several witnesses, including some of Mr. Bell's childhood friends, provided testimony that seemed to better serve the three detectives charged in his killing: Gescard F. Isnora, Marc Cooper and Michael Oliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much of that testimony involved the central defense question of whether there was an armed man present when the police opened fire. Accounts differed about an argument that Mr. Bell had outside the club with a man dressed in black, later identified as Fabio Coicou. Detective Isnora had said that he followed a member of Mr. Bell's party, Joseph Guzman, from the club because he thought Mr. Guzman was going to retrieve a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of Mr. Bell's friends who witnessed the argument from several feet away, Hugh Jensen, testified that the exchange between Mr. Bell and Mr. Coicou was benign. But he said on cross-examination that he believed Mr. Coicou was armed. Another friend, Larenzo Kinred, told investigators that he believed the man was armed or pretending to be armed. And Mr. Coicou contradicted his own grand jury testimony while testifying, recanting a prior statement that he had heard one of Mr. Bell's friends say he was going to get a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A former federal prosecutor, Alan Vinegrad, who tried the Abner Louima police brutality case, after Mr. Louima was tortured with a broken broomstick in a Brooklyn station house in 1997, said that Mr. Brown's office had a very difficult job in the Bell case. At the same time, he wondered why so many state witnesses -- there were 50 -- were called to the stand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The prosecution called numerous witnesses to testify about a relatively short sequence of events,'' Mr. Vinegrad said. ''And doing that created the kind of inconsistency that is basically reasonable doubt.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Joseph Tacopina, another former prosecutor and a defense lawyer who represented one of the officers in the Louima case, said that Mr. Brown had no choice but to approach the case with the witnesses he had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are facts beyond change, and the best prosecutor in the world can't do anything about that,'' he said. ''You're only as good as the witnesses you're given.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is never comfortable for a district attorney's office, which relies upon the police to investigate crimes, to prosecute officers. Some lawyers, like Mr. Tacopina, said it was an open question that Mr. Brown might have sought an indictment in the case to quell the political winds and racial tensions that were rising soon after the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kornberg, the defense lawyer, went one step further, suggesting that by taking the case to trial Mr. Brown had forced Justice Cooperman to assume the burden of decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It took the political pressure off Brown, didn't it?'' Mr. Kornberg said. ''He could say, 'Now the court has spoken. I did what I had to do. I presented everything to the judge, and he found against me.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement after the verdict, Mr. Brown ran down a list of statistics from the trial: 28 days, 60 witnesses, 900 exhibits, a transcript that ran 5,400 pages. While he made no mention of the strategy his office had pursued at trial, he said it was essential to continue the ''public debate'' that the case had brought about ''through passionate and reasoned argument.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview in December 2006, only days after the shooting, Mr. Brown was asked whether the case might turn out to be a career-breaker rather than a career-maker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His answer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What you're suggesting is, 'You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't,' '' he said. ''But I'm not here because it's a cushy job. I'm here because I want to do the right thing.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was anger on the streets of Jamaica, Queens, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed in a hail of 50 police bullets in 2006 -- both before and after a judge on Friday acquitted three detectives who had been charged in the shooting. But many black men and women in Jamaica and elsewhere in New York said their anger was tempered by the complicated case that unfolded in a city less racially divided than 10 years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Harlem, Willie Rainey, 60, a Vietnam veteran and retired airport worker, said that he believed the detectives should have been found guilty, but that he saw the case through a prism not of race, but of police conduct. ''It's a lack of police training,'' Mr. Rainey said. ''It's not about race when you have black killing black. We overplay the black card as an issue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even near Liverpool Street and 94th Avenue in Jamaica, the very spot where Mr. Bell was killed, Kenneth Outlaw stood and spoke not only of the humanity of Mr. Bell but of the police as well. ''A cop is a human being just like anyone else,'' said Mr. Outlaw, 52. ''If I had to be out here, facing the same dangers the cops face, I'd be scared to death too.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York controversies have a way of playing out along racial lines in a city that is diverse but often seems stratified. When Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, was killed by the police in a blast of 41 shots in the doorway of a Bronx apartment building in 1999, his death became shorthand for excessive police force against minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet in the aftermath of the verdict in the Bell case, many black New Yorkers reacted not with outrage but with a muted reserve, saying that the city felt like a less polarized place in 2008, nearly a decade after the Diallo shooting and with a different mayor and police commissioner. Some also said that after a seven-week trial, the picture of what happened the night Mr. Bell, a black man, was killed was still murky, and so they left the public outcry to a relatively small group of black activists who had been closely monitoring the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were those, however, who spoke of losing faith and trust in both law enforcement and the judicial system, and who saw the Bell case as a vivid example of how little has changed. ''How many shots have to be fired for things to change?'' asked Torell Marsalis, 35, of South Jamaica. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The verdict set off visible outrage. There were scuffles outside the Queens Criminal Court building, a few marches and rallies in Queens on Friday night, and later, angry denunciations among some black activists, including the Rev. Al Sharpton. But elsewhere, the reaction was more nuanced, even subdued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the dozens of black men and women interviewed in recent days, many said they sympathized with Mr. Bell's family, but also with police officers who must make life-and-death decisions in tense, uncertain moments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ayana Fobbs, 27, a pharmacy worker who lives in Jamaica, a few blocks from the Community Church of Christ, where Mr. Bell's funeral was held, said she could identify with people on both sides of the Bell shooting. One of her cousins was killed by the police in a shooting in the Bronx in the early 1990s, she said, but she also had close friends who were police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm just concerned about what kind of message it's going to send on both sides,'' Ms. Fobbs said on Saturday. ''The community here is going to feel like anybody is fair game, if something like this could happen to an unarmed man and nobody was held accountable. And then, with the officers, it sends a message to them that they can do these types of things and get away with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others said that had they been on a jury during the trial, they would have found the officers not guilty based on what they felt was the flawed case prosecutors put forward. Still others said that they did not know what to think, after weeks of following contradictory testimony in the news. ''If I was the judge, I wouldn't know what to do,'' Paul Randall, 22, a college student, said on Thursday. ''From following the case, it's kind of hard to say one way or the other.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of this uncertainty and ambivalence was on display on Liverpool Street immediately after Justice Arthur J. Cooperman found the three detectives not guilty of all the charges against them. One hour after the verdict, no crowd had gathered at the tattered memorial to Mr. Bell. Someone had placed a blue votive candle on the sidewalk, and there was one old, brittle bouquet of flowers and one fresh one. The water-cooler jug someone had placed there for donations contained just a few bills. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A man who approached was not there to protest the verdict. He was only walking by, on his way to pay a parking ticket around the corner. The man, Elliott Clark, 54, had seen the news of the judge's decision on television, and though he disagreed with the verdict, he was more resigned than outraged. This was not 2000, when Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor and Howard Safir was police commissioner and the four officers indicted in the killing of Mr. Diallo were acquitted, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The times have changed,'' said Mr. Clark, a case manager for H.I.V. and AIDS patients who lives nearby in St. Albans. ''People have been so disappointed by the outcome of the judicial system. Every five years something crazy happens, and people are people. They move on with their lives.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Diallo was unarmed when he was shot while reaching for his wallet. The officers who shot him were all white. In the Bell case, two of the detectives who were on trial are black, including the one who fired first. The third, Michael Oliver, the one who fired the most shots -- 31 -- is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And this time it was Detective Oliver -- who fired 16 rounds and then reloaded -- who bore the brunt of the criticisms of those interviewed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That was his time to be a cowboy,'' said David Jones, 49, a limousine driver who was walking by the memorial on Thursday with his fiancee, Nicole Hodges. ''I think it's repulsive. It's demeaning to African-Americans and their community.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Mr. Jones and other young and middle-aged black men, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become a symbol of what they describe as police aggression and racial profiling in black neighborhoods. Had Mr. Bell and his friends been white, they said, the police would have responded less aggressively, and Mr. Bell might still be alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My mother always has to look outside her window and worry about us because of the cops,'' said Ray Powell, 23, a Queensborough Community College student who was at the memorial on Friday. ''If it was me, if I shot a gun 30 times, I would get the death penalty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And even those who noted that two of the officers involved in the Bell shooting were black said their race was less important than their badges. ''Some would argue that these were not black cops,'' said Kaleem Musa Keita, 49, who was outside the courthouse in Queens when the verdict was announced. ''They're black in color, but they didn't represent their community. They were representing the police.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even as some condemned the behavior of the police, other black men and women interviewed praised Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's got people who are at least willing to communicate with the black community,'' said Salaam Ismail, 50, a youth coordinator, standing outside the Harlem headquarters of Mr. Sharpton's National Action Network on Friday. ''The mayor has done a lot of pre-emptive strikes with that kind of stuff, meeting with community leaders.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Nov. 27, 2006, two days after Mr. Bell was killed, the mayor convened a private meeting of black religious leaders and elected officials at City Hall. One of those at the meeting was the city's police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, who a month after the shooting set up a panel to review the rules and tactics of undercover operations in response to the Bell case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saturday morning, Norma Wait was inside the Arising Barber Shop in Jamaica, talking about the change over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I must give it to the younger generation,'' said Ms. Wait, 62, a bank worker originally from Belize who lives in South Jamaica. ''They got a more level head. They know you don't get justice by breaking windows and burning and looting. You get justice by presenting yourself, demonstrating, calling on the politicians.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dorothy Omega, 70, a retired drug counselor, sat in the audience at Mr. Sharpton's headquarters, waiting for him to speak about the verdict. Even there, in the Harlem building known as the House of Justice, Ms. Omega sought the middle ground. She said she understood the anger expressed by Mr. Sharpton, but at the same time, she said, ''The Police Department needs our support, too.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE first time I almost shot someone, I wasn't that scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was 1986, and my partner and I had responded to a report of a man waving a knife inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal. When we arrived, I saw the knife in the man's outstretched arm. I drew my weapon, and I yelled at him to drop the knife. My partner began inching his way toward the man, pleading with him to put the knife down. I made up my mind that I was going to shoot if the man lunged toward us. My partner got close enough to swing his nightstick down on the man's arm. The knife fell to the ground and we quickly handcuffed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why wasn't I scared? Because I could see the threat clearly; I knew what I was facing. There were plenty of other times during my 20-year police career, however, when I was afraid. Usually it was when I couldn't clearly see a potential suspect and didn't know if he had a weapon. For a police officer, if a suspect is ignoring your commands and you can't see his hands, you will feel that your life is in danger.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was the situation that faced the police detectives who shot and killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> outside the Club Kalua in Queens on Nov. 25, 2006. So I'm glad that on Friday, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman was able to navigate through the rhetoric of the prosecution and acquit Detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper on manslaughter and all other charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell was killed and two of his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were seriously wounded in a fusillade of 50 bullets. The police, who were conducting a prostitution sting, said that Mr. Bell tried to drive over an undercover detective. The officers fired because they thought one of the Bell party had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since no gun was found in the vehicle, it is clear that the police officers made a tragic mistake. They even violated department guidelines, which prohibit using deadly force against someone in a vehicle unless he is threatening an officer's life by means other than the vehicle, such as firing a gun at the same time. But in the end, what they did was not criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When police officers are cleared of charges in a tragedy like the Bell shooting, or that of Amadou Diallo in 1999, critics will look elsewhere to assign blame. A common claim is that if the officers aren't to blame, the fault must lie in their training. This is nonsense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the time of the Diallo shooting, I was an instructor in the Police Department's in-service training unit. I trained more than 1,000 supervisors, using seminars and role-playing exercises in various subjects including deadly physical force. Trust me: training can instill good habits and safe tactics, but you can't control the level of fear, or the individual choice that a person makes about when to pull that trigger. In that position, an officer has seconds to make a life-altering decision: Is my life in imminent danger? How to answer that question can't be taught in a classroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That said, I do believe that the first officer to fire his weapon in the Bell case, Detective Isnora, carries a greater moral responsibility than the others. Once he fired, contagious shooting took hold, making it difficult for the others to stop. But this case was not about manslaughter or any other crime. It was about whether the judge believed Detective Isnora when he told the grand jury that he felt his life and the lives of his team members were at stake. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not many people will ever know what that feels like. Most police officers, myself included, never get shot or even discharge their guns.  No one can fairly say that the detectives outside the Kalua were not in a dangerous situation. Some New Yorkers seem to think it wasn't quite dangerous enough. Well, they can debate that for an eternity. Gescard Isnora wasn't afforded such leisure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For most people exonerated at trial, this story would be over -- but not for the police. The officers still face the prospect of federal charges and departmental punishment. It makes me very glad I didn't have to shoot that man in the Port Authority. Even though he had a knife, the police are always second-guessed when they use deadly physical force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his closing arguments last week, the prosecutor, Charles Testagrossa, said, ''We ask the police to risk their lives to protect ours.'' I agree. But they shouldn't have to gamble with them. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A  SCORE of teenagers from Bedford-Stuyvesant were slumped in their swivel chairs Wednesday night when Noel Leader, a retired police sergeant. and Keith Sainten, a police detective who was off duty, asked for volunteers. A few eagerly raised their hands.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This'll be a hostile car stop,'' Mr. Sainten said, instructing two of the boys to imagine they were sitting in a flashy Escalade that had just been pulled over to the curb. ''What I want you to do is give them lip. You're not going to flail your hands. You're just going to be angry because you're tired of getting stopped.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Leader selected two other volunteers to portray police officers. He placed dark blue police caps atop their cornrow braids and do-rags, dressed them in blue mesh police vests and handed them toy cap guns. They were dispatched to the pretend window of the pretend vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''License and registration, please,'' one of the mock police officers said in his best television-inspired police imitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The faux passengers responded by shouting and howling insults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He didn't run no red light, son!'' one of them hollered. ''It was yellow!'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another chimed in: ''Yo, my mom's on the phone! She want to speak with you right now!'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The room erupted in giggles, but the exercise, part of a workshop for young people on how to behave when stopped by the police, had its serious side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sponsoring organization, 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, has often been critical of the Police Department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the timing could not have been more appropriate. A verdict in the trial of three detectives charged in the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was due in two days; on Friday, they would be found not guilty on all felony and misdemeanor charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Part of the workshop's underlying message was how to behave in situations like the one Mr. Bell faced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The way we look at it, anyone here can be the next </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when we leave here tonight, or next week,'' said Mr. Sainten, one of about 15 law enforcement officers who lead the free workshops, which have been presented hundreds of times since 1995. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The workshops stemmed in part from the recognition that encounters between officers and young blacks and Latinos do not always follow the police handbook. In those situations, Mr. Leader and Mr. Sainten urged, the young people should display respect and deference, to avoid possible problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The teenagers participating in the workshop that evening were members of a Brooklyn youth group called Project Re-Generation. Nearly all of them said they had either been stopped by the police when they had not committed a crime or knew people who had been stopped in such circumstances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That's normal for Bed-Stuy,'' said Diane Glasgow, a 16-year-old wearing braces and shiny lip gloss. ''You just let it happen.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Joseph Guzman, who was shot more than a dozen times while sitting next to Mr. Bell, followed her to the microphone and spoke in somber tones of the emotional whiplash of the previous 24 hours.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Paultre Bell and Mr. Guzman spoke publicly on Saturday for the first time since a judge on Friday acquitted three detectives charged in the shooting of Mr. Bell in November 2006 outside a strip club in Jamaica, Queens, where he had celebrated his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They were among more than 100 people -- including Mr. Bell's parents, William and Valerie Bell -- who packed into the Harlem headquarters of the National Action Network, the organization founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, to denounce the verdict and the judge who handed it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''April 25, 2008, they killed Sean all over again,'' Ms. Paultre Bell told the audience. ''I'm still praying for justice, because this is far from over. Every march, every protest, every rally, I'm going to be right up front.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman wore a long chain with a diamond-studded ''S'' hanging from it, a tribute to Mr. Bell. ''Yesterday, I felt defeated,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trent Benefield, who was in the back seat of Mr. Bell's car and was also shot by the police, was not at the meeting because he remained distraught about the verdict, said Michael Hardy, Mr. Benefield's lawyer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, Mr. Sharpton pledged to lead boycotts, protests and acts of civil disobedience. But except for a small march in Harlem on Saturday morning -- which Mr. Sharpton did not participate in -- there was no visible reaction in the city to the verdict. Extra security was seen outside the Police Department headquarters. Police vehicles were parked outside the Queens home of the judge who presided over the Bell trial, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman, and a police helicopter flew overhead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton said he planned to meet on Monday with Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors say they are investigating the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton also said he would meet on Tuesday night with community leaders in Manhattan to plan demonstrations that he said would begin within a week. As he did on Friday, Mr. Sharpton attacked several parts of Justice Cooperman's statement explaining his verdict. The judge said that prosecutors failed to prove their case and that the wounded friends of Mr. Bell gave testimony that he did not believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Harlem, the relatively small protest started around 11:30 a.m., when a group of more than 100 people marched south on Lenox Avenue from 145th Street. They carried signs with the numerals 1 through 50 written on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inside Mr. Sharpton's headquarters, those closest to Mr. Bell spoke of their own readiness to march. ''We still here, we still in it,'' said Mr. Guzman, who spoke so softly at one point that the audience had to ask him to speak into the microphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman showed little of what the lawyers for the detectives -- and even Justice Cooperman -- suggested was a bellicose demeanor on the witness stand. There were moments when his face turned red, seemingly overcome with emotion. He said he sometimes heard Mr. Bell's voice when he was in his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  William Bell showed the most frustration. At one point, while everyone stood and chanted, he sat stiff-jawed in his seat, his elbows on his knees and his fingers interlocking. Later, he stepped to the microphone and said, ''Is this 1955 Alabama?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Valerie Bell spoke of her faith in God and her lingering anguish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''On May 18, 1983, I didn't go through labor pains with my son because he was born C-section,'' she said. ''But on Nov. 25, 2006, that's when my labor pains started.'' That was the day Mr. Bell was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Paultre Bell, who took Mr. Bell's name after his death, chose not to make any denunciations after the shooting, deferring to the legal system, said Mr. Hardy, who is representing her, Mr. Benefield and Mr. Guzman in a $50 million lawsuit against the city. That respect had evaporated, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think Cooperman's rejection, his unequivocal rejection, was liberating to Nicole,'' Mr. Hardy said. ''She now feels unrestrained in her love for Sean and her quest for justice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, on Saturday, Ms. Paultre Bell said, ''The justice system let me down.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At one point during his 30-minute speech, Mr. Sharpton's voice rumbled to a scratchy crescendo as he spoke of his childhood in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and how his mother fought to keep him out of trouble and make sure he got an education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then, with tears streaming down his face, he pointed to Valerie Bell and Ms. Paultre Bell and said: ''I'm going to help these two women fight for that little boy. That little boy didn't deserve to die, and this city is going to deal with the blood of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ARGENTINA'S FARMERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Revolt Over Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Argentina's government decided to impose higher taxes on farm profits in March, it set off a rural revolt, with enraged farmers blocking roads around the country for three weeks. Since then, the government has been trying to quell fears at the negotiating table, but some farmers say the talks are yet more proof that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner does not understand them.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A SNUB FOR ZIMBABWE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Angola announced that a Chinese ship bearing arms for its longtime ally Zimbabwe would not be allowed to unload them while docked in Angola. It was the latest and most surprising evidence of success in the international pressure campaign against the Zimbabwean government.  PAGE 12 </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NEED A BICYCLE?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here. Take One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bicycle-centric cultures of Europe have long made getting about on two wheels more simple than it is in most American cities. But, under a new public-private program in the nation's capital, people will soon be able to borrow a bicycle anytime they need one.   PAGE 23</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE TOXIN-EATING FUNGUS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the residents of Fort Bragg, Calif., faced the need to clean up the dioxin that pollutes the site of a former lumber mill or risk losing a $4.2 million grant for a coastal trail, they considered the options. Among them: mushrooms.   PAGE 26</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Wake of Bell Verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict may have dampened the spirits and responses of some family and friends, one burned high and hot. Nicole Paultre Bell, the woman to marry Mr. Bell before his death and previously gentle in demeanor, vowed to hold the city accountable, saying the the justice system had ''let her down.''  Page 35</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OUT OF THE POOL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the regulars at the adult morning swim program at the Boys and Girls Clubs of Northern Westchester, there was more to it than just exercise. There was family, in the broad sense. Connections. Caring. And so when the club decided to cancel the program, citing cost, an uproar followed. Our Towns, by Peter Applebome.   PAGE 31</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE BATTLE FOR COPIERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most legislative bodies confer some special privileges on the majority party, but few can top New York's Legislature for extremes. So for Democrats hoping to take control of the State Senate this November for the first time in decades, there's even more at stake than just controlling legislation. Like getting new office supplies.  PAGE 31</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SUNDAY BUSINESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WASN'T ANYBODY MINDING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Wall Street Store?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In case you have been wondering how the credit crisis on Wall Street became such a mess -- wondering about fail-safe devices, government watchdogs, ratings agencies and the like -- you may well want to read a speech on the whole thing given by an investor named David Einhorn. Or at least the CliffsNotes version.   PAGE 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  HOME-BREWED CAR FUEL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A fellow in California has teamed with a Silicon Valley entrepreneur to create a home ethanol system that will be about as large as a stackable washer-dryer, sell for $9,995, and produce fuel for cars at a cost of, say, $1 a gallon. Sound good? Well, ''skepticism is a virtue,'' one expert says.   PAGE 5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WARMING TO THE VILLAIN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The evil businessman has been a reliable film villain since even before people in movies talked. (Pick your favorite: Mr. Potter? Gordon Gekko? Other?) But some coming releases suggest that moviemakers might be rethinking the archetype, if only slightly.   PAGE 7</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Four Off-Years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was a time when Jeff Burton was considered a champion in waiting on the Nascar circuit, especially after he finished third in Cup point standings in 2000. Then came less impressive finishes and a flame-out with Roush Racing four years ago. But he has regained some status this season.    PAGE 8</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PLAYOFF CHANCES DWINDLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lopsided matchups and sluggish TV ratings for college football's Bowl Championship Series this year gave rise to talk about potential change in the postseason structure. But with the annual B.C.S. meetings starting Sunday, optimism has turned to pessimism, and talk of change appears to be just that.  PAGE 6</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OUT OF THE CLOSET</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Toward the Altar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why would gay men in their 20s rush to marry? Maybe it has something to do with gay teenagers' coming out earlier and being able to experience a gay adolescence, Benoit Denizet-Lewis writes. And with all that out of the way, he adds, they just want what they've seen espoused by the mainstream.  PAGE 28</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OBITUARIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CAMERON ARGETSINGER, 87</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His love of speed cultivated on country roads led him to help revive road racing in postwar America and establish Watkins Glen, N.Y., as a stop on the Formula One circuit.  PAGE 29</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A NEW CHALLENGE </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Some Marriages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a situation not specifically anticipated in the traditional better-worse, richer-poorer marital vows: What if one member of the original pair has a sex-change operation? The law, as you might expect, is not exactly prepared for that either, as some anxious couples are finding out.   PAGE 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NARROWCASTING FOR MATES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's say you're an Ayn Rand fan. A really, really big fan: Her writing inspired you to turn from devout Christianity to atheism. You want a partner who shares your outlook on life, but how to find one? Look online, of course, among the growing number of niche dating sites.  PAGE 9</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saw Through His Lens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ansel Adams first visited Yosemite National Park when he was 14, and he accidentally snapped a topsy-turvy photograph that became one of his lifelong favorites. Today, professional and novice photographers still go to Yosemite, trying to retrace his path -- and, perhaps, capture a bit of his magic.   PAGE 3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A MIXED BLESSING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Its grand Buddhist temples and tucked-away shrines, its mountains and trickling canals, its spring-blossoming cherry trees and autumn-flaming maples, make Kyoto perhaps Japan's prettiest city. So of course it's packed with tourists. And expensive -- is it possible to find tranquillity on a budget?  PAGE 7</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legend has it that the disturbances that convulsed France in the spring of 1968 began at the movies and came full circle when, three months later, the Cannes Film Festival was halted. New Yorkers can mark the 40th anniversary of that year with a program on Jean-Luc Godard at the Film Forum and a wide-ranging series at Lincoln Center. A review by A. O. Scott.  PAGE 1 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MADONNA, BACK TO ROOTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Madonna's 11th studio album, ''Hard Candy,'' is devoted to the instant gratification of a musical sweet tooth, Jon Pareles writes,  the kind of collection a record company craves in the current embattled market: a set of catchy, easily digestible, mass-appeal songs by a star who's not taking chances.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BEHIND THE COVERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ''I want my MTV'' campaign made him one of the most influential admen of his generation. But among admirers of brilliant design, George Lois is most esteemed for the covers he created for Esquire, 31 of which are in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.   PAGE 1 </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much of New York City is indoors, to adapt a line from the humorist Dave Barry, so it might stand to reason that outdoor spaces like terraces and balconies would be at a premium, especially at this time of year. But not everybody finds them worth the trouble.   PAGE 1</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MARTIN AMIS,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Catastrophist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In ''The Second Plane,'' his collection of essays about Sept. 11, Martin Amis substitutes insult for analysis and writes about history and politics as if Orwell had never lived, Leon Wieseltier writes. For all of Mr. Amis's testimonies about the event's transformative impact, there is at least one way in which he has been thoroughly untouched by the atrocity: he is still busy with the pursuit of extraordinary sentences.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Motors has installed an innovative hybrid system in a couple of its larger sport utilities and plans to add the system to other models. In addition to considering the higher costs, prospective buyers might want to reflect on whether the car-based crossovers that are inherently more efficient might be a better choice.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Presidential Hopes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The campaign season has been filled with references to the historic possibilities posed by the remaining two Democratic candidates for president. But Senator John McCain has a historic role of his own to play: He is the latest -- and almost certainly the last -- hope for Americans born in the 1930s to send one of their own to the White House.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TESTING DEMOCRATIC UNITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats promise that despite the rancor of this primary season, all will be forgiven in the end and the party will rally around the nominee. They cite past experience  as proof. But will the polarization exposed this year be so deep that it cannot be bridged?   PAGE 4</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY now, with all the talk of outrage over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict, you would think the jails would be filled with protesters, traffic would be tied up in every direction and the judge who acquitted the defendant shooters would at least be hanged in effigy.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the sun rose over a peaceful city yesterday, a day after deep disappointment for many, New York was no more on edge than it was when the Giants won the Super Bowl.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders promised peace - and delivered. But even that wasn't necessary to curtail an explosion. There was never any powder in the keg.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A riot, like the one that hit Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, needs a little time to build. Tensions simply don't exist the way they did when Rudy Giuliani was mayor.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no surprise - not even to Bell's most ardent supporters - that Judge Arthur Cooperman would acquit the cops who killed Bell on Nov. 25, 2006, when they fired 50 shots at Bell's car.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most cynics - that is, most of the black community - knew what the verdict would be before the first witness was called.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the expectations been higher, the outrage would have certainly been greater, although most of us are grateful that the city is not engulfed in flames.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we expected nothing, and got even less.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, an adviser to Bell's family and friends, vowed yesterday to &quot;shut the city down&quot; in protest, but he didn't say when.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's like striking while the iron is cooling off and being placed on a shelf in the closet.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curtis Franklin, 26, said the shirt has been selling online to customers from as far away as Maryland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As young black people, we feel the same pain,&quot; said Franklin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he never met Bell, but they had mutual friends. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those friends asked Franklin to create a shirt honoring the late father of two, who died in a fusillade of bullets just hours before he was to be married. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franklin was happy to lend a creative hand, especially since the friend who approached him was supposed to have attended the fateful bachelor party in which Bell and two of his pals were shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could have been any one of us in a situation like that anytime,&quot; said Rensford Montrose, who co-owns the design firm Eflat with Franklin. &quot;We're black. It could've happened to us.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shirts, worn by many Bell supporters and shooting victim Trent Benefield at Friday's verdict, are for sale on their Web site, fashionhurtz.com for $25. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the rally, about 100 Bell supporters flooded the streets and marched through Harlem chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; stopping briefly outside the 32nd Precinct station house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no arrests, and the same march is planned today.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the National Action Network rally, Sharpton urged people to protest Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman's verdict in nonviolent ways, and announced he was meeting with labor and community leaders Tuesday to discuss a day of civil disobedience to take place in the next two weeks. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- Hundreds of angry people marched through Harlem yesterday after the Rev. Al Sharpton promised to &quot;close this city down&quot; to protest the acquittals of three police detectives in the 50-shot barrage that killed a groom on his wedding day and wounded two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strategically know how to stop the city so people stand still and realize that you do not have the right to shoot down unarmed, innocent civilians,&quot; Mr. Sharpton told an overflow crowd of several hundred people at his National Action Network office in the historically black Manhattan neighborhood. &quot;This city is going to deal with the blood of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton was joined by the family of 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- a black man -- and a friend of Mr. Bell who was wounded in the 2006 shooting outside a Queens strip club. Two of the three officers charged were also black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton didn't say exactly how they would protest the acquittals of the officers who fired the 50 shots. He said Mr. Bell's supporters could demonstrate all over the city, from Wall Street to the home of Justice Arthur Cooperman, who on Friday acquitted the three detectives after a nonjury trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NORWICH, Conn. -- A fast-moving fire destroyed a large apartment complex early yesterday, and authorities were looking for one person unaccounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities have confirmed the locations of all but one of the nearly 150 residents, said Fire Battalion Chief Tracy Montoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wreckage was still too hot by late morning to allow the use of arson dogs or cadaver dogs, Fire Chief Ken Scandariato said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause of the fire remained unclear, but officials were treating the blaze as suspicious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO -- Skid marks, a boarded-up entrance and police tape reminded commuters yesterday of the destruction left by a tractor-trailer that smashed into a crowded train station and killed two pedestrians, as authorities reviewed surveillance footage of the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 51-year-old truck driver was hospitalized after his truck careered off an expressway exit south of downtown and through a bus shelter under the elevated train tracks during evening rush hour. The driver, whose blood-alcohol test was negative, was released from the hospital Friday night but led away in handcuffs for questioning by Chicago police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had not been charged with any crime as of yesterday, police said, and they would not say whether he was still being questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shark-attack aftermath</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOLANA BEACH, Calif. -- A few paddleboarders ignored posted signs warning that a great white shark still could be lurking below the surface yesterday, just a day after a swimmer was killed in a rare attack near San Diego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the summer-like temperatures and cloudless skies that normally lure large crowds, beaches were mostly empty near where triathlete David Martin was killed Friday. Solana Beach is 14 miles northwest of San Diego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shark, presumed to be a great white, lifted Mr. Martin, 66, out of the water with his legs in its jaws, leaving deep lacerations and shredding the retired veterinarian's black wetsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, about eight miles of shoreline from San Diego north to Carlsbad remained under advisory closure as sheriff's helicopters scanned the shore for signs of the shark -- and for unwitting swimmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in the nation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pre-dawn water main break yesterday turned streets in Boston's financial district into rivers, forced the shutdown of a subway station and cut off natural gas service. ... An appeals court in California upheld a verdict finding actor Robert Blake liable for his wife's 2001 death but cut the $30 million jury award in half.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANGRY chants of ``KKK'' and ``murderers'' filled a New York courtroom yesterday as three detectives were acquitted of killing an unarmed black man in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the racially charged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case - which raised questions about whether police were trigger-happy and used excessive force - placed the city on high alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case brought back painful memories of other NYPD shootings, such as the 1999 death of Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant who was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets by officers who mistook his wallet for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of the officers in that case created a storm of protest, with hundreds arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed for calm in the wake of the latest decision, saying ``we don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city remained calm overnight with protests limited to scuffles outside Queens County Court when the verdict was delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, died in a hail of bullets outside the Kalua Cabaret strip club in Queens on November 25, 2006, after leaving his buck's party with two friends. Justice Arthur Cooperman found the officers not guilty, and suggested the prosecution witnesses had been unreliable. He found the shooting was careless but not reckless. ``The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant was not justified in firing,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cries of ``shame on you'' followed in the courtroom after the decision as a huge contingent of police tried to maintain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the three officers could still face internal disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department is reviewing the case to determine whether to pursue a federal civil rights prosecution against the officers. The Bell family is also considering an appeal and is suing the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, were put on trial for manslaughter and faced a maximum 25 years in jail. A third officer, Marc Cooper, 40, was charged with reckless endangerment. Detective Oliver, who fired 31 shots, said Justice Cooperman had made a ``fair and just decision''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court heard a team of detectives was at the club investigating reports of prostitution. Det Isnora said he heard one of Mr Bell's friends, Joseph Guzman, say he was going to get a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court was told, however, the men left the club, got into their car and, as they drove off, scraped an unmarked police van with Det Oliver at the wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers said they demanded the men stop and identified themselves as officers - a claim disputed by Mr Bell's friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives also said they fired after believing Det Isnora was being fired at from inside the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell died on the spot and two of his friends were wounded. No gun was found in their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton was incensed at the verdict and said ``the fight is far from over''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised protests ``to demonstrate to the federal government that New Yorkers will not take this abortion of justice lying down''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former presidential candidate the Rev Jesse Jackson said: ``This was a massacre and the Attorney-General must give an assurance that we all have equal protection under the law.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside court, Lorenzo Steele, a former police officer, said: ``We never shoot anyone 40 to 50 times. This was murder.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANGRY chants of ``KKK'' and ``murderers'' rang out in New York as three police detectives were acquitted of killing an unarmed black man in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the racially charged </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case -- which raised questions about whether the New York police were trigger-happy and used excessive force -- placed the city on high alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed for calm in the wake of the decision, saying ``we don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city remained calm, with protests limited to minor but angry scuffles outside the Queens County Court when the verdict was delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, a 23-year-old father of two, died in a hail of 50 bullets outside the seedy Kalua Cabaret strip club in Jamaica, Queens, on November 25, 2006, after leaving his bachelor party with friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three undercover detectives, who were at the club investigating reports of prostitution, claimed they believed one of the men was armed. No gun was ever found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman found the officers not guilty, and suggested the prosecution witnesses had been unreliable. He found the shooting was careless but not reckless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``At times, the testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant was not justified (in firing),'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cries of ``Shame on you'' filled the courthouse after the decision, while extra police converged on the courthouse to maintain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the three officers could still face internal disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But first, the US Justice Department is reviewing the case to determine whether to pursue a federal civil rights prosecution against the officers. The Bell family is also considering an appeal and is suing the city in a civil damages claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, were put on trial for manslaughter and faced a maximum 25 years in jail. A third officer Marc Cooper, 40, was charged with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Det Oliver, who fired 31 bullets the night of the shooting, said Justice Cooperman had made a ``fair and just decision''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights' activist the Reverend Al Sharpton described the verdict as ``one round down'' and vowed ``the fight is far from over''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He promised protests ``to demonstrate to the federal government that New Yorkers will not take this abortion of justice lying down''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We are going to be strategic. We are going to close the city down in a non-violent, effective way,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reverend Jesse Jackson said an ``ugly pattern is emerging in New York''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``This was a massacre. This was not a shoot-out and the US Attorney-General must give America the assurance that we all have equal protection under the law,'' he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three US detectives have been acquitted of all counts in the 50-shot killing of an unarmed man on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper from the New York City Police Department were charged with manslaughter, reckless endangerment and assault in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a Queens courtroom packed with spectators, including the victim's fiancee and parents. The ruling ended a two-month trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell was killed outside a strip club in Queens on November 25 2006 - his wedding day - as he was leaving his stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora and Oliver faced the most serious charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Not guilty!&quot; erupted outside the courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers, complaining pre-trial publicity unfairly painted them as cold-blooded killers, opted to have the judge decide the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Oliver, 36, and Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Cooper, 40, was charged with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other shooters weren't charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver squeezed off 31 shots; Isnora fired 11; and Cooper shot four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case brought back painful memories of other NYPD shootings, such as the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo - an African immigrant who was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets by police officers who mistook his wallet for a gun. The acquittal of the officers in that case created a storm of protest, with hundreds arrested after taking to the streets in demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood surrounding this case has been muted by comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Bell's fiancee, parents and their supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE New York police detectives were acquitted yesterday in a racially charged trial after an unarmed man died in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial, whose verdict prompted immediate anger within sections of New York's black community, has been one of the most controversial cases involving the city's police for years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, a black man, was killed outside a strip club in Queens in the early hours of Nov 25, 2006, as he was leaving his stag night party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They ran into undercover police, who had been staking out the club as part of a prostitution investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believing the men were about to shoot another man, the officers riddled their car with bullets, killing Mr Bell and wounding his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two defendants - Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29 - had been accused of manslaughter and faced 25 years in prison, while Marc Cooper, 40, was charged with reckless endangerment. Mr Oliver fired 31 shots and Mr Isnora 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman decided the case after the two defendants, who are black, said pre-trial publicity would prejudice any jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said many of the prosecution witnesses, including Mr Bell's friends and the two wounded men, were simply not credible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His verdict prompted several of Mr Bell's supporters to shout &quot;shame on you'' and storm out of the Queens courtroom, screaming their anger in the hall outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 200-strong crowd had gathered outside the building and there was brief jostling with police officers as the three defendants were led out of a courtroom side door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were cries of &quot;Murderers! Murderers!'' and &quot;KKK!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors had sought to show that the defendants had been inexperienced, frightened and disorganised, and had failed to warn their targets that they were police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence painted the victims as drunken thugs who the officers believed were armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the colour of two of the defendants made it difficult for critics to portray the shooting as racially motivated, the case revived the highly charged issue of the use of excessive force by New York police against black suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1999, Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant, was shot 41 times by four officers after they said they mistook his wallet for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds were arrested after taking to the streets to protest at the acquittal of the officers involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Rodney King, the black motorist beaten to death by Los Angeles policemen in 1991, the subsequent trial acquittals prompted rioting in the city, in which 53 people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cincinnati was plunged into three days of rioting in 2001 after a judge acquitted Stephen Roach, a white police officer, of killing Timothy Thomas, a 19-year-old black suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer claimed he had believed the victim was armed, although it was later revealed that Mr Thomas had been attempting to pull up his trousers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge in New York yesterday cleared three detectives on all charges involved in the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the bridegroom who died in a hail of 50 police bullets outside a nightclub hours before his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the crowded courtroom, where demonstrators carried signs reading &quot;50 shots isn't justice&quot;, there were shouts, tears and anger as the verdict was pronounced. Some protesters shouted &quot;murderers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict was met with quiet tears from Bell's mother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police blocked off the steps of the courthouse with metal barricades, and hustled the three detectives away through a side door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, had just left his stag party at a club in Jamaica, Queens, when he was shot and killed on November 25 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were also wounded as the three plainclothed police detectives opened fire on Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three of the men in the car were unarmed and the shooting - which recalled a 1999 episode in which an unarmed immigrant, Amadou Diallo, was shot dead by police - brought fierce criticism of the detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after a seven-week trial, Judge Arthur Cooperman ruled that the three police officers, Michael Oliver, 36, Gescard Isnora, 29, and Marc Cooper, 40, bore no criminal responsibility for the death of Bell or the wounding of his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and Isnora, who were charged with manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment, had faced a maximum of 25 years in prison. Cooper had faced a single charge of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three had elected to be tried before a judge, rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his verdict, the judge said that he simply did not believe the testimony of many of the prosecution's witnesses, including Bell's two wounded companions on that night. &quot;The testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's parents sat in silence as the judge gave his decision, but his fiancee, Nicole Paultre Bell, walked out. Other spectators erupted in disbelief. &quot;Did he just say, not guilty?&quot; one woman was reported as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the court, Leroy Gadsen, who had been monitoring the trial for the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, was outraged at the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't heard of any of these people having a gun or threatening anybody and yet we hear the verdict not guilty,&quot; he said. &quot;This case is not about justice. It is about the ability of the police to act above the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, who had been critical of the shooting, said that the judge had followed his duty to decide the case on evidence presented in his courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no winners in a trial like this,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;An innocent man lost his life, a bride lost her groom, two daughters lost their father, and a mother and a father lost their son. No verdict could ever end the grief of those who knew and loved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events of that November night began when Bell and his friends got into an argument outside the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party had no idea that the Club Kahlua was under police surveillance as part of an investigation into prostitution. Oliver, Isnora and Cooper had recently come on shift when the argument erupted. A number of witnesses testified that they heard talk of guns during the argument, and that Guzman had said: &quot;Yo, go get my gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives decided to follow Bell and his friends out to their car. They told the court they feared that talk of guns during the argument could lead to a shooting. According to Isnora, he then identified himself as a police detective, clipping his badge on his collar and shouting out: &quot;Police&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Guzman and Benefield said they heard no warning and had no idea that Isnora was with the police when he walked up to their car with his gun drawn. They say the gunfire erupted without any warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police, for their part, claimed that Guzman may have helped to provoke the shooting by urging Bell to drive away. The police claim that they opened fire only after Bell nudged Isnora with his car, pushing him into an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver then fired at Bell's car 31 times. Isnora fired 11 shots and Cooper four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victim and police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim was leaving a club in the early hours when he was killed. Two friends were wounded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective who fired 31 shots was found not guilty of manslaughter. He had faced 25 years in jail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gescard Isnora</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective said he shouted 'police' before shooting, but witnesses said they heard no warning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Cooper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective had faced a single charge of reckless endangerment. He fired four shots</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - The loudest sob in the courtroom may have been the one emitted by Michael Oliver, the New York police detective and Clifton native.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As state Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Cooperman read aloud the words &quot;not guilty&quot; Friday morning, thus ending an eight-week trial in the shooting death of 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oliver leaned forward, clutched his face and let out a choked sob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tears streaked the 36-year-old veteran cop's face as he stood and hugged his lead defense attorney, James Culleton. Oliver had faced up to 25 years in prison if convicted of first-degree manslaughter, the most serious of six criminal and misdemeanor charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His reaction was the most visceral of the three police detectives on trial, and it was in stark contrast to the stoic, if intense, calm he had presented since the November 2006 police shooting outside a Queens, N.Y., strip club, which ended the life of the unarmed Bell hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working as part of an undercover investigation of suspected prostitution at the Kalua Cabaret, Oliver infamously fired 31 of the 50 bullets at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nissan Altima after it hit his co-defendant, Detective Gescard Isnora, then twice struck an unmarked police van. An autopsy revealed it was one of Oliver's bullets that killed Bell, who lived in Jamaica, Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Isnora and a third co-defendant, Detective Marc Cooper, were also found not guilty by Cooperman on Friday. The judge heard the case without a jury at the defense team's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman explained his verdict as he delivered it. He said that while questions remain about the officers' competence and tactical training, he found the prosecution just did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers' actions were criminal. He said Isnora, who fired the first shot at Bell's car, had reason to believe that Bell's friend, Joseph Guzman, was reaching for a gun when Isnora attempted to stop the vehicle, which had just lightly struck his leg. The judge said the sometimes inconsistent, nonsensical and combative testimony of prosecution witnesses also harmed the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brief news conference Friday afternoon, the officers spoke for the first time about the case. Cooper apologized for Bell's death, although none of the four bullets he fired hit the man's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;I'd like to thank the Lord my savior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, acquittal does not mean the end of their legal troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's family, along with the two men injured in the police shooting, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, have filed a $50 million civil suit against New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Benton Campell said his office is reviewing the case and may file federal charges against Oliver and the other detectives, Isnora and Cooper, if evidence shows the officers violated Bell's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And after Friday's verdict, NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly, who declined to comment on the decision, hinted that the three officers involved in the shooting may face administrative charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promise of more litigation did little on Friday to allay the disappointment of Bell's family and the hundreds of supporters who packed the courtroom and clogged the sidewalks outside the Queens State Supreme Court complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many gasped at the verdict and sobbed at the crushing legal defeat it represented. William and Valerie Bell, the slain man's parents, clutched hands and remained seated in the third row. Nicole Paultre-Bell, who was to marry their son, fled the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bell's supporters left the courtroom, Oliver's family sat and expressed their relief. His mother, Yvonne, and sister, Geraldine, wept in the rear of the courtroom. Oliver's father, Norman, just stared into the distance and chewed gum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, they walked out of the court complex from a secluded entrance. Their expressions were serious and their voices grave as they said &quot;no comment&quot; to reporters when asked to talk about Oliver's acquittal. The three then stepped into a waiting black Ford sport utility vehicle and were driven north on Queens Boulevard, past the clamoring hordes of reporters and the outraged throngs of protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For about 40 minutes, the front of the court complex was chaotic. Helicopters hovered overhead. Activists picketed. Some carried banners that read, &quot;Justice for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... 50 More Reasons for a Revolution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen people marched in a circle chanting anti-police slogans: &quot;NYPD, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.&quot; Dozens of police officers, dressed in royal blue polo shirts, silently formed arm-to-arm chains to control the flows of human traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd turned as William and Valerie Bell, wearing sunglasses, led a long procession down the courthouse steps. William Bell, dressed in an ivory white suit and hat, briefly lifted his hand in a faint wave to the hundreds who had massed outside. The crowd followed the family and then mostly dispersed once they left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was 10 a.m. and back to business as usual at the courthouse. A line of people were allowed in to answer summonses and take care of other business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the anger did not disappear with the crowds. The Rev. Al Sharpton, a spokesman for Bell's family, called the ruling &quot;an abortion of justice.&quot; Others echoed the civil rights activist's sentiment and called out Cooperman by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The eyes of God are upon him, that wicked judge,&quot; said Fay E. Persaud, of Jamaica, Queens. &quot;The wrath of God is upon Cooperman. He did this because he is retiring and he doesn't give a damn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 74-year-old jurist is less than two years away from mandatory retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many said Cooperman's ruling was proof that the judicial system is stacked against black men when the police are the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know what's odd,&quot; said Will Reese, an activist from Harlem, &quot;is when the police get convicted of anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Clifton, members of Oliver's family remained inside his grandmother's home, near the city's border with Paterson. Several reporters from the New York tabloids camped out across the street, while Clifton police officers regularly patrolled the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver will not grant an interview about the Bell trial, according to a police union representative for the officer. And so far, his only words about the courtroom experience came during Friday's press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The picture of calm returned once again, as Oliver spoke briefly and thanked Cooperman for the not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT'S AHEAD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While three NYPD detectives were acquitted on Friday in state Supreme Court in Queens of all criminal charges in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in November 2006 and wounding his two friends, the officers and the city potentially face a long legal road ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$50 million lawsuit: Fianc&eacute;e Nicole Paultre-Bell, and the two men injured in the police shooting, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, have filed a $50 million civil rights and wrongful death lawsuits against New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal charges: Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell is reviewing the Bell case and may bring federal civil rights charges against NYPD detectives Michael Oliver of Clifton, Gescard Isnora, and Marc Cooper who were involved in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative action: New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly hinted Friday that the NYPD may bring disciplinary charges against the three officers involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge in New York yesterday cleared three detectives of all charges relating to the shooting of a young groom in November 2006, who died after he left a Queens strip club with friends, hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers fired 50 bullets, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and injuring two friends as they drove away from the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives were investigating alleged prostitution at the Kalua club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict triggered cries of protest in and outside the courtroom after a trial that has gripped the city's media for seven weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no justice in America,&quot; cried one man outside the courthouse after the verdict. Among those who walked out in protest were Mr Bell's parents and the civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants - detectives Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper - waived the right to a jury arguing that any panel would be biased against them because of the publicity surrounding the case. Charges against them included first- and second-degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Judge Arthur Cooperman said the prosecution had failed to prove that the officers had over-reached their authority in firing the shots. &quot;The testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three New York City police detectives were found not guilty Friday on all charges in the shooting death of a black man who died in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman, who delivered the verdict, said many of the prosecution's witnesses, including friends of the man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two wounded victims, were simply not believable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''At times, the testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His verdict prompted several supporters of Bell to storm out of the courtroom, and screams could be heard in the hallway moments later. The three detectives - Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper - were escorted out of a side door. Outside, a crowd gathered behind police barricades, occasionally shouting, amid a large number of police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict comes 17 months after the shooting Nov. 25, 2006, of Bell, 23, and his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, outside the Club Kalua in Queens, hours before Bell was to be married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was delivered in a packed courtroom and was heard by, among others, the slain man's parents and his fianc&eacute;e.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven-week trial, which ended April 14, was heard by Cooperman after the defendants waived their rights to a jury, a strategy some lawyers called risky at the time. But it paid off with the verdict Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before rendering his verdict, Cooperman ran through a narrative of the evening and concluded that ''the police response with respect to each defendant was not found to be criminal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt'' that each defendant was not justified in shooting, he said, before quickly saying the men were not guilty of all of the eight counts, five felonies and three misdemeanors, against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg said later: ''There are no winners in a trial like this. An innocent man lost his life, a bride lost her groom, two daughters lost their father, and a mother and a father lost their son.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg continued: ''Judge Cooperman's responsibility, however, was to decide the case based on the evidence presented in the courtroom. America is a nation of laws, and though not everyone will agree with the verdicts and opinions issued by the courts, we accept their authority.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">US: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A JUDGE in New York yesterday cleared three detectives on all charges involved in the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Se&aacute;n</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the bridegroom who died in a hail of 50 police bullets outside a nightclub hours before his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the crowded courtroom, where demonstrators carried signs reading &quot;50 shots isn't justice&quot;, there were shouts, tears and anger as the verdict was pronounced. Some protesters shouted &quot;murderers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict was met with quiet tears from Bell's mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police blocked off the steps of the courthouse with metal barricades, and hustled the three detectives away through a side door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell (23) had just left his stag party at a club in Jamaica, Queens, when he was shot and killed on November 25th, 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were also wounded as the three plainclothes police detectives opened fire on Mr Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three of the men in the car were unarmed, and the shooting - which recalled a 1999 episode in which an unarmed immigrant, Amadou Diallo, was shot dead by police - brought fierce criticism of the detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after a seven-week trial, Judge Arthur Cooperman ruled that the three police officers, Michael Oliver (36), Gescard Isnora (29) and Marc Cooper (40), bore no criminal responsibility for the death of Mr Bell or the wounding of his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Oliver and Mr Isnora, who were charged with manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment, had faced a maximum of 25 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cooper had faced a single charge of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three had elected to be tried before a judge, rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his verdict, the judge said that he simply did not believe the testimony of many of the prosecution's witnesses, including Mr Bell's two wounded companions on that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's parents sat in silence as the judge gave his decision, but his fiancee, Nicole Paultre Bell, walked out. Other spectators erupted in disbelief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did he just say, not guilty?&quot; one woman was reported as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the court, Leroy Gadsen, who had been monitoring the trial for the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, was outraged at the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't heard of any of these people having a gun or threatening anybody and yet we hear the verdict not guilty,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case is not about justice. It is about the ability of the police to act above the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, who had been critical of the shooting, said that the judge had followed his duty to decide the case on evidence presented in his courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no winners in a trial like this,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;An innocent man lost his life, a bride lost her groom, two daughters lost their father, and a mother and a father lost their son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No verdict could ever end the grief of those who knew and loved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Se&aacute;n</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Three New York police officers were acquitted Friday on all charges of gunning down an unarmed black man hours before his wedding, in a verdict that drew cries of shame from the courthouse gallery and muted victory cheers from officials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After weeks of hearing testimony, Justice Arthur Cooperman pronounced not-guilty verdicts against three police detectives who had opened fire in November 2006 on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, as he left a nightclub in the borough of Queens after celebrating his stag night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell died on the spot and two of his friends were wounded. An investigation showed that none of the victims was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the detectives, Gescard Isnora and Michael Oliver, faced up to 25 years in jail on charges of manslaughter while the third, detective Marc Cooper, faced one year in jail on the lesser charge of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cries of &quot;Shame on you&quot; rang out in the Queens courthouse, packed with spectators including Bell's fiancee and family, when the controversial verdicts were read out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver fired 31 shots in the incident, Isnora fired 11, and Cooper fired four times, according to testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper apologized to Bell's family following the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; an emotional Cooper. He then gave thanks for his acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to thank the Lord, my savior, for today. This has started my life back,&quot; said Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same news conference, the head of the New York City Detectives Endowment Association, the union representing the officers, hailed the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I stood at this microphone many months ago and said that this union would not blink; we would mount a vigorous defense for these detectives and we did that,&quot; union chief Michael Palladino said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colors rippled along Queens Boulevard in a declarative statement. Clad in royal blue polo shirts and pullovers, men and women stood in ranks five or six feet apart, their public identity instantly apparent from the gold-stitched lettering, ''NYPD Community Affairs,'' that blazed across their chests and backs. On their heads they wore navy blue baseball caps with big white letters that said ''NYPD.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was two minutes before 9 on Friday morning, and 98 police officers stretched in unmistakable presence along the sidewalk outside the Queens courthouse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They formed a human flag, flying the colors of the New York Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Within minutes, the matter of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- shot to death by police officers who tried to stop his car about 4:15 one morning while they were dressed as patrons of a topless bar and flying almost no flags of their real identity -- would return to the Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inside the courthouse, a judge ruled that the three officers charged in the shooting of Mr. Bell were not guilty, but said noncriminal ''carelessness and incompetence'' were not standards in his decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trial provided some answers on why the police officers fired: They mistakenly believed there was a gun in Mr. Bell's car. But the case did not explain how anyone could have expected him to know that he was being approached by a police officer at 4 a.m., and indeed, the judge, Arthur F. Cooperman, said that did not matter under the law. ''It was necessary to consider the mindset of each defendant at the time and place of occurrence,'' the judge said, ''and not the mindset of the victims.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, barring action by federal prosecutors, the next person to sit in judgment on what was done to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his two passengers will be the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. He must resolve questions that are politically charged for himself, his department and the public at large: whether the individual officers should be allowed to return to duty, and more broadly, if the case exposed shoddy practices in some undercover operations that put members of the public at risk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said that Friday's verdict should not be taken as an acquittal of serious management weaknesses that he believes led to the Bell shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''To the contrary,'' Mr. Brown said, the trial ''revealed significant deficiencies in, among other things, supervision, tactical planning, communications and management accountability -- insufficiencies that need to be addressed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He noted that a special panel set up by the Police Department after the shooting of Mr. Bell recommended 19 changes in undercover operations. ''Virtually all of them had </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> written all over them,'' Mr. Brown said. He said he had called Mr. Kelly to volunteer his office's help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for Mr. Kelly said that 16 of the 19 recommendations had already been put into practice, and that a major study on improving police firearms training would be finished within a month. Compared to most other big cities, New York police officers rarely fatally shoot anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death resulted from failures of individuals or of broad policies, the story of his last night is inescapably personal. He had been at a bachelor party at a Queens club on the eve of his wedding. On his way to the party, he had been pulled over by plainclothes police officers in a marked police van, provided his license, and everything was found to be in order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several hours and many drinks later, though, as he was about to drive home with two friends, he was approached by an undercover detective, Gescard F. Isnora, who said he had heard talk of a gun outside the club and thought it might be in Mr. Bell's car. There was no gun. Mr. Bell made a frenzied attempt to pull out of a parking spot. Detective Isnora, a veteran undercover officer who had never before used his gun, said he opened fire because he thought one of Mr. Bell's passengers was reaching for a weapon as Mr. Bell slammed his car backward and forward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora, who began the shooting, said his badge was pinned to his collar as he approached the car, shouting police commands. Other members of the team did not know he had his gun -- undercovers often don't carry them -- until he began firing. None of the police vehicles were marked. None used their lights and sirens. None of the officers wore raid jackets, which clearly identify a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The supervising lieutenant, Gary Napoli, was asked at the trial if he had checked on these items at the start of the night. ''I didn't conduct an inspection for every piece of equipment every night we went out, no,'' testified Lieutenant Napoli, who did not fire his weapon and was not charged with wrongdoing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, the Police Department says it requires that undercover supervisors have megaphones and portable light kits in their cars, and that they inspect the members of their team to make sure they have their equipment. Soon, the department will issue new raid jackets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the trial, the chief prosecutor, Charles A. Testagrossa, mentioned all of those as shortcomings on Nov. 25, 2006, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died. ''There's no way of sugarcoating it,'' he said. ''This was a slipshod operation.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Queens judge on Friday acquitted three detectives charged in the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who died on his wedding day in a hail of 50 police bullets. He said that prosecutors had failed to prove their case and that wounded friends of the slain man had given testimony that he did not believe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The top-to-bottom acquittals of Detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper were delivered by Justice Arthur J. Cooperman in an essay form bearing little resemblance to a standard jury verdict, and were met momentarily with silence in court as spectators looked at one another to be sure they had grasped what he was saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detectives, all but obscured behind a human wall of courthouse officers, finally seemed to exhale deeply, even crumple, with relief. Detective Oliver -- who reloaded his gun to fire a total of 31 shots and helped catapult the shooting from tragic mistake to a symbol, for many, of police abuse of force and poor training -- closed his eyes and cried. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Except for a few scuffles outside the Queens Criminal Court building and shouted displays of disbelief and outrage, the day passed peacefully amid calls for calm delivered by the mayor, the police commissioner and other officials. Still, the Rev. Al Sharpton, a spokesman for the Bell family, called for street protests and said people should get themselves arrested, ''whether it is on Wall Street, the judge's house or at 1 Police Plaza.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legal hurdles remain for the officers: federal authorities said they would now investigate the case, and the Police Department is mulling internal charges. A $50 million lawsuit against the city, filed last year by Mr. Bell's fiancee, who had two children with him, and the two men wounded in the shooting, may now begin moving forward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shooting of Mr. Bell, 23, outside a nightclub in Jamaica, Queens, early on Nov. 25, 2006, the morning of the day he was to be married, was the city's latest crucible for distilling questions about police treatment of people of color and the use of excessive force on unarmed black men. The shooting lasted seconds, but offered a glimpse of what it is to live in a neighborhood where black men and women are stopped and frisked at a higher rate than elsewhere in the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the case never became the racially charged lightning rod of its predecessors, like the case of Amadou Diallo, killed in 1999 in a hail of 41 shots. This was due in part to the race of the officers -- two of the three on trial were black -- and to the response of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who reached out to the victim's family in a stark contrast to the response of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani after Mr. Diallo was killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Further, trial testimony showed that Mr. Bell may have played some role, however unwitting, in the shooting, as he was drunk by legal standards when he pressed down on the accelerator of his fiancee's Nissan Altima and struck Detective Isnora in the leg in an attempt to flee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Justice Cooperman, who heard the case without a jury in State Supreme Court in Queens, listed his reasons for throwing out much of the testimony from Mr. Bell's group, including the number of times that witnesses were caught changing their story on the stand and the witnesses who had interests in the outcome because of the lawsuit against the city. Those issues, criminal backgrounds and the demeanor of the mostly young men on the witness stand ''had the effect of eviscerating the credibility of those prosecution witnesses,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for the detectives, the judge made it clear that he believed their versions of events over those of the young men involved, including Detective Isnora's statement that he had overheard Mr. Bell's friend Joseph Guzman twice say that he was going to get a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The court has found that the incident lasted just seconds,'' Justice Cooperman said. ''The officers responded to perceived criminal conduct; the unfortunate consequences of their conduct were tragic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But rather than call the shooting justified, the judge said that the prosecution failed to prove it was unjustified, as was its burden. Indeed, his ruling was far from approving of the detectives' conduct during the undercover vice operation that night. ''Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums,'' he said. He never mentioned the high number of shots fired, or the fact that Detective Oliver had fired 31 of them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Similar statements came from the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, whose office prosecuted the case. He said the trial ''revealed significant deficiencies in, among other things, supervision, tactical planning, communications and management accountability -- insufficiencies that need to be addressed.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who called the incident ''inexplicable'' and ''excessive'' in the days following the shooting, expressed sorrow for Mr. Bell's family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are no winners in a trial like this,'' he said. ''An innocent man lost his life, a bride lost her groom, two daughters lost their father, and a mother and a father lost their son. No verdict could ever end the grief that those who knew and loved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suffer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The verdict came 17 months to the day after five officers pointed their pistols at the car Mr. Bell was driving and opened fire. The shooting followed a confrontation between Mr. Bell and a stranger outside the Club Kalua, where Mr. Bell had attended his bachelor party. During the confrontation, Detective Isnora said, he heard the threat about getting the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the events that followed, Mr. Bell's car struck the detective's leg and, twice, a police van. Detective Isnora said he saw Mr. Guzman reach for his waistband, shouted ''Gun'' and fired. The three detectives who were brought to trial fired 46 of the 50 rounds, killing Mr. Bell and wounding Mr. Guzman and Trent Benefield, another friend of Mr. Bell's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detectives each spoke briefly at a press conference at the Detectives Endowment Association on Friday afternoon, variously thanking God, their families, lawyers and Justice Cooperman. ''This is the start of my life back,'' said Detective Cooper, who seemed to be fighting back tears. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States Department of Justice issued a statement announcing its own investigation. ''The Civil Rights Division and the United States attorney's office have been monitoring the state's prosecution of this case and, following the review of all the evidence, will take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes,'' the statement said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said an internal departmental investigation into the shooting, which could lead to a departmental trial and possible disciplinary actions up to termination, would be put on hold at the request of the federal authorities. This allows the Police Department, for the moment, to avoid the complex issue of meting out punishment to its own officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield left the courthouse without comment. Mr. Benefield -- singled out by name in the verdict as giving testimony that contradicted the evidence -- turned and shouted something back toward the officers guarding the building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Coincidentally, the judge paused in the reading of his verdict only once, to demand that a crying child be removed from the courtroom. It is unlikely that he had any idea that the child was Trent Benefield III.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell's parents, William and Valerie Bell, were sitting where they had been sitting, side by side, throughout the seven-week trial. Mrs. Bell had been looking toward the floor and blinking furiously during the verdict, and finally began to cry, covering her face while her husband stared straight ahead, looking at no one and shaking his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A woman sitting behind them broke the silence when she asked, ''Did he just say 'not guilty'?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Court officers hurried the three detectives out a back door. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As news of the acquittals rippled through clots of supporters of the Bell family, Mr. and Mrs. Bell led a column of friends and relatives, including Mr. Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre Bell, out of the courthouse. No one, including Mr. Sharpton, spoke, and the spectators on Queens Boulevard fell into a column and followed behind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown, the district attorney, said he accepted the verdict, calling Justice Cooperman ''one of this county's most respected and learned jurists.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I accept his verdict and I urge all fair-minded individuals in this city to do the same,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was asked if, in hindsight, he had any misgivings about the reading of the grand jury testimony of the three detectives from 2007 into the record during the trial. The readings were widely seen as something of a coup for the defense, with the detectives' accounts of the panic and uncertainty surrounding the shooting coming across without the detectives having to undergo cross-examination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That was a trial decision that was made, I think appropriately made,'' Mr. Brown said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lead prosecutor, Charles A. Testagrossa, an assistant district attorney, recalled criticism of the prosecution strategy of calling almost all the available witnesses, whether they were helpful or harmful to the prosecution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's very easy for people who are observing the trial to say, 'Gee, you called this witness, and not this witness,' '' he said. ''If you think that criticism could have made us work any harder, be more committed to obtaining a conviction in this case, then you had a right to criticize us. But the fact of the matter is, knowing how hard all of the members of this team worked,'' the criticism meant nothing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then he quoted one of his own witnesses, a stripper who appeared early in the trial: '' 'It is what it is.' ''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal verdicts almost always contain either one word or two. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict ran 1,164 words, a methodical and unusual look into a judge's examination of the burden of proof by the people of the County of Queens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The court did not view the victims or the N.Y.P.D. as being on trial here,'' Justice Arthur J. Cooperman said in a packed courtroom Friday in delivering his verdict on the detectives charged in Mr. Bell's death. But much of the most damning language was indeed directed at the victims, both at behavior that the judge saw as fomenting the tension that led to the shooting, and then at statements on the stand that he found dubious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his words the judge clearly favored the testimony of the detectives, given before a grand jury last year, over that of prosecution witnesses and, in particular, the two men wounded in the shooting, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision is notable for what it does not mention: one of the most explosive elements of the trial, the fact that 50 bullets were fired at three unarmed men, 31 of them by Detective Michael Oliver, who reloaded  in the middle of the fusillade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, Justice Cooperman makes it clear that it was his job to decide whether prosecutors proved their case -- that the officers were not justified when they opened fire -- and not whether they had performed their jobs poorly. That, he wrote, would be up to others to decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The verdict, in its cool, unadorned style, is a lesson in witness credibility and its key role in eliminating reasonable doubt.  In contrast to much of the heated testimony,  the verdict is written without flourish or pontification, beginning with a reminder to the gallery to keep quiet and recognition of the difficulty of the last two months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In many ways, this trial was a hardship,'' Justice Cooperman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first hint of which way the verdict was heading may have come, to some alert ears, soon after, when the judge seemed to pause to point out that ''establishments known as 'strip clubs' often generate criminal activity including prostitution and narcotics.'' If he had decided to convict the detectives, it would seem unlikely that he would point out valid reasons they had for being at Club Kalua that night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''An objective consideration of the proof ruled out sympathy and prejudice and any other emotional response to the issues presented,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said he leaned on evidence that suggested what was going through the detectives' minds and not Mr. Bell's. ''What the victims did was more pertinent to resolving the issues of fact than what may have been in their minds,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He suggested that whatever the police did wrong that night should be determined elsewhere: ''Carelessness and incompetence are not standards to be applied here, unless the conduct rises to the level of criminal acts.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge focused on testimony on two key moments: the argument between Mr. Bell and a stranger, Fabio Coicou, outside Club Kalua, and the seconds before Detective Gescard F. Isnora opened fire. In doing so, the judge said, he was aware that witnesses recalling the same event might  tell it a little differently. ''However,'' he wrote, ''where there are significant inconsistencies related to important facts, they should be considered.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What Justice Cooperman found in the testimony of the 50 prosecution witnesses were myriad significant inconsistencies. And he listed them among the reasons he found the prosecution's case to have failed: ''Prior inconsistent statements, inconsistencies in testimony among prosecution witnesses, the renunciation of prior statements, criminal convictions, the interest of some witnesses in the outcome of the case, the demeanor on the witness stand of other witnesses and the motive witnesses may have had to lie and the effect it had on the truthfulness of a witness's testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These factors,'' he continued, ''played a significant part in the people's ability to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and had the effect of eviscerating the credibility of those prosecution witnesses. And, at times, the testimony just didn't make sense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge seemed to single out the two key prosecution witnesses, Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield. Of the former, the judge simply stated that he believed what Detective Isnora said, that he had heard Mr. Guzman tell someone to get him his gun, a claim Mr. Guzman denied. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Justice Cooperman was harsher on Mr. Benefield, calling his credibility ''seriously impeached.'' He said Mr. Benefield's claims to have been shot while running away were contradicted by forensic evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By four-fifths of the way through the ruling, the judge still had not disclosed his verdict, but it was becoming clearer how he would rule. ''The police response with respect to each defendant was not proved to be criminal,'' he said, ''beyond a reasonable doubt.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He followed with a finding on a critical element in the prosecution's failure to show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ''The people have not proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that each defendant was not justified in the actions that each took,'' he wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The verdict's style surprised listeners who were expecting a rundown of the indictment's eight counts, with ''guilty'' or ''not guilty'' attached to each defendant's name. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The actual verdict only arrived with the last sentence: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Accordingly, the court finds each defendant not guilty of each of the respective counts in the indictment of which they were charged.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge announced the court to be in recess, and left the room.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A State Supreme Court justice's decision to acquit three police detectives in the November 2006 death of an unarmed man was stunning in its thorough absolution of the officers who fired 50 bullets at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two companions as they sat in a car outside a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Justice Arthur Cooperman found the three -- even one officer who reloaded his gun to squeeze off 31 rounds -- not guilty of all charges of manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As all New Yorkers should, we respect Justice Cooperman's verdict, but we do not believe all questions of accountability were resolved. Mr. Bell's family has said it plans to pursue a civil lawsuit, and federal prosecutors are examining the case. We hope they bring answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Large questions remain about the New York Police Department. In recent years, when police have killed unarmed men, they have been, almost without exception, black. The detectives on trial said that they believed Mr. Bell, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield had a gun, and based on that suspicion they fired away. No gun was found. Similarly, in 1999 police fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who was just reaching for his wallet. The acquittal of four police officers after that killing, which occurred during the racially challenged leadership of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, set off unrest in which scores were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anger and disappointment are understandable now, but New York's leadership has changed, and community activists need to absorb that fact before they attempt to heat up reaction. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly are trying to correct the conditions that led to the Bell shooting, changes that take time and good faith on all sides. Both men have kept a schedule of outreach to minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Progress has been steady. After the Bell shooting, Mr. Kelly ordered an independent study of department firearms training by the Rand Corporation. The results should be available soon. The commissioner hopes to prevent ''reflexive shooting'' after one officer fires an initial shot. Detective Michael Oliver alone managed to fire 31 of the 50 rounds toward Mr. Bell's car -- all in the few seconds following an initial shot from Gescard Isnora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The commissioner is also reforming undercover operations, including requiring breathalyzer tests after an officer fires a weapon. In the Bell shooting, undercover officers said that they stayed within the allowed limit of two alcoholic beverages, but they were not tested. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The margin of error once shooting begins has become distressingly small. The police have come to favor fast, easy-to-fire weapons like 9-millimeter semiautomatics. The rule that an officer is to pause and reassess after three shots can be forgotten in the heat of gunplay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We also wonder why the police continue to put themselves and others in harm's way with undercover operations at places like strip clubs. The club where Mr. Bell spent the night before his scheduled wedding was reputed to be a haven for prostitutes, drug dealers and gun traders. We suspect that it and others like it have health-  or fire-code violations that could shut them, without deadly risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his verdict, Justice Cooperman indicated that he found no carelessness or incompetence that rose ''to the level of criminal acts.'' We respect that judgment as a matter of law, but we see both carelessness and incompetence in the behavior of the police officers that must be corrected as a matter of public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four hours after their acquittal, Detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper appeared in a room crowded with reporters and cameras, speaking publicly for the first time since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died in a hail of 50 police bullets on his wedding day in November 2006. The detectives' remarks were brief and, with the exception of Detective Cooper's, all but stripped of emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Oliver's face was impassive, and but for his reddened eyes, almost unreadable. Detective Isnora held his mouth in a tight line, and his eyes were bloodshot. But it was only Detective Cooper, the third of the officers to be acquitted on Friday, who offered a telling glimpse of the burden he felt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Cooper had faced the least serious charge, reckless endangerment, in part for shooting through the window of an AirTrain station the night Mr. Bell died. He was the last of the detectives to speak, and when he stepped to the lectern, he gripped it with both hands, dropped his head, and drew a long, shaky breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'd like to, uh,'' he said, and then stopped. Seconds ticked by. His hands nervously worked the sides of the lectern, back and forth, back and forth, before he raised his head and picked up midstream, ''say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,'' he said. ''I'd like to thank the Lord, my savior, for today. This is the start of my life back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora, who fired 11 shots and was acquitted of first- and second-degree manslaughter and other charges, spoke first, standing in a packed basement conference room at the headquarters of the Detectives' Endowment Association in Lower Manhattan. ''Hi, good afternoon,'' he said, and then mumbled a bit before continuing, ''I'd like to thank the Lord Jesus Christ.'' He went on to thank his family and the judge in the case, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman. His remarks lasted less than 30 seconds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Oliver, who fired 31 shots and was also acquitted of first-  and second-degree manslaughter and other charges, had wept when the verdict was read, according to his lawyer, James J. Culleton. Yet at the news conference, the detective was largely impassive. ''Good afternoon, I'd like to just say thank you to all my family and friends,'' he said, before thanking the detectives' association, the judge and the defense lawyers in the case. His statement was just 36 words long and was nearly drowned out by the clatter of cameras clicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detectives arrived at the courthouse in Kew Gardens, Queens, about 8:30 a.m. to hear Justice Cooperman decide their fate. They used a side entrance, where a cordon of police officers and metal gates held back a throng of reporters and cameramen. They were whisked out a back door seconds after Justice Cooperman read his verdict, shortly after 9 a.m. News of the verdict caused roars of outrage in the crowd out front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is unclear what the future holds for the three detectives, who, according to the lawyers, are all eager to get back to regular police work. All three, who were initially suspended, surrendered their shields and guns and have been on desk duty, and may yet be disciplined by the Police Department. But first the United States attorney's office must weigh whether to pursue federal civil charges against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lawyers for each of the detectives said that their clients were still reeling from the shock and relief that the verdict had brought, and were not willing to give individual interviews. Each detective had been in deep retreat for the last 17 months, their lawyers said, rarely venturing outside their homes, and finding solace in family members and close friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's been hell for him,'' said Philip E. Karasyk, who represented Detective Isnora. ''He's been a nervous wreck.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora, 29, who is of Haitian and Mexican descent, was born in Brooklyn and lives in Bushwick with his mother. As a youngster he was a solid student, Mr. Karasyk said, attending the High School for Mathematics, Science and Engineering at City College and working as a lifeguard for the city. Mr. Karasyk said the Isnora family had been very proud when he became a police officer. But after the Bell shooting, neighborhood sentiment turned sharply against him, according to Pablo Rios, who lives across the street from the family. Mr. Rios said that Detective Isnora's sister was so routinely harassed as she made her way to work that she moved to Staten Island to get away from the hostility. ''Literally, she was scared,'' Mr. Rios said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Cooper, 40, lives in  Orange County with his wife and three children, said his lawyer, Paul P. Martin. Detective Cooper, who is black, was especially crushed by allegations that racism prompted the shooting, Mr. Martin said, because he had mentored black youngsters, worked to get guns off the street, and had been a member of the Guardians Association, a black fraternal group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's been ostracized,'' Mr. Martin said, ''and he felt betrayed by the African-American community.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Culleton, the lawyer, said that Detective Oliver had been ''vilified since Day 1.'' Since the shooting, Detective Oliver, 36, who grew up in New Jersey and now lives in Manhattan, had been characterized in some media accounts as somewhat of a playboy and bon vivant and was also labeled as arrogant. But Mr. Culleton said that his client was haunted by Mr. Bell's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is very upset with what happened,'' Mr. Culleton said. ''And he's going to have to deal with it for the rest of his life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the news conference, Michael J. Palladino, the president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, lashed out at critics of the Police Department and of the three detectives. He said the district attorney's office had omitted critical information when they presented the case to the grand jury, which indicted the three detectives. Mr. Palladino also leveled criticism at Mr. Bell's friends Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, who were both gravely injured in the shooting, and who testified during the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After offering his sympathy to the Bell family, Mr. Palladino quickly followed with a defense of the detectives, and of police work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have been portrayed as insensitive murderers,'' he said. ''And I can tell you that we are not.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Decades ago, Vesna Vulovic was the lone survivor of a plane bombing after plumetting more than 33,000 feet. In Serbia, she is a national heroine on par with the nation's tennis and basketball stars. She's now leveraging her considerable celebrity to campaign vigorously for the Democratic Party of President Boris Tadic, whose party trails in polls to the ultra-right Radical Party. ''I am like a cat. I have had nine lives,'' she said. ''But if nationalist forces in this country prevail, my heart will burst.''  PAGE A7</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Martin Lousteau, a 36-year-old economist who was trained at the London School of Economics, stepped down after less than five months as Argentina's economy minister, amid rising inflation and a long feud with farmers over tax policy. Though no reason was given for his resignation, an Argentine newspaper reported last week that he presented President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner with a plan meant to stabilize the country's economy in order to ''avoid a serious crisis.''

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Challenge to Roe v. Wade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2006, a ballot measure that would have banned abortion in South Dakota was defeated after an intense and expensive battle, 56 percent to 44 percent. Now the state is revisiting the question of a ban on abortion in a proposal that is widely seen as a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. Unlike the 2006 measure, the question being voted on by South Dakotans will include exceptions for rape, incest or issues that endanger the life and health of the child.  PAGE A10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A COZIER PLACE TO SIT AND WAIT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Los Angeles, low-income residents who rely on public transportation have taken tools, technical help and a little grant money to some neighborhood bus stops to turn them into what they are calling ''community living rooms'' in an effort to ease the wait for the bus. The simple furniture they build for the rooms is generally made of wood and includes chairs and ottomans.  PAGE A10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ATHEISM IN FOXHOLES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After convening a group of atheists and freethinkers at Camp Speicher in Iraq, Specialist Jeremy Hall and another soldier were berated by a superior officer who told them that the charges would be filed against them and they would be barred from re-enlistment. Specialist Hall filed a lawsuit saying that his First Amendment rights were violated. The lawsuit has raised questions about the effectiveness of the military's religious guidelines.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's now possible to get a ripe kiwi year-round thanks to the efficient global networks that transport food from all over the world. But the consequence of say, buying Argentina-grown lemons in Spain, is the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to ship it. The European Union, which imports more food than anywhere else in the world, is trying to tackle the problem by making freight-carrying flights buy permits for the pollution they generate (though sea freight may also require permits, too).

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wachovia Bank ended an 18-month investigation into its relationships with schemes that stole from thousands of victims -- many of them elderly -- by agreeing to pay $144 million. The settlement, which is the second-largest penalty ever demanded by the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, was criticized by some who said that the settlement agreement did not guarantee that victims would be paid.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shipping industry, despite producing twice as much carbon dioxide as aviation, isn't in a rush to go green despite the presence of cleaner technologies. Many ships burn heavy bunker fuel, which is called ''black yogurt'' for its consistency, and which researches say could speed up the melting of the polar ice caps and contribute to serious breathing illnesses and lung cancers.

Like Delta and Northwest, United and Continental hope to have regulatory approval of the deal done before President Bush leaves office, rather than face possible delays under a new administration.

Jean Veil, a lawyer for Societe Generale, said he was happy that Mr. Kerviel had secured employment. ''It means he will be in a position to start repaying the bank,'' Mr. Veil said.

For all of Mr. Amis's testimonies about the event's transformative impact, there is at least one way in which he has been thoroughly untouched by the atrocity: he is still busy with the pursuit of extraordinary sentences.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They felt angry and defiant and sad. Mostly, they felt empty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Three detectives had been on trial for a range of charges, from manslaughter to misdemeanor reckless endangerment. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> survivors and their supporters left the courthouse in Queens on Friday, after seven weeks of testimony and 17 months of mourning, with nothing but not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We just all gasped, like, 'Wow, how could you throw out this whole case?''' said Les Paultre, the father of Nicole Paultre Bell, who was to marry Mr. Bell the day  he was fatally shot by the police outside the strip club where his bachelor party had been  held. ''That's basically what the judge did. He just threw out this whole case.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Justice Arthur J. Cooperman read his verdict to the packed courtroom, a momentary silence was followed by sobs and words of disbelief  from Mr. Bell's relatives and supporters. Later  they headed to a cemetery on Long Island and bowed their heads over red flowers that marked Mr. Bell's grave. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Paultre Bell and her parents then retreated to their home a block from the beach in Far Rockaway, while their chief spokesman, the Rev. Al Sharpton, voiced outrage at the verdict in a radio program  broadcast from the headquarters of the National Action Network, an organization he founded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton, who has led protests over police shootings for decades, promised to lead protests -- he said he expected some people to be arrested -- possibly on Wall Street, in front of 1 Police Plaza, and perhaps outside the judge's home, starting as soon as Saturday. He also talked of a possible boycott, though he did not specify whom or what might be boycotted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're going to demonstrate to the government that New Yorkers will not take this abortion of justice lying down,'' Mr. Sharpton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He took particular umbrage at what he contended was Justice Cooperman's mention of the criminal history of the victims, and his comment that he found details of the testimony of  Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman,  Mr. Bell's friends who survived the shooting,  unbelievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The fact is, judge, he was shot,'' Mr. Sharpton practically spat. ''Duh, does it take a genius to figure out that a victim now has to give you a clinical definition of when he was shot? Maybe he didn't remember because he was in pain and maybe he didn't remember where because he was in the middle of running for his life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton also  argued that Justice Cooperman's ruling set the table for federal civil rights charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People with records,'' he said, ''do not lose their right to not be shot by police.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of Mr.  Bell's supporters who had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday morning said the judge's decision was the latest in a string of verdicts that condoned the killing of an innocent black man by a New York police officer. Two of the detectives who faced trial over Mr. Bell's killing are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We got the door slammed in our faces is how a lot of people feel,'' said Michael Hardy, a lawyer who represents Mr. Benefield, Mr. Guzman and Ms. Paultre Bell in a  civil suit that is pending against New York City. Mr. Hardy added, ''It tells you that no matter what, because of who you are and the community you come from, you will get nothing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Justice Cooperman pronounced the men not guilty in State Supreme Court in Queens, Ms. Paultre Bell, 23,  jumped up and sped out of the courtroom, weeping. A number  supporters followed, even as court officers urged them to remain in their seats until the judge had stepped down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside, hundreds of people spilled into the street. ''They're murderers,'' one man yelled, referring to the detectives. ''They're going to rot in hell where they belong.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Someone held a sign that read: ''People's Verdict: Guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At one point, Mr. Guzman sat on a stoop outside the courthouse, head in hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Harold James,  who had organized the bachelor party that preceded Mr. Bell's death, scowled. ''Don't talk to me, man,'' he said. ''It's not a good day.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Led by Mr. Sharpton, the Bell family, Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield left the courthouse without comment. As they rounded Queens Boulevard toward a parking lot, reporters and photographers swarmed around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the Bell supporters got into a shoving match with an Associated Press photographer. The supporter's friends tried to restrain him and police officers rushed to regain order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hours later, outside Mr. Sharpton's headquarters in Harlem, three young black men staged a protest, one of them dressed as a Klansman  with ''N.Y.P.D.'' written on the sheet draped over his head. Members of Mr. Sharpton's organization asked the men to leave, saying, ''We don't need this.'' But the men refused to go, and there was arguing for 10 minutes until they finally left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier, at Nassau Knolls Cemetery and Memorial Park in Port Washington, Ms. Paultre Bell, who took Mr. Bell's name after his death, took a call on Mr. Sharpton's cellphone from Gov. David A. Paterson and placed flowers on Mr. Bell's grave. ''She promised they wouldn't stop fighting for justice,'' Mr. Sharpton said later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Throughout Friday afternoon, several people came and went from Ms. Paultre Bell's home, including Mr. Guzman, who declined to speak with reporters. Miles away in Jamaica, Mr. Benefield, wearing a T-shirt bearing Mr. Bell's picture, sat on a bench with friends in the courtyard of his housing complex. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier, Mr. Benefield told reporters that he was going to fight on, insisting the officers had committed a crime and ''have to pay a price.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Paultre Bell's father said that the family received a taunting telephone call Friday afternoon and that the caller identification suggested it came from someone at the Sergeants Benevolent Association, a police supervisors' union. The association's president, Edward D. Mullins, said he would investigate. ''If it happened in our office, I want to know who did it,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Paultre Bell, Mr. Guzman, Mr. Benefield and Mr. Bell's parents, William and Valerie, are expected to speak at Mr. Sharpton's headquarters Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're not going to give up,'' Ms. Paultre Bell's father said on Friday afternoon. ''We're going to keep pushing forward because Sean did not die in vain, and these young men should not have been stopped in the first place.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only one of the three detectives acquitted yesterday of killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a 50-bullet barrage outside a Queens strip club offered an apology to the slain groom's family.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their first public statements since the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting, Detective Marc Cooper appeared with his co-defendants, Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora. On the verge of tears, Cooper said, &quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;I'd like to thank the Lord, my savior. I've just started my life back.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper was found not guilty of reckless endangerment after firing four bullets during the fusillade. He spoke at a Detectives Endowment Association press conference hours after he, Isnora and Oliver were found not guilty on all charges of opening fire on the 23-year-old father of two.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the detectives testified on their own behalf during the trial. Instead, prosecutors read aloud each of their grand-jury testimonies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, inside a packed and emotion-filled courtroom, Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the not-guilty verdict, saying the detectives' version of events was more credible than those of prosecution witnesses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police response with respect to each defendant was not proved to be criminal,&quot; said Cooperman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's weeping fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, stormed out of the courtroom after the decision was announced. His mother, Valerie, collapsed outside.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry protesters screamed &quot;Murderers! Murderers!&quot; and &quot;KKK!&quot; near the courthouse as fistfights broke out in the crowd. However, no one was arrested.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Far Rockaway, Bell's father, William, called the verdict &quot;a slap in the face and a kick in the ass,&quot; according to WABC/Channel 7.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and Isnora, who faced manslaughter raps, did not have any words for Bell's family. Instead, they thanked their families and Cooperman, who decided the case in Queens Supreme Court after the defense opted against a jury trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who fired 31 bullets, said Cooperman made a &quot;fair and just decision.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora called the verdict &quot;fair and accurate.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments yesterday:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Justice Department, joined by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and the FBI, said it will review the case to determine whether to charge the detectives with civil rights violations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* City Comptroller Bill Thompson, the highest-ranking elected black official in the city, said he was &quot;disappointed and absolutely stunned.&quot; He called the shooting &quot;excessive use of force by the police.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gov. Paterson said that &quot;we're a society of laws and . . . we accept the findings of that legal proceeding.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Presidential candidate Barack Obama called the killing a &quot;tragedy&quot; but urged calm and respect for the judge's decision.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* About 1,000 extra cops remained on duty through the night in case of an emergency. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly would not comment on the verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mayor Bloomberg, who called the shooting &quot;excessive&quot; days after the tragedy, refused to back down from those comments. He also said &quot;there are no winners in a trial like this.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A dejected Queens DA Richard Brown accepted the verdict and said Cooperman &quot;discharged his responsibilities fairly and conscientiously under the law.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Following the verdict, the family visited Bell's grave in Port Washington, LI.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On his radio show, the Rev. Al Sharpton called on people to stage protests outside Cooperman's Queens home this weekend, prompting cops to escort the jurist.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, about 100 protesters swarmed the 103rd Precinct in Jamaica, shouting &quot;F- - - the police&quot; and &quot;Blue-eyed devils&quot; at dozens of cops who stood shoulder to shoulder. The demonstrators then marched down Jamaica Avenue to club Kalua, where the 2006 tragedy unfolded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along the way, they flipped garbage cans, newsstands and a portable toilet, and tossed glass bottles at cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the group reached the corner of 150th Street and Archer Avenue, the crowd was told to disperse.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the protesters was arrested, as was a representative from the Legal Aid Guild who tried to intervene.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, another group marched from the courthouse to the site of the shooting, chanting &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; and &quot;Whose streets? Our streets!&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict came 17 months to the day after the shooting outside the Jamaica club, where friends had come for Bell's bachelor party hours before he was to be married.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 74-year-old judge said the prosecution's case was undermined by &quot;prior inconsistent statements&quot; of some of Bell's friends - specifically Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, who were in the car with him and also suffered bullet wounds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman said that &quot;at times, the testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Oliver, who showed no emotion throughout the two-month trial, openly wept. Isnora hugged his lawyer.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the detectives been found guilty, Oliver, 36, and Isnora, 29 could have been sentenced to 25 years behind bars. Cooper, 40, faced a year in prison.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Assistant DA Charles Testagrossa said he couldn't &quot;really say we would have done things differently.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very easy for people who are observing the trial to say, 'Well, gee, you called this witness, why'd you call that witness?' &quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also shrugged off assertions that he did not properly prepare witnesses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora told a grand jury last year that he heard Bell's friend Guzman say, &quot;Yo, go get my gun,&quot; after a fight outside Kalua and decided to call for backup.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell tried to drive away and the cops began shooting, witnesses said.      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It isn't right,&quot; Benefield said as he walked out of court. &quot;If we had been the shooters, we'd be in jail right now.&quot; Additional reporting by Samuel Goldsmith, Perry Chiaramonte, James Fanelli, David Seifman, Lorena Mongelli, Stefanie Cohen, Peter Cox, Tom Liddy, Patrick Gallahue and Fredric U. Dicker  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">---- </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The court has found that the people's ability to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt was affected by . . . witnesses' prior inconsistent statements, inconsistencies in testimony among prosecution witnesses, the renunciation of prior statements, criminal convictions, the interest of some witnesses in the outcome of the case, the demeanor on the witness stand of other witnesses and the motive witnesses may have had to lie and the effect it had on the truthfulness of a witness's testimony.' </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may have come out winners in court, but the three cops acquitted in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting will still find themselves parked behind desks come Monday morning.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And getting their guns back remains a long shot, police sources said yesterday.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Slim to none&quot; is how one police official put their chances of carrying a weapon again.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper will all cool their heels pushing paper while they await possible federal prosecution, civil suits and departmental hearings stemming from the November 2006 shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this point they are on modified assignment and expected back in their commands on Monday,&quot; said Michael Palladino, who heads the detectives union.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they won't be running into each other.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver has been assigned to the Detective Borough Manhattan, Cooper will spend his days at Detective Borough Bronx, and Isnora has been dispatched to Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, law-enforcement sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their duties could include answering phones, and filing, faxing and filling out sick reports.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such has been the fate of other cops involved in high-profile shootings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Boss, who in 1999 was found not guilty in the 41-shot killing of unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo, has been working as a department mechanic at Floyd Bennett Field. He is still fighting to get his gun back.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Neri, never indicted in the 2004 Brooklyn rooftop shooting death of unarmed teen Timothy Stansbury, is in the Property Clerk's Office in Whitestone, Queens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Attorney's Office said yesterday its Civil Rights Division has ordered an &quot;independent review of the facts and circumstances&quot; to determine if it will prosecute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once all of that shakes out, the NYPD will decide whether to bring departmental charges against the detectives, though police sources said firing the cops would infuriate many in the ranks.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Morale is already at an all-time low,&quot; said one detective. &quot;If these guys were ever fired, no cop should ever write another summons or make another arrest again.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM Day 1, I was on my own.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I alone in the media saw the case against the cops who shot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an absolute stinker - a trial that pitted three men who tried to protect innocent lives against every stripper, crackhead and thug in the borough of Queens.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turns out, I was right. And I wanted to feel good about the verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then, I spoke to Detective Marc Cooper. And the heart of this cop was with the family of the man he killed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're hurting,&quot; he told me, his voice gentle as tears. &quot;Everybody is different. We are not robots.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These last two months, Cooper was painted as the sympathetic figure standing trial in the fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one dank and desperate night at the Queens club Kalua.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he defended his colleague, Detective Michael Oliver, who has been tarred, featured, tried and convicted in the press of extreme arrogance. Of being a &quot;robot.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the second this loser of a trial was over, and Justice Arthur Cooperman made it clear to everyone - save perhaps Al Sharpton and Michael Bloomberg - that no crime was committed in the tragic death of Bell, Oliver did something remarkable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The iceman melteth. He cried. Openly and uncontrollably, for all to see.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's over.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the acquittal, the first words out of Cooper's mouth were for the Bell family.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; he said, choking up.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With yesterday's decision, perhaps this city may start to heal. Detectives Cooper, Oliver and Gescard Isnora are not going to jail. Why they went on trial in the first place is a mystery steeped in politics and ill will from which this city has to recover.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Cooper, it's not finished. Not for any of these men.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, acquitted of reckless endangerment, is the only man who stood trial in Bell's death who is a husband and father. Cooper understands dread in ways others can only imagine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hoping to get my family back,&quot; he told me.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These last two months have been stressful on Cooper's wife and children, ages 13 and 5.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Cooper if he was going to celebrate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going home to sleep,&quot; he said. &quot;I've been sleeping two hours a night for months.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Oliver regained his composure. But first he thanked me for seeing this case for what it was.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My family appreciates your articles,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank me? You put your life on the line and nearly lost everything, because you did your job. I thank you.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's death, sadly, was caused by a potent mixture of booze and bravado. It represents a dark period in this city that began when Mayor Bloomberg declared Bell's shooting &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; - before any investigation was done.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But prosecutor Charles Testagrossa put on a half-assed show trial, in which his own witnesses continually tripped themselves up and made it clear they were looking for big civil judgments from the city.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This city will recover. It always does. But I fear one thing:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor - how many will fear to join the police force now? </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered a fair verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting case, setting aside both emotion and victims' conflicting accounts, top criminal lawyers said yesterday.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on the facts, this case was going to be extremely difficult to develop from a prosecutor's perspective, with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, given the chaos that preceded the moments when the shots were fired,&quot; defense lawyer Benjamin Brafman said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case was just headed for disaster when the facts began to crystallize.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many said the key witnesses' criminal pasts and inconsistent stories only added to the difficulty in proving that the officers fired without justification.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based upon what I understand of the testimony, it was easy for a judge to say there was reasonable doubt,&quot; said Ronald Aiello, a former Brooklyn judge now in private practice. &quot;A jury would never have decided this case. You would have had a hung jury.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Montgomery, a former Brooklyn prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer, said, &quot;The judge seemed to have been the perfect juror.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mother collapsed at the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, rushed from the courtroom stricken with grief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father, William Bell was just plain angry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a slap in the face and a kick in the ass,&quot; he told WABC/Channel 7 outside Paultre-Bell's Far Rockaway, Queens, home. &quot;Here's a judge that says he didn't care about the law. All he care about is what he felt . . . To me, what's that supposed to mean, we're back in Alabama?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After learning at 9 a.m. that the three officers charged in the 2006 death of her son would go free, mom Valerie burst into tears in court. She and William left the courthouse a short time later and made their way though a wild crowd of protesters to a small motorcade waiting to take them away.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, fistfights broke out, as people held signs with slogans: &quot;50 Shots. 50 More Reasons We Need Revolution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trent Benefield, a friend of Bell who was also shot outside club Kalua, yelled, &quot;Not guilty. Not guilty. It's real.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mass of protesters, cops and media was so thick that the Bells were forced to walk on the street. At one point, Valerie - wearing a pin with her son's face on it - fainted, and was caught by supporters. Bell's family made no statement after the verdict, but Nicole's mom, Laura Harper Paultre, later said she was disappointed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is upset. We were hoping for a guilty verdict but we're not surprised,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncle of one of Bell's friends injured that night was outraged at the decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They got away with murder,&quot; said Joseph Guzman's uncle Elliot Hankerson, who was with them at the club on Nov. 25, 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you empty your gun and reload it and start shooting again? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mother and about two dozens family and friends - including the Rev. Al Sharpton - gathered at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grave at Nassau Knolls Cemetery in Port Washington, LI, later in the morning. For 90 minutes, they prayed and mourned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre-Bell, who was to be wed to Bell on the day he was killed, was the last to leave, kneeling and saying her good-byes alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group left behind a vase filled with flowers, including a rose, orchids and lilacs.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the day, police were called to Paultre-Bell's after the family received prank phone calls.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about the same time, the family learned they would get their wish for federal prosecutors to look into the case as a civil-rights violation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[We] will conduct an independent review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two others,&quot; the Department of Justice said in a statement yesterday. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUR chests swell with pride each time Barack Obama speaks of hope. He could be president, we tell ourselves - the change Sam Cooke sang can soon be real.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's a reality check, and it smacks us in the face.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, go ahead, anoint this new black savior. That won't mean your brothers and sons will be safe when they drive at night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make all the history you want. That doesn't mean a cop's bullet - or 50 for that matter - will be any less discriminating.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's inspiring to see Obama at the edge of glory. And if a verdict like the one from Queens doesn't inspire black people to vote, nothing else will.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how far have we come really in the face of an insult like this?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What could President Obama say about a country in which a black actor can get three years in prison on a misdemeanor tax charge, but black victims can't get any measure of justice for a state-sanctioned execution?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As news helicopters hovered yesterday above the grave where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lay, it was hard to imagine a different world, even with an Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do you hope when the system gives police yet another license to kill?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do you dream when a judge says a life isn't worth even one conviction?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that isn't at least reckless, then nothing is. Ever.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, against all this, we vote for change and maintain what Obama calls the audacity of hope. One day, it will be even stronger than the power to acquit.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg is flat wrong when he says &quot;there are no winners&quot; in yesterday's verdict in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting trial.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the rule of law?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman was a big winner, too: He showed - by acquitting the three police officers on all charges - that politically charged cases can be judged solely on the basis of the facts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's exactly what Cooperman did in finding that the fatal shooting of Bell and the wounding of two others outside the Kalua strip club in Jamaica - notorious for drugs, guns and prostitution - &quot;was not proved to be criminal.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the right verdict - as counterintuitive as that may seem. When cops fire 50 shots, there should be a war on, right?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrong: The fact is that the law gives &quot;peace officers&quot; - a legal term that includes cops - substantial discretion in the use of deadly force.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a matter of law, police officers are allowed to open fire if they reasonably believe their lives to be in danger - and once the shooting starts, the number of shots fired isn't really relevant.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, NYPD officers are trained to keep shooting until the danger has passed - and that is sound policy, too.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and to Amadou Diallo before him - was tragic. No one fairly can deny that.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But criminalizing tragic outcomes - everything else being equal - only emboldens criminals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chance that other officers would hesitate when they perceive themselves to be in mortal danger for fear that they might face up to 25 years behind bars (the sentence that Detective Michael Oliver could have faced if found guilty yesterday) is unthinkable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would be unfair to cops - and, by extension, to the law-abiding citizens they're sworn to protect.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But was it reasonable for the Bell officers to fear for their lives?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, as a matter of law, it was up to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown to prove otherwise: That's what &quot;presumption of innocence&quot; means.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event, as Justice Cooperman's verdict in the non-jury trial demonstrates, Brown's office failed to prove that what Oliver and his fellow detectives, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper, did was unjustified.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman found that the prosecution's evidence simply didn't hold up - that, in fact, the testimony of prosecution witnesses often &quot;didn't make sense.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, the Rev. Al Sharpton was quick to ridicule the judge for declaring that Trent Benefield's &quot;credibility was seriously impeached&quot; because forensic evidence disproved his claim that he'd been shot while running away.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, what really undermined Benefield's credibility was his admission on the stand that he was drunk when the shooting started - and that he'd been high on marijuana every day for six years before the incident.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And testimony clearly indicated that another shooting victim, Joseph Guzman, had threatened to retrieve a gun, and then seemed to be reaching for a weapon when Bell's car collided with a police van - which set off the police shootings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The officers responded to perceived criminal conduct&quot; by the victims, said the judge. &quot;The unfortunate consequences of their conduct were tragic.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not a crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We trust that the US Justice Department, which yesterday announced its own investigation of the case, will arrive at the same conclusion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton et al. have promised a healthy dose of the usual bombast - and that is their right.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we also trust that reasonable New Yorkers will conclude that Judge Cooperman's verdict was, in fact, reasonable.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that justice was served. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much credit does Michael Bloomberg deserve for the relative calm that's followed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict? It's a question that's more than just academic, given the potential for racially fraught episodes just like this one to have a defining impact on a mayoral legacy - and on a mayor's political fortunes moving forward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to veteran New York political reporter Andrew Kirtzman, who I emailed for his take on the question, Bloomberg has been more lucky than skillful in presiding over what has been, so far, a restrained fallout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's Kirtzman's take, from early this weekend:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming the streets stay calm through the weekend, a lot of credit is going to flow Michael Bloomberg's way. The conventional wisdom is that the mayor has calmed racial tensions in the city in the last few years by eschewing the kind of hot-headed rhetoric for which Rudy Giuliani was derided. Yet the only major riot to break out in modern times didn't occur under Giuliani; it occurred under David Dinkins, in Crown Heights. Whatever you may think of him, Dinkins never fanned the flames of anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My point is that restraint from City Hall only gets you so far in these situations. The truth is that Bloomberg has been pretty lucky when it comes to race relations: Economic times have been good; minority neighborhoods are flowering and safer than ever (a trend that began under Giuliani); an African-American running for president is sparking hope in poor neighborhoods and Harlem has sent one of its own to the governor's mansion. Then there's the fact that Al Sharpton has grown decidedly less militant over the years. Today he's more of a political power-broker than a street activist, and no one has come close to assuming his former role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg has benefited from a lot of these trends. As a result, he's been mostly spared the hornet's nest of racial conflict. If, God forbid, a racial conflagration were to result from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> verdict, it would be represent the mayor's first real test. Whether he'd emerge looking like a fair-minded healer or an out of touch billionaire is something we don't really know. Let's hope we never have to find out.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE detectives in the United States were acquitted of all charges yesterday in the near 50-shot killing of an unarmed groom on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a New York courtroom packed with spectators, including victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fiancee and parents, with at least 200 people gathered outside the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-profile case put the New York Police Department at the centre of yet another dispute over the alleged use of excessive firepower. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict provoked an outpouring of emotions. Bell's fiancee immediately walked out; his mother cried and gasps were heard throughout the room.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old black man, died in a hail of gunfire outside a strip club in Queens on 25 November 2006 - his wedding day - as he was leaving his stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Marc Cooper, 40, was charged only with reckless endangerment. Two other officers were not charged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manslaughter charges carried up to 25 years in prison; the penalty for reckless endangerment is a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's fiancee, parents and their supporters have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers took the stand. Instead, Justice Cooperman heard transcripts of the three testifying before a grand jury that they believed they had good reason to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also heard from Mr Bell's two companions, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, who insisted the incident erupted without warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both were wounded, and Mr Guzman still has four bullets lodged in his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day Mr Bell decided to have a last-minute stag party at Kalua Cabaret, the undercover detectives' had chosen to investigate reports of prostitution at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the club closed at about 4am, Isnora, and Hispolito Sanchez, another undercover detective, claimed they overheard Mr Bell and his friends taunt a stranger, who responded by putting his right hand in his pocket as if he had a gun.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora said he decided to arm himself, call for backup and follow the trio as they went to Mr Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that after he warned the men to halt, Mr Bell pulled away and rammed an unmarked police van with Oliver at the wheel. Isnora said Mr Guzman made a sudden move as if he were reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I yelled, 'Gun!' and fired,&quot; he said. &quot;In my mind, I knew he had a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Guzman said Isnora &quot;appeared out of nowhere&quot; with a gun drawn and shot him in the shoulder - the first of 16 shots to enter his body. &quot;That's all there was - gunfire,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tyres screeching, glass breaking and bullets flying, the officers said they believed they were under attack. Oliver responded by emptying his semiautomatic pistol, reloading, and emptying it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when Mr Bell's blood-splattered car was examined, no weapon was found inside it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, April 25</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York judge on Friday acquitted three police officers in the killing of an unarmed man in a 50-shot fusillade on his wedding day, a racially charged incident that had sparked debate and protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the police officers -- Detectives Gescard Isnora and Michael Oliver, who were acquitted of manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment, and Detective Marc Cooper, who was found not guilty of reckless endangerment -- could still face charges: The Justice Department announced after the verdict that it will review the case to determine whether to prosecute the officers for violating the victim's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who attended court Friday alongside the family of the victim, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he will launch a series of nonviolent protests Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After State Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Cooperman announced his verdict, Nicole Paultre Bell, the victim's fiancee and mother of his two daughters, who took his name after his death, left the courtroom in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the Queens courtroom, hundreds of Bell's supporters responded emotionally, some yelling, &quot;No, no, no!&quot; or &quot;Murderers! Murderers!&quot; Others sobbed, prayed or fell to their knees. Supporters marched into the streets and had a few brief scuffles with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This community is angry,&quot; said Fay Persaud, a real estate agent from the Jamaica section of Queens, where the shooting happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We told the people on the block, 'Listen, let's give the court a chance,' &quot; said Leroy Gadsden, chair of the legal department of the state chapter of the NAACP. &quot;Now we want to see federal involvement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaving the courthouse, Bell's fiancee and his parents visited his grave site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of Bell, a black man, revived memories of previous instances of alleged police brutality in New York, such as the 1999 slaying of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who was gunned down in a 41-shot barrage by police officers in the Bronx. But the official responses to the two incidents were starkly different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg voiced criticism of the officers' actions in the Bell case, suggesting the detectives may have used &quot;excessive force.&quot; Bloomberg has met with Sharpton and Bell's fiancee and, after the verdict, offered comments aimed at soothing tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no winners in a trial like this,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;An innocent man lost his life, a bride lost her groom, two daughters lost their father, and a mother and father lost their son. No verdict could ever end the grief that those who knew and loved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bloomberg cautioned that the decision must be respected. &quot;Though not everyone will agree with the verdicts and opinions issued by the courts, we accept their authority,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg's actions contrasted with those of his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who, just hours before a grand jury handed up indictments for murder in the Diallo case, gave a sharply worded speech to police officers declaring, &quot;We have a right to demand more respect from the citizens of the city for the police officers of the city of New York.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four officers in that case were found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was killed around 4 a.m. on Nov. 25, 2006, as he and two friends left his bachelor party at a strip club in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys contended that Bell and his friends had argued with a man outside the club and that undercover officers then followed them to their car, believing they were retrieving a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no gun, all parties now agree. But Isnora, who was in plainclothes, pointed his own Glock pistol at Bell's car. Witnesses' accounts varied as to whether Isnora identified himself as a police officer and whether Bell, the driver, rammed the car into him. Isnora, Oliver and Cooper fired their weapons at the car, shooting 11, 31 and four times, respectively. Four shots were fired by two other officers on the scene; one was not charged, and the other was not indicted in the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of bullets fired by Isnora, Oliver and Cooper, two of whom are black, raised the question of whether they used excessive force. But the conflicting testimony at the trial created a muddled picture of what happened late at night, in the dark, after some drinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing his decision, Cooperman said he was troubled by inconsistencies among witnesses, as well as contradictions in accounts before the grand jury and in trial testimony. &quot;At times the testimony just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he also considered the past criminal convictions of some of the prosecution's witnesses and what he described as a motive to lie to reap monetary rewards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fiancee and the two friends injured in the incident -- Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31 -- have filed a $50 million civil rights and wrongful-death lawsuit against the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the decision, the officers appeared at a news conference. &quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; Cooper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, said: &quot;We are relieved today, and how do I spell relief? N-O-T G-U-I-L-T-Y.&quot; He responded indignantly to Sharpton's suggestion that the verdicts were not fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's despicable for him to say that because we have the greatest criminal justice system on Earth,&quot; Palladino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said he will delay any departmental investigation of the officers until their legal defense is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the police department was ready to manage protests: &quot;We don't anticipate violence, but we are prepared for any contingency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was mentioned  on the presidential campaign trail. &quot;The judge has made his ruling, and we're a nation of laws, so we respect the verdict that came down,&quot; said Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), in response to a question in Indianapolis. &quot;The most important thing for people who are concerned about that shooting is to figure out how do we come together and assure those kinds of tragedies don't happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) issued a statement from her Senate office, saying New Yorkers must &quot;embrace this opportunity to take steps -- in our communities, in our law enforcement agencies, and in our government -- to make sure this does not happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a New York courtroom packed with spectators including victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fianc&eacute;e and parents, and at least 200 people gathered outside the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-profile case put the New York Police Department at the centre of another dispute involving allegations of excessive firepower </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict provoked an outpouring of emotions. Bell's fianc&eacute;e immediately walked out of the room; his mother cried and gasps were heard throughout the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of &quot;No!&quot; and &quot;Not guilty!&quot; erupted in the crowd outside the courthouse, and dozens of people began crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, a 23-year-old black man, was killed in a hail of gunfire outside a strip club in Queens on November 25 2006 - his wedding day as he was leaving a stag party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Officer Marc Cooper, 40, was charged only with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers were not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver fired 31 shots; Isnora fired 11 rounds; and Cooper shot four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers, complaining that pre-trial publicity had unfairly painted them as cold-blooded killers, opted to have the judge decide the case rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge indicated that the police officers' version of events was more credible than the victims' version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people have not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that each defendant was not justified&quot; in firing, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conviction on manslaughter could have brought up to 25 years in prison; the penalty for reckless endangerment, is a year behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case brought back painful memories of other NYPD shootings, such as the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo - an African immigrant who was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets by police officers who mistook his wallet for a gun. The acquittal of the officers in that case created a storm of protest and demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood surrounding this case has been muted by comparison, although Mr Bell's fianc&eacute;e, parents and their supporters have held rallies demanding that the officers - two of whom are black - be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, many in the crowd began weeping after hearing the verdict. Others were enraged, swearing and screaming &quot;Murderers! Murderers!&quot; or &quot;KKK!&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence had painted the victims as drunken thugs who the officers believed were armed and dangerous. Prosecutors sought to convince the judge that the victims had been minding their own business, and that the officers were inept, trigger-happy aggressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the officers took the stand. Instead, Justice Cooperman heard transcripts of the officers testifying before a grand jury, saying they believed they had good reason to use force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also heard testimony from Mr Bell's two companions - Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman - who insisted the incident erupted without warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Benefield and Mr Guzman were both wounded; Mr Guzman still has four bullets lodged in his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims and defendants were set on a fateful collision course by a pair of innocuous decisions: Mr Bell's to have a last-minute stag party at Kalua Cabaret, and the undercover detectives' to investigate reports of prostitution at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the club closed around 4am, Sanchez and Isnora claimed they overheard Mr Bell and his friends first flirt with women, then taunt a stranger who responded by putting his right hand in his pocket as if he had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Guzman, they testified, said: &quot;Yo, go get my gun&quot; - something Mr Bell's friends denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora said he decided to arm himself, call for back-up and tail the trio as they went around the corner and got into Mr Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that after warning the men to halt, Mr Bell pulled away and rammed an unmarked police van with Oliver at the wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective also alleged that Mr Guzman made a sudden move as if he were reaching for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Benefield and Mr Guzman testified that there were no orders. Instead, Guzman said, Isnora &quot;appeared out of nowhere&quot; with a gun drawn and shot him in the shoulder - the first of 16 shots to enter his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's all there was - gunfire,&quot; he said. &quot;There wasn't nothing else.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">690 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge in New York today cleared three detectives on all charges involved in the killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the bridegroom who died in a hail of 50 police bullets outside a nightclub on the eve of his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict was met with quiet tears from Bell's mother. Outside the crowded courtroom, where demonstrators carried signs reading: &quot;50 shots isn't justice&quot;, there were shouts, tears and anger as the verdict was pronounced. Some protesters shouted &quot;murderers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police blocked off the steps of the courthouse with metal barricades, and hustled the three police detectives away through a side door. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, had just left his bachelor party at a club in Jamaica, Queens when he was shot and killed on November 25 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of his friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were also wounded as the three plainclothed police detectives opened fire on Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three of the men in the car were unarmed and the shooting -- which recalled a 1999 episode in which an unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo was shot dead by police -- brought fierce criticism of the detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after a seven-week trial, Judge Arthur Cooperman today ruled that the three police officers -- Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper -- bore no criminal responsibility for the death of Bell or the wounding of his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and Isnora, who were charged with manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment, had faced a maximum of 25 years in prison. Cooper had faced a single charge of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three had elected to be tried before a judge, rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his verdict, the judge said that he simply did not believe the testimony of many of the prosecution's witnesses -- including Bell's two wounded companions on that night. &quot;The testimony of those witnesses just didn't make sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's parents sat in silence as the judge gave his decision, but his fiancee, Nicole Paultre Bell, walked out. Other spectators erupted in disbelief. &quot;Did he just say, 'not guilty'?&quot; one woman was reported as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the court, Leroy Gadsen, who had been monitoring the trial for the Naacp, was outraged at the verdict. &quot;We haven't heard of any of these people having a gun or threatening anybody and yet we hear the verdict not guilty,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case is not about justice. It is about the ability of the police to act above the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, who had been critical of the shooting earlier, said that the judge had followed his duty to decide the case on evidence presented in his courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no winners in a trial like this,&quot; Bloomberg said in a statement. &quot;An innocent man lost his life, a bride lost her groom, two daughters lost their father, and a mother and a father lost their son. No verdict could ever end the grief of those who knew and loved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tragic events of that November night began unspooling when Bell and his friends got into an argument outside the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bachelor party had no idea that the Club Kahlua was then under police surveillance as part of an investigation into prostitution. Oliver, Isnora and Cooper had recently come on shift when the argument erupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of witnesses testified that they heard talk of guns during the argument, and that Guzman had said: &quot;yo, go get my gun&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police -- who were not in uniform -- decided to follow Bell and his friends out to their car. They told the court they feared talk of guns during the argument could lead to a shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Isnora, he then identified himself as a police detective, clipping his badge on his collar and shouting out: &quot;police&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Guzman and Benefield said they heard no warning and had no idea that Isnora was with police when he walked up to their car with his gun drawn. They say the gunfire erupted without any warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police, for their part, claimed that Guzman may have helped provoke the shooting by urging Bell to drive away. The police claim that they opened fire only after Bell nudged Isnora with his car -- pushing him into an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, 36, then fired at Bell's car 31 times. Isnora, 29, fired 11 shots and Cooper, 40, four.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Detective Michael Oliver has endured an eight-week trial in a Queens courtroom and a year-and-a-half-long trial in the New York tabloids and the court of public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the day of judgment has come for the Clifton native and two other NYPD detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and the other officers are on trial for the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed man who was killed November 2006 in a hail of police gunfire outside a Queens strip club, hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Cooperman, who heard the case without a jury, was expected to render his verdict this morning before a packed courtroom of reporters, police officials and friends and family of the slain man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will wait to hear whether Oliver, who infamously fired 31 of the 50 bullets at Bell's Nissan Altima, and another detective, Gescard Isnora, are guilty of first- and second-degree manslaughter. Both detectives face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. Cooperman also will rule on a third detective, Marc Cooper, who is charged with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His verdict - guilty or not - will cap an explosive case that has haunted both New York City and those who have known Oliver long before his chiseled yet impassive face became front-page fodder and the inspiration of blistering tabloid headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades, New York has been troubled by police shootings of unarmed black men; more troubling to civil rights activists, however, is the fact that the courts have cleared most of these officers, including the four cops who in 1999 mistook a wallet for a handgun and unleashed a barrage of bullets on Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Longtime friends of Oliver have said they have been stunned by how vicious he has been painted by New York media, friends and family of Bell and the prosecutors in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He liked to party but he never had a mean streak in him,&quot; said Tony Zlotkowski, 35, of Clifton, who has known Oliver since high school. He said he hoped Cooperman would find his friend &quot;innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got to hope for the best,&quot; Zlotkowski said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But few could guess which way Cooperman will swing from the bench. The 74-year-old jurist kept a stony countenance throughout the trial, even as heated and emotional testimony unfolded from the witness stand next to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, an acquittal will not spell the end of Oliver's legal troubles. Bell's widow, Nicole Paultre-Bell, along with Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, the other two men injured in the shooting, have filed a $50 million civil lawsuit against the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dead man's father, William Bell, who was with his son hours before he was shot, has also pledged to press federal prosecutors to try the case as a civil rights matter if the verdict comes back not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While legal experts expect the Bell family to win a monetary settlement, some doubt the federal government would take up a new criminal complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure that the feds would invest the capital if they're acquitted,&quot; said Adina Schwartz, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. She noted that federal prosecutors tend to be more conservative about the cases they take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very least, Oliver's law enforcement career, along with the others involved in the case, would be diminished, if not done, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would think their careers are in serious jeopardy, regardless of the finding,&quot; Passaic County Prosecutor James Avigliano said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and members of his family have so far declined to speak to the media about the trial. Oliver also did not take the witness stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the shooting, Bell's parents have slammed Oliver, saying he has shown no remorse as the trial proceeded. His grand jury testimony, which was read out loud during the trial, was also described as &quot;defiant&quot; at times. But there was also a moment of regret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the last thing in the world I ever wanted to do,&quot; he told the grand jury that indicted him, &quot;to kill someone or to hurt someone in their family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to live with that also for the rest of my life,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zlotkowski, the officer's friend, said he spoke with Oliver on a recent Sunday, when the two saw each other at Van Houten Lanes, a Clifton bowling alley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Oliver did not seem to be weighed down by the pending verdict. But when Zlotkowski wished him the best, the words Oliver spoke in response were tinged with resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What am I going to do?&quot; Zlotkowski said Oliver told him. &quot;I'm going to have to live with whatever happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This you can pretty much take to the bank: By late Friday morning, at least one side in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case will say that the criminal justice system doesn't work. The criminal justice system never seems to work in the eyes of those who do not get the courtroom verdict that they want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Throughout this case, neither side has shown great confidence in the system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three detectives charged in the 50-shot fusillade that killed  Mr. Bell in Queens 17 months ago tried to have the case moved elsewhere. They relied on a flimsy claim that a borough of 2.3 million people was somehow incapable of producing 12 fair-minded jurors. When that gambit didn't work, they rolled the dice with a Queens judge, Justice Arthur J. Cooperman of State Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the other side, supporters of Mr. Bell's family and friends have made clear their suspicion of a system that routinely absolves police officers when they shoot men -- almost invariably black men, like Mr. Bell -- who turn out to have been unarmed. Anything less than a guilty verdict, they say, would mock justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will find out soon enough what Justice Cooperman thinks. By the time you read this, he may have already announced his verdict, expected around 9 a.m. on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He may acquit the detectives of all charges. That would most likely prompt the Bell side to say the system didn't work. Or the judge may find them guilty on all counts: manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment for Michael Oliver and Gescard F. Isnora, and reckless endangerment for Marc Cooper. Then police officers would be talking about a systemic failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is another possibility. Justice Cooperman may split the difference. He could decide that the detectives had reason to believe they were in danger, enough to justify drawing their guns, but then fired so wantonly as to amount to reckless endangerment on the part of them all. That charge is a misdemeanor carrying a maximum one-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If that is indeed the result, both sides would have an opportunity to criticize the system. The detectives would probably appeal. The Bell family, already suing the city for millions of dollars, might seek federal charges, and the Police Department might start its own disciplinary action. One way or another, this sad matter will linger in the New York consciousness for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And New Yorkers are bound to have their own verdict. The betting here is that many, maybe most, would go for a split-the-difference approach. It lies somewhere between the chants of political radicals that the police wage war on African-Americans and the assertions of knee-jerk police defenders that cops can do no wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is hard to imagine that most New Yorkers believe the detectives set out to shoot Mr. Bell and the men who were with him that night in November 2006. Except in cases of extreme misconduct, there seems to be a broad consensus that the police deserve to be cut some slack because they are often called on to make life-and-death decisions in fractions of a second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the other hand, those same New Yorkers may sense that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg got it right soon after the shootings when he said that it seemed ''excessive force'' had been used and that ''it's hard to understand why 50-odd shots should be taken.'' Those bullets flew every which way; one stray hit an AirTrain terminal nearly the length of a football field away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even while recognizing a possible fear factor and a firepower that enables 50 rounds to be squeezed off within seconds, people have every reason to expect maximum restraint and sound judgment from their police officers. Many cannot begin to understand how so many shots could have been fired without a pause to reassess the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More often than not, the public has a built-in detector on whether the police performed reasonably or not. The absence of mass protests in the Bell case akin to those that followed the police killing of Amadou Diallo in 1999 suggests that these detectives have gotten the benefit of the public doubt. But it doesn't mean that doubt about them and their dismal performance has vanished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A prosecutor, Charles A. Testagrossa, may have come as close as anyone to capturing the public mood. In his closing arguments to the judge 11 days  ago, he said that most people viewed the Bell case ''through the prism of their own prejudices'' -- seeing detectives as either ''tragic heroes'' or ''murderers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The truth,'' Mr. Testagrossa said, ''lies somewhere between the polar extremes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It usually does.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventeen months to the day since two bullets from a swarm of 50 fired by the police killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the verdict in the case against three detectives arrives about 9 a.m. on Friday, with the judge's decision sure to set off an outcry no matter what it is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is rare to know far in advance the exact date and time of a courtroom verdict, but the timing of this one was announced on April 14 by Justice Arthur J. Cooperman of State Supreme Court, who heard testimony in the case over seven weeks without a jury. Some lawyers not involved in the case said the detectives' decision to waive a jury trial was a risky legal strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge gave himself almost two weeks to render a verdict, and the wait has promised to bring beyond-capacity turnout to the courtroom in Queens where the case was heard. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some see the case as far-reaching in its possible ramifications on the conduct of the city's police officers during undercover operations or in those moments when they must decide whether to shoot at a suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the courtroom and around the city, the police have tried to anticipate  any type of reaction to the verdict, an effort that has been done more out of municipal habit than as a response to any direct threat of unrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are prepared for any contingency,'' said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that nothing short of manslaughter convictions would  bring justice. He said Mr. Bell had no idea that the first officer to fire, Detective Gescard F. Isnora, was a police officer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If I'm 4  o'clock in the morning in a car and a man came up and said, 'Police!' I would embrace him and say, 'Thank God, I thought you were a carjacker.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell's supporters say that the case is another in a line of police shootings of unarmed black men that have occurred in recent years, and is emblematic of a pattern of abuse of police power in the black community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two of the officers charged in the Bell case, Detective Isnora and Detective Marc Cooper, are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case may offer the judge the possibility of what in legal circles is sometimes called ''splitting the baby,'' named for King Solomon's proposed solution to the case of two women who claimed  to be the same child's mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a criminal trial, splitting the baby is to find the defendant a little bit guilty and a little bit innocent, which tends to please the interests of neither the victim nor the accused. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the verdict in the Bell shooting, the baby is an eight-count indictment against three detectives, and there are plenty of places for Solomon to cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Nov. 25, 2006, after leaving his bachelor party  at the Club Kalua in Jamaica, Queens, Mr. Bell tried to go back inside to retrieve a  hat and  was confronted by a stranger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora and others were working at the club in an undercover operation, and Detective Isnora said that  during the exchange that followed, he heard Joseph Guzman, a friend of Mr. Bell's, say, ''Get my gun.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora followed Mr. Bell, Mr. Guzman and another friend, Trent Benefield, to Mr. Bell's car, where he said he showed his police badge, clipped to his collar, and shouted, ''Police! Don't move!'' Mr. Bell drove his Nissan Altima into Detective Isnora's leg and into an unmarked minivan driven by Detective Michael Oliver. Mr. Bell backed up and hit a gate, and then hit the minivan again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officers opened fire -- with Detective Oliver firing 31 shots -- killing Mr. Bell and wounding his friends. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Convicting Detectives Isnora, Oliver and Cooper of the least serious charge of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor, would be a compromise verdict, lawyers who have watched the case have said. So would acquitting one or more detectives and convicting the third on some charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora, who fired first, and Detective Oliver, who fired by far the most, are charged with first-and second-degree manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Counts three, four and five in the case relate to the two men wounded, Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield, and the last counts are based on errant bullets that broke  windows but were deemed by a grand jury last year to be cause for charges of recklessness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Cooper is charged with two counts of reckless endangerment, one for putting a bullet through a  window at  an AirTrain platform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the array of charges, this case differs from one  with which it is often compared, that of the four officers charged in the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant killed in a blast of 41 shots as he reached for his wallet. Those officers were charged with second-degree murder, a more serious charge than manslaughter, and reckless endangerment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, as is often the case in criminal trials, jurors in the Diallo case were instructed by the judge to consider lesser charges against the officers if they found them not guilty of murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those lesser charges included manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The jury acquitted the officers on all charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Bell case, Justice Cooperman cannot consider the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide because neither side requested that he do so, lawyers  have said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The defense must be advised, before closing arguments begin, that lesser charges will be included in the deliberations, so that lawyers can properly prepare their final remarks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Justice Cooperman has more charges to consider than the Diallo jurors did, simply because more people were shot in the Bell case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Oliver was charged with first-degree assault in the shootings of Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora faces the same charge in the shooting of Mr. Guzman, but a lesser charge of second-degree assault in the shooting of Mr. Benefield, as none of his bullets appear to have struck him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In grand jury testimony, all of the detectives said that at no point had they aimed their fire at Mr. Bell. The defense has argued that if the officers were justified in taking the first shots at Mr. Guzman, who Detective Isnora said he feared was reaching for a gun, then all the bullets that followed were also justified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By that logic, if Justice Cooperman acquits the detectives on the manslaughter charges, it would be inconsistent to turn around and convict them for assault, or even reckless endangerment, the argument goes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A possible exception, and a baby-splitting outcome that some see as a possibility, is the conviction of Detective Oliver alone. The judge could find that a reasonable person would not fire 31 shots without at some point pausing to reassess whether he or a fellow officer was still at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Oliver told a grand jury he did not know he had fired 16 rounds when he reloaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would only seem like a second or two,'' he said. ''I looked at my gun. I didn't know if it had any bullets or something was wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The differences in sentences for the crimes are significant. First-degree manslaughter carries an automatic minimum prison sentence of 5 years and a maximum of 25. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Second-degree manslaughter generally brings a sentence  as low as one to 3 years and as high as 5 to 15. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First-degree assault brings 5 to 25 years; second-degree assault, generally 2 to 7 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reckless endangerment, the misdemeanor, is punishable by up to one year in prison, or with simple probation and no prison time. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 74-year-old judge known for his no-nonsense approach will deliver one of the most important bench-trial verdicts in the city's history today.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, slated to render his decision in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trial, once threatened to eject a rape victim from his courtroom for crying too loudly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he must decide the fate of three detectives accused in the slaying of Bell, who was shot in a hail of 50 bullets on Nov. 25, 2006, in Jamaica.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora face up to 25 years in the slammer for manslaughter. Marc Cooper is charged with reckless endangerment and faces up to a year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooperman is no stranger to cop trials.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1986, he presided over the trial of NYPD Sgt. Richard Pike and Officer Jeffrey Gilbert, convicted of torturing two teens with stun guns.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied a request to throw out the jury's verdict, calling it an &quot;affront&quot; to &quot;honest and honorable police officers.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever today's verdict, Bell supporters have promised peace.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us be the purveyors of peace so the oppressors will not rob of us our most vital resource, our young people,&quot; Father Darryl James said last night at Community Church of Christ, where the groom-to-be's funeral had been held.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Kalua strip club, where Bell, 23, had been celebrating his bachelor party, planned to shut down today if the cops go free. &quot;The boss is worried that people will bum rush the place,&quot; a bouncer told The Post.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court officials said other cases would be postponed until after the verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, had her hair done yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She just wants justice,&quot; said her stylist, Ayanna Dossantos, 28, &quot;She's not the same, happy person she used to be.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell supporters yesterday said they expected the community to react peacefully no matter the verdict today - but the NYPD, state court officials and the club at the center of it all prepared for the worst. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said cops were &quot;hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst&quot; as they pulled in resources from around the city to focus on the area around the courthouse and the Jamaica site where Bell, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman were shot. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters after a press conference in Jamaica, Comrie said the Police Department should &quot;remove the lieutenant, the commanding officer, the head of the division. They all need to be, I think, fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comrie's reaction is notable politically because his likely opponent in the Queens borough president race next year, Councilman Peter Vallone Jr., came to the defense of the Police Department today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a tragedy for everyone. No verdict would bring back the life of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and heal the pain of his family.Officers have a very difficult job, and in this instance something went terribly wrong. But the court has decided that these officers are not criminals,&quot; Vallone said. &quot;We have already begun to learn from this tragedy and improve. My Public Safety Committee has already had three hearings-on undercover training, police monitoring, and community policing-and we have one on stop and frisk policy to come. The important thing now is to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, spoke with reporters briefly outside the Queens court house just now.  He said, &quot;With this case, there are no winners, there's no losers. We still have a death that occurred. We still have police officers that have to live with the fact that there was a death involved in their case. But nonetheless, this sends a message to New York City police officers that when you are in that position , when you are in front of a courthouse, when you are in front of that court bench, that you will get fairness. And that is what New York City police officers need each and every day. Every time a police officer goes on the street, there is never a script. We have to deal with circumstances as they come. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;Nonetheless, we are grateful for this outcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE II: In ivering his verdict, Judge Arthur Cooperman said, &quot;Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE III: Michael Bloomberg released the following statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no winners in a trial like this.  An innocent man lost his life, a bride lost her groom, two daughters lost their father, and a mother and a father lost their son.  No verdict could ever end the grief that those who knew and loved </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suffer.  Judge Cooperman's responsibility, however, was to decide the case based on the evidence presented in the courtroom.  America is a nation of laws, and though not everyone will agree with the verdicts and opinions issued by the courts, we accept their authority.  Today's decision is no different.  There will be opportunities for peaceful dissent and potentially for further legal recourse - those are the rights we enjoy in a democratic nation. We don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it. We have come too far as society - and as a City - to be dragged back to those days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I spoke with Nicole Paultre Bell on the steps of City Hall this week, I told her that while we can't bring back the man that she was in love with, we can and will build and make things better.  She replied 'Yes, and make sure it doesn't happen again,' and I agreed, 'Yes, that's exactly what we have to do.'  All of us have a responsibility to improve our neighborhoods and our City, and we can only do that by working together, respecting each other, and doing everything possible to prevent future tragedies and injustices.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN Air Commodore </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw the squalid conditions hundreds of Afghan orphans were living in, he knew he had to do something to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boys and girls in Tai Masken and Alludhoddin orphanages in Kabul don't have running water, have to switch on lights by connecting two bare wires and during the freezing winter are forced to burn their own furniture to keep warm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former RAF Cottesmore station commander, based in Kabul since September, launched into action and has set up a charity called Ringing The Changes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in just a few months, with the help of RAF Cottesmore personnel and his team in Kabul, they have already raised &pound;12,000 thanks also to the support of the local community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cash has been generated by a garment made in Afghanistan - pashminas. Sean and his team have been buying the pashminas in the markets of Kandahar from three local sellers for a few dollars each. They are bringing them home where volunteers are selling them for &pound;5 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at home in North Luffenham on a few days of leave this week, the father-of-two said: &quot;We watched the Americans giving aid, such as sweets and thought, great, until we looked at the orphanage and then you consider these children never clean their teeth. What good are you doing giving them sweets?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was looking for something during my nine-month tour to provide my team with an opportunity to make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;We took a group of military personnel to visit Alluhoddin and they were in tears at the state of them. Yet compared to Tai Masken that is the good one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 450 boys aged five to 17 at Tai Masken and 200 children, mainly girls aged five to 17, at Alludhoddin, although there are a few boys under the age of five there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Tai Masken there are bare wires on the wall so the children join together to turn on the lights. They have no running water, no toilets and they haven't bathed or washed for months. The building has no heating and this winter the temperature fell to minus 26C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children eat mainly rice and have meat once a week. The raw meat is chopped up on the filthy floor, with cats nearby. It is so cold in the winter that wood is removed from beds to be used as fuel to put on a fire to keep them warm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are about 8,000 orphans in Afganistan. Many have lost their fathers in various conflicts. Life expectancy in the country is about 40 and the average wage is about &pound;30 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response to the pashminas has been truly astonishing. Although only sold at coffee mornings, in churches, at Ashwell Prison and one golf and a fitness club, about &pound;12,000 has been raised. The volunteers have sold a total of 3,500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean, who is director of operations in the headquarters of the International Stability and Assistance Force, is aiming to raise &pound;40,000 to help the orphanages which would pay to improve the electrical wiring and plumbing to provide running water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the charity's first target and future goals include sending supplies to the children, improving training for the staff looking after them and encouraging personnel to spend time with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money raised so far means work can begin next month to improve the electrics but more money is urgently required. Anyone who would like to sell pashminas or offer help should e-mail ringingthe</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter which one of the three presidential candidates wins now, the Republicans lose, because the one they really wanted in there was Giuliani and he had no values, or had no values. So McCain may possibly be the winner, but the Republicans lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just wanted to say &quot;thank you&quot; for moving the crossword above the fold and for enlarging it. Finally, someone who understood those holes at the bottom of the page made the crossword more difficult to do. Thank you again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the callers to this column prefers Hillary, who reputedly has temper tantrums and throws dishes in the White House, to John McCain, whom she calls a warmonger for dropping bombs.

It's a rather skewed view to refer to this as a temper tantrum, since he did this under the orders of his commander in chief, Democrat President Lyndon Baines Johnson, for which McCain spent five-and-a-half years in the Hanoi Hilton. But perhaps if Hillary was throwing dishes at Bill   and I recall he did some things in the White House which may have brought on her tantrum   this could mean she can at least recognize the face of the enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm calling about the article in Sunday's, April 27, issue of the Sun-News. How in the world did somebody get a big headline that says, &quot;Do&ntilde;a Ana gets new community center,&quot; when in fact it was Organ. It's not Do&ntilde;a Ana! Is the newspaper going to print a retraction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your comments on what's going on at Gadsden Middle School, a couple of questions: Where is the union on this issue? Why are the teachers still working? Why don't you just stick together and walk off? And where are the parents? Why aren't the parents doing something if their kids are in danger? All these calls to the Sound Off! make no sense if nothing's getting done. Why don't you people show some backbone and do something yourself, the teachers and the parents? Do something drastic to get the attention of the public and the superintendent and the school board. Otherwise, stop whining!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a paper-saving suggestion. Since you (print) the Sunday crossword puzzle so small that's it's illegible, why don't you just eliminate it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody's worried about gas prices, the economy, all of that. Well, you know, Americans can make small changes that really save them money and benefit them. Number one, stop buying Cokes, potato chips, all the junk food, cookies. Start eating more at home, making your meals from scratch. There are so many things you can do. This panic over $3 gas, $4 gas, you guys better learn to deal with it, because it ain't going any lower. In Europe, they pay $8 a gallon. Think about it! There are lots of ways in your life that you can save money, live better and benefit the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comment is for Police Chief Harry Romero. You need to tell your Codes officers that they're not police officers. They're leaving themselves wide open for a lawsuit. They cannot go around touching people or pushing people around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think Richardson is down in Venezuela making some deal with Chavez to broker a deal to rescue the people held hostage there to make himself look good so somebody will select him as vice president. He says he's acting as a private citizen, not as a representative of our government, so what could he possibly offer Chavez? Maybe some favor in the future if he does become vice president? This whole thing sounds fishy to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a barking dog that barks and wakes me up every morning at 4 o'clock in the morning once they let the dog out of the house. I've talked to Codes, and they said they couldn't do nothing about it because I would have to get three witnesses, and they couldn't put muzzles on a dog. They talked to the people, but they couldn't do nothing about it. Can you guys give me an answer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope all these people that are getting rebate checks this year realize that it's coming out of their taxes next year, so you're not really getting anything for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would not surprise me if we learned someday that Hillary Clinton is staying in the presidential race in order to collect more money. I've heard she spends other people's money lavishly, but is a miser with her own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have serious doubts that any Las Cruces Police Department officer would try to arrest a man for calling a woman a &quot;bitch&quot; in a parking lot. I imagine that he probably got out of his vehicle and started an altercation. He still couldn't be arrested if he didn't touch the woman, but I'm sure he probably got in the cop's face. Otherwise, they wouldn't have reacted to that because they would know that it would put them into a lawsuit situation. So, I'm sure the guy was aggravating the situation and causing much more of a problem than your article would lead us to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have any of you people who coughed your way through the Sunday (April 27) performance of &quot;CATS&quot; ever heard of throat lozenges?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you watched KFOX News at 9 on Sunday (April 27), you would understand why the developers around here are still trying to get people to buy these houses with offers like &quot;$250 gets you in this home today.&quot; They're having a hard time paying their mortgages on the lots that they want to build on, so now they're just anxious to sell anything that's completed so they can get some capital so they can pay for their other lots that they want to develop, because no one wants to buy these lots from them now. So those people that think there's nothing wrong with the housing market here, think again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that somebody doesn't really know New York or those of us who are from New York very well. Those police officers that were acquitted in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case, that's only the tip of the iceberg. There are more court cases to come, there is a Citizens Review Board in New York. They may have been acquitted on this first round, but that was only because of conflicting testimony from witnesses. The judge had no choice in this case. However, the future cases that are coming up against them, they're not going to win. So they will be brought to task for what they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recycling is very important for the environment. I don't think it would be very hard for our city fathers to put up a couple more bins at local sites so people can recycle plastics and office paper without driving all the way over on Amador to the city recycling drop-off place. And how about glass? We need to recycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, we're not worth new Sound Off!s again. Great way to start off the week. Thanks a lot, Sun-News, we just get a bunch of repeats again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of people shop at Save Mart Foods at Valley Drive. The new bus route stops on the other side of the street from Save Mart now. Not only is this a safety hazard, but it's unfair to one of our fine, local merchants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a question for Walt Rubel and all the other muckrakers who continue to blather on about New Mexico State. In the first place, the pornography issue should have been taken care of promptly, but in the second place, why haven't the two fired professors decided to file litigation against the university? Have you thought about that? I suspect it's because they don't want anybody to know why they were released, and the university is not obligated   unless they would have to go to court   to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday (April 26) evening, my wife and me dined at our favorite restaurant. We didn't have to make reservations. In fact, we didn't even have to wait for a table. The Republican's high price of gasoline is now taking its toll on our local businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm calling about the newspaper today. You can't even read the newspaper. They ruined it, and the classifieds are so small nobody could read that. Please, put the paper back like it was or reduce the price of the paper to match the price of the print, and we'll get the paper for free!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course Bill McCamley wants to support shooting off fireworks. That way everyone can celebrate the tax increases he wants to give us. Way to go!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any person who would kill a 5-week-old baby, or for that matter any child, needs to be put to death   nothing more, nothing less   because they've lost their right to live in a civilized society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to me that children are being abused in Texas, but not by their mothers, by the Texas Department of Family and Children Services, and a frightening judge named Barbara Walther. There are many ugly and frightening things about Texas politics. She is an elected judge. We see completely that this system of finding judges must be stopped. Small children   no charges have been made that they're being abused by their parents. Why are they being removed? They'll be scarred for life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was a kid growing up, we always had big firecrackers and played with them and stuff like that. But when I was in the service in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, us young boys was playing with firecrackers around a drive-in theater on a holiday, and one of them throwed a firecracker at a girl and it hit her right in the face and blowed her eye out. I haven't wanted a firecracker around me since, and I don't believe they should be sold in this town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corn is not the only source for ethanol and biofuels. Ethanol can be made, it has been discovered, from landfill material and many other sources. The reason why they're focusing on corn, I believe it's the oil companies! They want people to be against ethanol because it's raising food prices, so they're trying to convince people that corn is the only source and that we need to use all the corn for ethanol, thus raising all the prices, when in truth we don't even need the corn for ethanol production. The oil companies are just trying to put another one over on us and bamboozle us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to thank the person that found my payment for Home Depot and took it to the store for me. Thank you, Lord. Amen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll bet there are two people in the whole staff there who could satisfactorily define a carbon footprint, and yet you use this ambiguous phrase to justify cutting down on the size of the newspaper. I have a better idea: Drop down to 4-point type, publish once a week and make it about magazine size, about the size of the Reader's Digest. That would reduce your carbon footprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever happened to the noise pollution laws in Las Cruces? Talk about sirens...why are they so loud? Why can't you just tone them down a bit? This isn't a big city, this is a small town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have DirecTV and late Friday (April 25) afternoon, quite late Friday afternoon, I called up DirecTV customer service because I needed a new remote. Mine wasn't working as well as it should. By 11 o'clock this morning, Monday (April 28) morning, FedEx had already delivered my new remote, completely free of any charge to me. I was just wondering if you Comcast customers can say the same about Comcast service?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am so tired of people saying that if you don't support the ideology of the current administration you are unpatriotic, if you don't support the war in Iraq you are unpatriotic, and there are many other similar examples. I ask you, is it patriotic to support that which is detrimental to the United States? Isn't true patriotism a desire to do what is best for the country? I agree wholeheartedly with Thomas Jefferson, who said, &quot;Dissension is the greatest form of patriotism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's so wonderful what the mayors are doing for the Red Cross. With the popularity and character of mayors like Michael Cadena of Mesilla, they should sell well over 900 tickets. Thanks for caring about the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your online poll asks if we should build the border fence. I say we shouldn't only build a border fence, we should electrify it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding your new format and microscopic type font, my subscription check will be reduced in size proportionately to your type font until we decide to just cancel altogether, because this really sucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is concerning everyone who is complaining in the neighborhood of Country Club Circle about people running businesses out of their homes. Do they have nothing else to do than complain about something that is not true? There's no businesses being run. All it is is somebody that wants to complain and has nothing else better to do with their time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is another one about the illegals. They are working in the schools, teaching your kids. As long as they can speak good English, they automatically are hired, and the same way with the ones getting welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Teague is trying to buy the CD 2 election. Today, he just wrote himself a check for $475,000, but he won't even agree to debate Bill McCamley even once in this coming month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, I got it. In real life, the gross receipts taxes and growth is the only thing that pays government's checks and the revenue's important for the city to continue all of its services. So now they're going to approve all of the subdivisions and they're just going to call them &quot;green&quot; subdivisions. So now that the annexation and the subdivisions and the zoning is called &quot;green&quot; subdivisions, &quot;green&quot; annexations and &quot;green&quot; zoning, everything will be passed and everybody will be happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem with this epidemic diabetes is the number of miscarriages and birth defects for women with this disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hate to see a good kid like Miley Cyrus turned into a sleazy vamp by her advisors, parents or whoever. Do all kids have to be pimps and whores nowadays? Satan is ruling the planet, folks, and it isn't getting any better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Education as a cabinet-level department that shouldn't even exist on the federal level, that's an idea that I could not more wholeheartedly agree with, because I believe there is a correlation between federal meddling in education and the degradation of it to the point that the people cannot even recognize Obama and most of his party for the socialists they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LC Sun-News could save paper if they would stop delivering the daily paper which we canceled nearly three weeks ago!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for the two wonderful articles by area residents, Michael Hayes and Thomas Wark. I like reasoned, intelligent writing. The world needs more of it, and I'm glad to know there's some of it right here. It gives me hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I certainly did notice several things different in today's newspaper. Didn't much care for them. The SU/DO/KU and the Cryptoquip are large enough that a legally blind person could read them. The Bridge column was so small that a magnifying glass was needed to read it. My suggestion is that you put smaller pictures of sports events in the paper and there would be room for bigger print where needed. I would also like to suggest that the news of sporting events be put in the Sports section where they belong and not on the front page. You have not improved our newspaper in the least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the April 20 edition of the Sun-News, County Commissioner Bill McCamley wrote the county is losing $90,000 in GRT revenue every year without year-round fireworks sales. At the current county GRT rate (.9375 percent), it would take fireworks sales of $9.6 million to generate $90,000 of county GRT revenue. This means the fireworks vendors would be selling over $26,000 worth of fireworks every day, seven days a week for 365 days. I don't believe it and think McCamley is deceiving the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't believe that Steve Pearce thinks we are going to elect him to the Senate after he spent his time in Congress supporting Cheney and Big Oil at every turn and on every vote. He was even stronger then Bush in his denial that global warming existed. No Steve, even with oil the lobbyists filling your campaign chest, we won't let it happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city does not need to charge any extra fees, just audit the Bantam Weight Sports program and hold them responsible for all the money they collect every year for registration and operating the concession stands. They collect a lot of money and are not held accountable for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas prices only spiked, oil prices only spiked when the Democrats took over Congress in 2007. How about that folks? It's a world economy. There are millions of new drivers in India and China. Guess what? They want to be like us Americans. Everybody envies our lifestyles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You all have published a lot of negative stuff about Harry Teague. Please publish the following comment: Someone recently wrote Harry Teague did not give Al Kissling money. Look at the FEC reports. On April 21, 2006, a check was cashed for $250. On top of that, FEC reports show Harry Teague has given over $50,000 to Democrats in the past seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the American population gets older, many publishers are beginning to use a larger print in their publications to offset failing eyesight. What does the Sun-News do? Shrink the typeset which they use. This is almost as bad a decision as when you endorsed George Bush for President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexico's driver's licenses may be more secure from identity thieves but, it is useless as identification for anything else. Why? Because New Mexico gives driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, and so, like New York, less and less places are going to accept them as a valid form of identification, i.e. for airline flights etc. And oh, by the way, many illegals are being arrested by the Border Patrol at local checkpoints because they are traveling to New Mexico from all over the country to get driver's licenses here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonard Pitts Miami Herald</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION; Columnists</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">635 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want you to tell me how I can trust the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Attorney General, the question is for you. And you too, Ms. Police Officer, Madame District Attorney, and Mr. Judge. It is also for you, Mr. and Ms. Average Citizen. I realize this will be an engraved invitation for those crackpots who get their jollies flouting their hatefulness and ignorance on electronic message boards and I'm willing to live with that because the question, I assure you, is in earnest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody tell me: How can I trust the justice system? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will think this is about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the unarmed black man who died in a fusillade of 50 bullets from New York police on what was to have been his wedding day; the shooters were acquitted last week. But the question isn't about Bell, at least not solely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, it's about the fact that the justice system so often seems to have less justice in it where black people are concerned. It's about Amadou Diallo, shot at 41 times - hit 19 - by New York police while reaching for his wallet. It's about Rodney King, beaten to pieces by L.A. police for a traffic violation. It's about Arthur McDuffie, beaten to ''death'' by Miami police for a traffic violation. It's about Jeffrey Gilbert, bones fractured by police who broke into the Greenbelt, Md., apartment of his girlfriend and pounced on him as he lay nude in bed because they mistakenly thought him a cop killer. It's about L.A. police manufacturing and planting evidence. It's about my son, stopped by police for driving with an ''obstructed'' windshield - he had an air freshener in the shape of a Christmas tree dangling from his rear-view mirror. It's about studies documenting the enduring racial bias in our justice system so that, for example, blacks account for 13 percent of all regular drug users, but 35 percent of those arrested, 55 percent of those convicted, and 74 percent of those imprisoned, for drug possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's about knowing the foregoing will be greeted with blithe indifference by those who find it convenient to believe the unjust treatment of blacks is somehow excusable, understandable, merited or required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I need no lectures to remind me that good people inhabit the system; my cousin is a federal prosecutor. Nor do I need any lectures on the heroism of cops; I've ridden with police, been protected by them, and yield to no one in my admiration for those who do that job with honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So save the lectures, just give me an answer: How can I trust a system whose biases against people who look like me are simultaneously well-documented, yet happily ignored by those who resemble me not at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question matters because without trust, the system doesn't work. Everybody came down, and justifiably so, on the idiot rapper who said last year that he would not call police even if a serial killer were living next door. Unfortunately, fewer people bothered to ask where such profound distrust comes from. Fewer still bothered to ask what it leads to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People don't participate in systems they don't trust. They don't come forward, they don't testify. So criminals go uncaptured and crimes, unpunished. Yet some black people apparently find that preferable to participating in a system they believe is rigged against them. I don't agree with them, but before you condemn them, ask yourself: Would you play in a game refereed by someone who hated you? What's the point?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In games as in life, you may not like an outcome, but if you believe it was fairly derived, you can at least live with it. Small wonder black people often find it difficult to live with this system. Last week's acquittal will do nothing to change that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I'm serious. Somebody tell me how I can trust American justice. Somebody tell me why I should even try.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE New York City detectives were found not guilty yesterday in the shooting death of an unarmed black man killed in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day, prompting angry reactions and a federal review of the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York state judge cleared two police officers of manslaughter and other charges and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23. Bell was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in November 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But federal authorities said they would consider civil rights charges in a review of the case to be conducted by the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will &quot;take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes&quot;, the Justice Department said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, hundreds of demonstrators, some carrying placards reading &quot;Jail Racist Killer Cops&quot;, marched on the courthouse. There was pushing and shoving in the crowd as police, reporters and spectators packed the footpath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, who has been highly critical of police and is influential in New York's black community, called for wider protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want us to act crazy so they would have an excuse to do more,&quot; Mr Sharpton told listeners of his radio show. &quot;[But] we are going to close the city down in a non-violent, effective way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for calm after the verdict, saying: &quot;We don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has outraged New York's black community, but police said they did not expect violence because previous demonstrations against the perceived police brutality had been peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows that there is no justice in America for the black man. This is telling us the cops can do whatever they want and get away with it,&quot; said B.M. Marcus, a community organiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers gave brief statements thanking their friends and family. &quot;I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,&quot; said Detective Marc Cooper, who had been charged with reckless endangerment. The other detectives, Gescard Isnora and Michael Oliver, had been charged with manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants chose to have the judge, rather than a jury, decide their guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers said jurors in the borough of Queens were likely to be biased against the detectives due to intense media coverage of the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: Three detectives were found not guilty in the shooting death of an unarmed black man, killed in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day -- prompting angry reactions yesterday and a federal review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York state judge cleared two policemen of manslaughter and other charges and a third of reckless endangerment in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23. Mr Bell was shot, along with two friends, after a bachelor party at a strip club in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal authorities said they would consider civil rights charges, after a review by the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will ``take appropriate action, if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes,'' a departmental statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, hundreds of demonstrators yelled angrily, amid pushing and shoving in the crowd as police, reporters and spectators packed the footpath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton, who has been highly critical of police, called for wider protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``They want us to act crazy, so they would have an excuse to do more,'' Sharpton told his radio audience. ``We are going to be strategic. We are going to close the city down in a non-violent way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for calm, saying: ``We don't expect violence or law-breaking, nor is there any place for it''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case generated outrage in New York's black community, but police said they did not expect violence because numerous demonstrations against the perceived police brutality had been peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It shows that there is no justice in America for the black man. This is telling us the cops can do whatever they want and get away with it,'' said B.M.Marcus, a community organiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquitted officers thanked their friends and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'd like to say sorry to the Bell family for the tragedy,'' said detective Marc Cooper, acquitted of a reckless endangerment charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other detectives, Gescard Isnora and Mike Oliver, were charged with manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three men waived their right to a jury and opted to have a judge decide guilt or innocence. Defence lawyers said local jurors were likely to be biased against the police, with heavy media coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court Judge Arthur Cooperman said the charges could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt, after some witnesses changed their testimony and may have had motivation to lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge accepted the police felt in danger, adding: ``Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the fateful night, Isnora followed Bell and friends to a car, believing they went to get a gun to resolve a row. He fired after being grazed as Bell drove off. The other two said they believed Isnora was being fired at from inside the car.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CIVIL rights leaders demanded a federal investigation and vowed to march through the streets in protest after three police officers were cleared of all charges in the killing of an unarmed black man cut down in a hail of 50 bullets on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict by Justice Arthur Cooperman elicited gasps as well as tears of joy and sorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, wept at the defence table, while the mother of victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cried in the packed courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shouts of ``Murderers! Murderers!'' and ``KKK!'' -- a reference to the Ku Klux Klan -- rang out on the courthouse steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was killed outside a seedy strip club in the New York suburb of Queens in 2006 as he was leaving his bachelor party with two friends. The officers -- undercover detectives who were investigating reports of prostitution at the club -- said they thought one of the men had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slaying heightened tensions in the city and stoked long-standing allegations of racism and excessive use of force on the part of New York City's police, even though two of the officers charged are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing his verdict in the non-jury trial, the judge said the inconsistent testimony, courtroom demeanour and rap sheets of the prosecution witnesses -- mainly Bell's friends -- ``had the effect of eviscerating'' their credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``At times, the testimony just didn't make sense,'' the judge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had assigned extra officers to the courthouse and had helicopters in the air to help deal with any unrest. But within an hour, the angry, weeping crowd of about 200 people outside the courthouse had scattered, and despite a few scuffles, no arrests were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and Gescard Isnora were acquitted of charges that included manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment. The third officer, Marc Cooper, faced lesser charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict does not entirely resolve issues surrounding the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US attorney's office said it would look into the case and ``take appropriate action if the evidence indicates a prosecutable violation of federal criminal civil rights statutes''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, relatives of the victims have sued the city, and those cases could either go to trial or be settled out of court with the potential for multimillion-dollar payouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the officers still face possible departmental charges that could result in their firing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd was up by about 40,000 on last year and the number of marchers by 1000 -- and their spirits were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">higher than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``It's very emotional. The blokes really appreciate the people standing on the sidelines and cheering them on,'' Mr Munkman's daughter Beryl Dodds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pushed her father's wheelchair for the first time yesterday and admitted to a few tears during the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I had a little cry ... everyone came together as one to support those who served their country,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Mr Munkman said he had ``quite enjoyed'' the occasion, which saw him high-fiving the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the family and friends of the 645 sailors who perished on HMAS Sydney in 1941, yesterday's march was particularly emotional, coming just a month after the wreck was finally located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I was only nine years old when my Uncle Leonard was killed in action,'' 76-year-old Grace Russell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I remember I came home from school and my father was crying in the bedroom. He'd just received a telegram from the War Department.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whose grandfather David Shepherd died when the ship was sunk, made the journey from Perth to represent his family: ``None of us fought for our country but we know how to honour those who did,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar sentiments were voiced at the dawn service at Martin Place hours earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A record attendance, estimated at 35,000, became a rainbow vista of umbrellas, hats and anything from bin liners to plastic coats worn to deflect the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land Commander of Australia Maj-Gen Mark Kelly told the crowd that the word ``Anzac'' referred to more than a military campaign: ``It has transcended the physical meaning to become a spirit, an inspiration which embodies courage, discipline, sacrifice, self-reliance and, in Australian terms, mateship and a fair go,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the state, Dawn Services were held in numerous regional centres, including Newcastle, Bathurst, Lithgow and Albury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Gosford, 88-year-old former bomber pilot John Leeuwin-Clark said it was gratifying so many had braved the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We all have stories and this is a nice time of year to think back on your old friends,'' said Mr Leeuwin-Clark, who served in East Africa and the Middle East in World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Sadly a lot of the boys didn't come home. It's important to remember them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman doing just that was Legacy widow Gwen Miller from Liverpool, who attended the Sydney parade alone for the first time since her husband Gordon's death last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She felt he was nonetheless there in spirit: ``He's with me today -- he's always with me. I've got his medals on and I'm wearing his picture in a locket around my neck,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By mid-morning, Narrabeen resident Lisa Smith, 21, had barely any voice left -- the result of cheering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Father of two shot 50 times outside club</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in New York were braced for possible disturbances last night after a judge acquitted three officers who gunned down an unarmed black man on his wedding day in a hail of 50 bullets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred protesters met the verdict with cries of &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; as 1,000 police patrolled the streets around the courthouse in the borough of Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was mown down by a fusillade of police bullets as he left his stag party at the Club Kalhua topless bar on November 25, 2006, just hours before he was to wed his high-school sweetheart. The shots were fired by an squad of five undercover officers who had the club under surveillance for prostitution and drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence said that an officer confronted Mr Bell and his friends after hearing one of the group say: &quot;Go get my gat&quot;, slang for gun. The officers said that they began firing when Mr Bell's Nissan Altima car tried to run over the detective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the plain-clothes men - Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper - were charged with a range of offences from manslaughter to reckless endangerment for firing 46 of the 50 shots. Justice Arthur Cooperman, who heard the two-month trial without a jury at the officers' request, acquitted the three detectives of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court has found that the incident lasted just seconds. The officers responded to perceived criminal conduct; the unfortunate consequences of their conduct were tragic,&quot; the judge ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre-Bell, the victim's fiancee and mother of his two young daughters, walked out of the court as Mr Bell's mother burst into tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, Lorenzo Steele, a former police officer who joined the protest, said: &quot;We never shoot 40-50 times. This was murder, and saying they are not guilty is a shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ray Kelly, the police commissioner said: &quot;Obviously some people who will be disappointed with the verdict. We understand that. We don't anticipate violence but we are prepared for any contingency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case drew comparison with the 1999 shooting of an African immigrant named Amadou Diallo, who was gunned down in a volley of 41 shots by police who mistook his wallet for a gun. The acquittal of the officers in the Diallo case sparked protests that led to hundreds of arrests. The Bell case has not inflamed racial tensions in the same way because two of the accused officers were themselves black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives could still face federal civil rights charges and police disciplinary proceedings. Mr Bell's family have also filed a civil claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE detectives were acquitted of all charges last night in the 50-shot killing of an unarmed groom-to-be on his wedding day, a case that put the NYPD at the centre of another dispute involving allegations of excessive firepower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Arthur Cooperman delivered the verdict in a Queens courtroom packed with spectators, including victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fiancee and parents, as at least 200 people gathered outside the building. As word of the verdict spread, many outside the courthouse began crying and yelled ``No!'' Some briefly jostled with police officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, a 23-year-old black man, was killed in a hail of gunfire outside a seedy strip club in Queens on November 25, 2006 -- his wedding day -- as he was leaving his bachelor party with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover officers, complaining that pre-trial publicity had unfairly painted them as cold-blooded killers, opted to have the judge decide the case rather than a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver, 36, and Gescard Isnora, 29, stood trial for manslaughter while Marc Cooper, 40, was charged only with reckless endangerment. Two other shooters weren't charged. Mr Oliver squeezed off 31 shots; Mr Isnora fired 11 rounds; and Mr Cooper shot four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge said the charges could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. ``Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums,'' Justice Cooperman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conviction on manslaughter could have brought up to 25 years in prison; the penalty for reckless endangerment, a misdemeanour, is a year behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case brought back painful memories of other NYPD shootings, such as the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo -- an African immigrant who was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets by police officers who mistook his wallet for a gun. The acquittal of the officers in that case created a storm of protest, with hundreds arrested after taking to the streets in demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood surrounding this case has been muted by comparison, although Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre-Bell, parents and their supporters, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, have held rallies demanding that the officers -- two of whom are black -- be held accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police prepared for potential unrest with the announcement of the verdict although officials said they did not expect violence because numerous demonstrations against the perceived police brutality had remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight-week trial centred on whether the detectives had reason to believe they faced imminent danger and whether they made it clear to Bell and the two survivors, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, that they were police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of the shooting, Mr Isnora, the undercover officer who fired first, followed Bell and his two friends to Bell's car believing they went to fetch a gun to settle a dispute at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He opened fire after being grazed by the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other officers reached Bell's car after the initial confrontation and said they believed Mr Isnora was being fired at from inside the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence attorneys painted the victims as drunken thugs who the officers believed were armed and dangerous. Prosecutors sought to convince the judge the victims had been minding their own business and that the officers were inept, trigger-happy aggressors. ``This F-Troop of a unit caused the death of an innocent man and caused the injury of two others,'' prosecutor Charles Testagrossa said, referring to the classic TV sitcom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sharpton, who was in court last night, said before the verdict that he had sought to temper outrage over the shooting of three unarmed black men and let the trial take its course. Two of the three officers are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We gave the city an opportunity to show that we would be a new city of fairness,'' Mr Sharpton said earlier this week.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is documented and accepted as fact that it was Carter who got the hostages in Iran released, not Reagan. the only thing that Reagan can get credit for is a sense of good timing, because all of the groundwork that Carter laid came to a head and resulted in their release a couple of days after Reagan took office. He did not sit there wringing his hands, he sat there doing what he was supposed to do, and that was protecting the American people and securing their release from Iran. And if you think someone is a wimp because they believe in a peaceful solution to a problem, then you've got to be a Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, corn is not the only source for any type of alternative fuels, biofuels. For some reason, that's the one that they're concentrating on, but there have been different research projects that have successfully made ethanol and alternative fuels, believe it or not, from recycling materials. So why they're just focusing on corn, I don't know, ask the farmers. As far as there not being enough refineries in America, what are you going to do? Build more refineries to refine something that there's not going to be any more left of in a decade or two? Isn't that a waste of money? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you really, really want to support the man who brought us the spaceport tax, vote for Commissioner McCamley for Congress. I'm sure he'll find some more taxes for ya' if he ever gets to Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fines from New Mexico OSHA are going to be very insignificant compared to the amount of money that the city will settle for the worker who was killed's family. Try and keep this out in the public eye and not let them make a settlement and keep it hidden, because this is in the public interest. The city too often settles these civil suits and keeps the amount of the settlement hidden so the public won't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driving to work today, within the span of just four minutes of my commute, a white EBID pickup blew a stop sign, sped, tailgated, and ran not one, but two red lights before flying into the distance. What gives, driver? Was there an irrigation emergency at 7:45 a.m. that desperately needed your attention? First off, Cruces, get red-light cameras installed everywhere. Second, police, where the heck are you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the things we could do to stop escalating cots for the consumer due to the increase in gas prices, which, of course, raises the costs of delivering these products to stores is we should go back to the old ways of shipping things by train. It's economical, it's better for the environment, in a lot of ways, it's faster. Maybe we should go back to that. Then, we wouldn't need all that gas for all the trucks. We need to change our way of life and or way of looking at things. I know it's not easy, but we have to do it and face facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where was the Sun-News on Thursday, April 24, at 12 noon in front of City Hall where a dedicated group of people had assembled for an anti-Iraq war demonstration? Does the Sun-New take sides against or for the war? A newspaper is supposed to give out the news and show up where our people have an interest. Shame on you, Sun-News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone has a tempter to a certain extent. As far as a temper in the White House, I'd rather have Hillary in the White House maybe throwing a glass or a plate every once in a while than a war monger like John McCain whose response in a temper tantrum would be to drop a bomb on somebody. Big difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looks like Dial-A-Ride is getting a real workout since the RoadRunner bus schedule took effect. Please, don't ruin Dial-A-Ride, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way I learned to save about 5 percent from stores I shop (in) weekly is to check my register receipt with the store's advertised prices. I almost always get cash back. The odds are better than Vegas!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your story on the bus schedule was wrong. If you check the new bus schedule, you'll see the schedule went from 40 minutes to 60 minutes, not 30 minutes, and if you go to the transfer point, you'll see the bus is leaving about 10 minutes late   they run 10 to 20 minutes late every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To all you so-called &quot;neighbors&quot; who keep your dogs outside while they are away at work and forget that your barking dog is invading on the rights of your neighbor and others in your neighborhood that work at different shifts, who forgets to provide food, water and shelter for that nine to 10 hours you are away, you need to find a better way to care for your animals or be turned into Animal Control for the barking nuisance or the animal's neglect. Remember, your neighbor has just as many rights as you, and one of those rights is to be free from nuisances and not have to watch your animal suffer from your reckless neglect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somebody lovingly referred to &quot;wacko Democrats&quot; today. Well, I'll tell you something. I'll take 100 &quot;wacko Democrats&quot; over one power-hungry, arrogant, aggressive, oil-company friendly, patron of the rich, Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the teachers at Gadsden Middle School regarding the health and safety violations, first of all, don't take it. Here's some suggestions: File a class-action lawsuit for violation of safety policy, file a worker's compensation claims and be prepared to be psychologically harassed or lose your job, or three, contact Governor Richardson. Your options are varied, but you've got to take a stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two people in this town that need to be...tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail: Chancellor Martin at New Mexico State University and the editor of this paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reading the Sound Off! and what I've been reading in the Sun-News for the past few days or weeks, today's, Thursday's (April 24) paper, ganging up on Mr. Gallagher, I would like to say that the president of the university should have a sign that says, &quot;The buck stops here.&quot; He has totally done nothing about it, and evidently this has been going on for some time. So, somebody had to know about it, and I think that all these people that are involved should resign their positions, including Martin, the president of the university. He should have done something a long time ago, and he should resign. I don't think the people of Las Cruces have any faith in him anymore   at least I don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just heard that the three cops involved in the New York </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting were let off, all charges dropped. These three men were involved with shooting an unarmed, black man 50 times outside a New York club in 2006 the night before his wedding. Fifty times! And they were only charged with manslaughter and reckless endangerment in the first place, charges that ended up being liquidated, all said? Are you kidding me? I am livid. This is out of control.</SPAN></P>
