<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SIX-woman jury has found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in a racially charged trial that transfixed the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Mr Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict,'' Judge Deborah Nelson said, soon after the decision was read yesterday over the killing in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman smiled when the verdict was read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family grinned broadly as they sat behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury had deliberated for more than 16 hours since Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's family members shared their sentiments on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``God blessed Me &amp; Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby proud of the fight we along with all of you put up for him God bless,'' Tracy Martin, Trayvon's dad, tweeted seconds after the verdict was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mum, didn't speak out until an hour after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I will love you forever Trayvon In the name of Jesus''.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman found not guilty By Lizette Alvarez in Sanford, Florida A FREE MAN: Above, George Zimmerman leaves the court after being acquitted. Below, demonstrators react to the verdict in Los Angeles. Photos: Reuters George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, igniting a national debate in the US on racial profiling and civil rights, has been found not guilty of second-degree murder. He also was acquitted on the lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing three weeks of testimony, the six-woman jury rejected the prosecution's claim that Mr Zimmerman had pursued Martin because he assumed the hoodie-clad teenager was a criminal and instigated the fight that led to his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman said he shot Martin on February 26 last year in self- defence after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him and slammed his head repeatedly against the footpath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In finding him not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the jury agreed that Mr Zimmerman could have been justified in shooting Martin because he feared great bodily harm or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury, which has been sequestered since June 24, deliberated for 16 hours and 20 minutes over two days. The six female jurors entered the quiet, tense courtroom, several looking exhausted, their faces drawn and grim. After the verdict was read, they assented, one by one, and quietly, their agreement with the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case began in the small city of Sanford as a routine death investigation but soon evolved into a civil rights cause examining racial profiling and its consequences - an issue barred from the courtroom - setting off a broad discussion of race relations in America. Martin, with his gray hooded sweatshirt and his Skittles - the sweets he was carrying - became its catalyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Barack Obama weighed in a month after the shooting, expressing sympathy for Martin's family and urging a thorough investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I had a son,&quot; Mr Obama said, &quot;he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the verdict was read, Mr Zimmerman, 29, smiled slightly. His wife, Shellie, and several of his friends wept, and his parents embraced. The dead youth's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who lost their son a few weeks after his 17th birthday, were not present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Judge Debra Nelson, of Seminole County Court, told Mr Zimmerman, who has been in hiding and wears a bulletproof vest outside, that his bond was revoked and his GPS monitor would be cut off. &quot;You have no further business with the court,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, about 100 protesters who had been gathering through the night began pumping their fists in the air, waving placards and chanting: &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff's deputies lined up inside the courthouse, watching the crowd. But an hour after the verdict, the crowd started to dwindle; fists were no longer aloft and placards had come down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except firing the gun in self-defence,&quot; one of his lawyers, Mark O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Corey, the state attorney who brought the charges, rebuffed the suggestion that her office overcharged Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We charged what we had based on the facts of the case,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We truly believe the mindset of George Zimmerman and the reason he was doing what he did fit the bill for second-degree murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said he had urged Martin's parents to stay out of the courtroom for the verdict. They were grateful for all the support, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Crump asked family supporters to keep the peace and read a Twitter message from Bernice King, Martin Luther King jnr's daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever the Zimmerman verdict is,&quot; Mr Crump read, &quot;in the words of my father, we must conduct ourselves on the higher plane of dignity and discipline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police chief Cecil Smith said the downtown area was open and neighbourhoods were calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr O'Mara disputed that Mr Zimmerman engaged in racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His history was not as a racist,&quot; he said. If Mr Zimmerman was black, he probably would never have been charged, he said. &quot;This became a focus for a civil rights event ... [and] they decided George Zimmerman was to blame and to use this as a civil rights violation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while defence lawyers were elated with the verdict, they also expressed anger that Mr Zimmerman spent 16 months filled with fear and trauma when all he was doing was defending himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prosecution of George Zimmerman was a disgrace,&quot; one of Zimmerman's lawyers, Don West said. &quot;I am thrilled that this jury kept this tragedy from become a travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting drew attention to Florida's expansive self-defence laws that allow someone with a reasonable fear of great bodily harm or death to use lethal force, even if retreating from danger is an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In court, the gunman is given the benefit of the doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcry began after the police initially decided not to arrest Mr Zimmerman as they investigated the shooting. Martin, 17, had no criminal record and was returning to the house where he was staying as a guest after going out to buy snacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six weeks later, Mr Zimmerman was arrested, but only after civil rights leaders championed the case, and demonstrators marched in Sanford, Miami and elsewehre to demand action. New York Times</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--When Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed communities across the country held vigils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, I wrote about not bringing my then 7-year-old son to a vigil in Hyannis because I didn't want him to pick up this country's heavy racial baggage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that Martin's killer has been acquitted, with only a few short years before my son becomes a teenager, I can't delay &quot;the talk&quot; much longer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury could have found George Zimmerman guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. But they let him off scot-free. Now, he can have his guns back and resume his they-always-get-away-with-it neighborhood watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the judge told the jury they didn't have to explain their deliberations to anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you decide to let an adult coward -- twice the size and almost twice the age of a skinny, unarmed teenager -- go free, after said adult coward kills the teenager for simply looking &quot;suspicious,&quot; we need to know: What, in their eyes, did Trayvon do wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you telling us that if an overzealous coward sees a young black male, and that coward approaches the young man, asking what he is doing here or there, if that young man doesn't start acting all &quot;no sah, yes sah,&quot; he can be justifiably killed?!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure some know-it-all legal expert can explain how the jury wasn't supposed to consider social ramifications. But, in a country where millions think of Zimmerman as a &quot;hero&quot; precisely because he shot and killed one of &quot;them,&quot; the message seems clear: It's open season on young black males and if anyone stops to question a young black man -- cop or citizen -- should he not immediately put on a Stepin Fetchit show, he can be killed, regardless of who initiates the encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My friend Bill Fletcher took the words out of my mouth in sharing with me his sober reaction. &quot;I was prepared, intellectually, for a not-guilty verdict. I was not ready in my gut,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This verdict is a verdict in favor of white fear. This is a verdict that says white people have every right to fear any and every black person and, if the law permits it, to act upon such fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ignorant and those in denial will say Zimmerman was Latino -- as if that somehow prevents him from believing all the black stereotypes beaten into our heads from Al Jolson and &quot;Birth Of A Nation&quot; to the reality police shows of today where the perps are always black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I'm going to have &quot;the talk&quot; with my son so I can explain to him that we live in a nation crawling with cowards -- people who will fear for their lives solely on the basis of skin color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll have to tell him about fear-mongers, most of whom don't know any real black people personally other than maybe a co-worker who they'll claim as a &quot;good friend&quot; whenever they need to &quot;prove&quot; they are &quot;color-blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will have to explain, even though everyone loves to talk about individualism, when it comes to black folk, he will first be defined by the worst elements in black America and be made to pay a collective racial tax, regardless of his individual character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this country, when a black person commits a crime it's still considered a commentary on race. But when a white person commits a crime, he or she is judged as an individual and NO ONE suggests obvious absurdities about how the actions of that one person somehow says something about the rest of &quot;them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe I'll show him an email I got just a few weeks ago from a reader who identified himself as white responding to something I wrote about the Voting Rights Act. Instead of talking about voting rights, he went on an incoherent rant about how there are certain urban areas where white people cannot visit because of black &quot;goons.&quot; No mention of Klan country or even Sanford, Fla. -- just one long screed about stereotypical &quot;black areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, I'll have to emphasize that while the legacy of racial fear and ignorance is still with us, it's more complicated than black and white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, my son, along with 12 great kids, played their hearts out in a thrilling baseball tournament. On the diamond, color didn't mean a thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the games were over, his coach -- one of the most decent police officers and human beings you'll ever meet -- invited the team and their parents to his house for a pool party. The kids had a blast, a bonding experience that will last a lifetime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, when I tucked Sean Jr. in bed that night, I thought about Trayvon's parents. Did they ever have &quot;the talk&quot; with their son?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I'm going to have a talk with my son, especially now that the Zimmerman jury, unwittingly perhaps, declared open season on young black males like my son who live in a country where his life may depend on the subjective cowardly fears of gun-toting vigilantes (&quot;You gettin' uppity with me boy?&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd rather stick to baseball, science, and spirituality but alas, I'll have to warn him of the dangers he will face. And I will prepare him to stand his ground. I will tell him to judge people as individuals, even though he won't be afforded that same privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question is: where should we have this conversation -- on a baseball field or at a gun range?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued later in the day, the Justice Department said its civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida are evaluating evidence generated during a federal inquiry opened last year, in addition to evidence and testimony from the state trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,&quot; the statement said. It said the DOJ will determine &quot;whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criminal civil-rights laws at the department's disposal have been used to make such cases in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them: the federal prosecution of a group of Los Angeles police officers after they were acquitted in state court of the brutal beating of Rodney King in 1991, which sparked riots in that city. Two of the four officers were eventually convicted by a federal jury of violating King's civil rights under &quot;color of law&quot; - that is, beating him up in their capacity as cops. That law applies only to those in law enforcement, however, and Zimmerman is a civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his case, it's possible the department might consider using a different type of civil-rights law: the federal hate-crime statute. As in the King case, the double-jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution does not prohibit such a federal prosecution after Zimmerman's state acquittal. Legal experts said it would be a formidable challenge for Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to make a hate-crime case against Zimmerman under U.S. civil rights laws, because Florida jurors found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors found that prosecutors failed to prove the more serious second-degree charge that Zimmerman, the neighborhood watchman at a Sanford gated community, possessed &quot;ill-will,&quot; &quot;hatred&quot; or &quot;spite&quot; in the fatal shooting of Martin. Instead, the six female jurors found that Zimmerman acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, experts said, it would be legally inconsistent for the Justice Department to consider filing criminal charges against Zimmerman under the federal Shepard-Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. Generally, that law prohibits someone from &quot;willfully causing bodily injury&quot; because of race, color, religion or national origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the state jury had been persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman caused bodily harm to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because of Martin's race, it would have almost certainly convicted Zimmerman of second-degree murder, which requires proof of 'ill-will' or 'malice,'&quot; said Scott Srebnick, a prominent federal criminal defense attorney in Miami. &quot;So, to bring a federal civil-rights prosecution against Zimmerman, the attorney general would essentially be second-guessing the state jury's verdict, as opposed to vindicating a different or broader federal interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it doubtful that the attorney general will pursue a prosecution on a civil-rights theory simply out of displeasure with the state jury's verdict,&quot; Srebnick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Tannebaum, a Miami defense attorney and past president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are comparing this case to Rodney King, where there was a federal prosecution after a state acquittal, but the difference there was there were witnesses, specifically the video everyone still remembers,&quot; Tannebaum said, referring to a videotape of the police beating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman was a failed prosecution from the beginning - where the only witness [Zimmerman] had the right to remain silent [by not testifying] - and I don't think the federal government will try again,&quot; Tannebaum said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the NAACP, in a statement issued by President Benjamin Todd Jealous, said the civil rights group is &quot;not done demanding justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fairmont State University's College of Science and Technology and the University of Charleston's School of Pharmacy will give Scouts information about school programs during the Jamboree, held July 15-24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fairmont State will participate in the Technology Quest area, which will showcase science and technology. Scouts will have a chance to participate in activities, demonstrations and more from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The college's demonstrations will include high-tech surveying equipment that will teach Scouts how to establish and obtain accurate distance measurements; a rapid prototyper that allows the use of CAD software and a 3-D printer that can design and produce a 3-D version of the 2013 National Scout Jamboree at Summit logo as a giveaway for the Scouts; and a computerized, numerically controlled woodcarver that will also allow Scouts to produce a 3-D version of the Jamboree logo to keep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UC will also participate in the Technology Quest area and give Scouts the opportunity to learn more about asthma and allergies in an interactive environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scouts can learn about medical conditions and how drugs used in asthma and severe allergies work, about medicine and pharmacy, and how to be prepared in situations that may occur to an individual or fellow Scout with asthma or allergies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four stations in the tent will include a simulation mannequin that will present signs and symptoms of a patient experiencing an asthma attack or allergic reaction, interactive games that will demonstrate how allergies and asthma affect the body, a game show where Scouts will compete by answering questions about asthma and allergies, and a mucous compounding station which will allow Scouts to &quot;make&quot; mucous - a component of asthma.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year and a half of living as a hermit, George Zimmerman emerged from a Florida courthouse a free man, cleared of all charges in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His brother said the former neighborhood watch volunteer was still processing the reality he wouldn't serve prison time for the killing, which Zimmerman, 29, has maintained was an act of self-defense. A jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder late Saturday night and declined to convict him on a lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, with many critics angry over his acquittal, his freedom will likely be limited. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators upset with the verdict protested mostly peacefully in Florida and Atlanta overnight, but some broke windows and vandalized a police squad car in Oakland during protests in four California cities, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot;Robert Zimmerman Jr. said during an interview on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's killing in February 2012 unleashed furious debate across the US over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. Protesters across the country lashed out against police in the Orlando suburb of Sanford, outraged that it took 44 days for Zimmerman to be arrested. Many, including Martin's parents, claimed Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen. Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six anonymous female jurors - all but one of them white - considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They deliberated more than 15 hours over two days before announcing late on Saturday night that they had reached a verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said in August that Zimmerman had been living &quot;like a hermit&quot;, and he and his wife, Shellie, were not working because they feared for their safety. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Saturday's verdict, police, officials and civil rights leaders urged peace and told protesters not to resort to violence. While defense attorneys said they were thrilled with the outcome, O'Mara suggested Zimmerman's safety will be an ongoing concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,&quot;O'Mara said. &quot;They won't listen to a verdict of not guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those watching reacted strongly when the verdict was announced. Martin's mother and father were not in the courtroom when it was read, but supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled, &quot;No! No!&quot;upon learning of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Perkins, 55, a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse, &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tensions still high in Egypt after the military ouster of the elected president, Muslims on both sides of a sharp political divide nonetheless began to pray and fast last week in observance of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, Florida, too, after Saturday's not-guilty verdict for George Zimmerman, churches across the city of 54,000 welcomed people to a special day of prayer on Monday. For months, a coalition of black and white religious leaders known as Sanford Pastors Connecting had worked together to help the city cope with issues surrounding the killing of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communities with large numbers of faithful are often challenged to bring healing in the face of violence and social friction. Religion is too often used to justify hatred or even killing. Most of the time, however, it serves as an opportunity for an entire people to forgive each other, do good deeds, and reflect on a need for God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the peaceful practice of Islam in Egypt or of Christianity in Sanford will eventually help resolve tensions in those places remains to be seen. But during prayerful rituals like Ramadan or Sanford's special day of community worship, glimmers of hope sometimes emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, pastors were allotted four seats in the courtroom during the Zimmerman trial to help them better inform parishioners of the nuances of the case - beyond the sensationalism portrayed in mass media. And the pastors stepped up efforts to improve race relations and reach out to young people to help them avoid legal trouble. A post-verdict protest in Sanford was very small compared with those in big American cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to rely on a perfect God who can give us his grace to act in a perfect way during difficult and perplexing times,&quot; the Rev. Jeff Krall of Sanford's Family Worship Center told the Orlando Sentinel after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this year's observance of Ramadan, which started just after the military ouster of Mohamed Morsi, almost all Muslims in Egypt are practicing the dawn-to-dusk fast, sharing the traditional evening meal with family and friends, watching special TV miniseries, and praying at night. At the least, the month-long devotions might serve as a cooling-off period - even though the spiritual head of the Muslim Brotherhood called on its followers to suspend Ramadan in favor of a jihad in the form of mass protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holiday, which marks the revelation of the Quran to the prophet Muhammad, will be a test for Egyptians of whether Islam can offer lessons on reconciliation and self-restraint. Ramadan's rituals are infused with generosity, especially toward the poor. Its rhythms of self-denial put a focus on the well-being of others. It is a time for joy, not gloating over political victories or animosity toward opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, thousands of Egyptians, both Muslim and Christian, gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square to take part in an iftar, or the holiday's fast-breaking meal. The Islamic imam who gave a sermon in the square said he hoped the event would help end the nation's divide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This iftar is a national unity meal in order for us to say that Egyptians, Muslims and Christians, make up one square and one nation,&quot; said Mohamed Abdullah Nasser. Similar words might have been spoken in war-torn Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramadan's main lesson is patience, which Egyptians badly need now. In Sanford, too, churches are working to create a patience and a meekness that can mend the community. Prayer in such cases isn't a timeout. It's a time for the faithful to practice religion's basic tenets of love.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (CIHAN)- Americans angry at the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin marched in US cities overnight, with reports Sunday of sporadic violence. <BR>Spontaneous marches of varying sizes took place in cities including San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta and Philadelphia.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury in Sanford, Florida late Saturday found Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watchman, not guilty in the death of Martin. <BR>The defense had argued that Zimmerman shot dead the 17-year-old in self-defense on February 26, 2012 during a confrontation in which the teen wrestled him to the ground and bashed his head against the pavement. <BR>Prosecutors argued Zimmerman had racially profiled Martin and stalked the teen -- who was unarmed and had no criminal record -- despite being told by a police dispatcher not to follow him. <BR>Zimmerman, who said Martin attacked him, is the only living witness to how the altercation in the gated community in Sanford began. <BR>The trial has riveted the nation for weeks, and emotions came to a boiling point as news of the verdict spread. <BR>Prominent rights activists like Jesse Jackson appealed for calm. <BR>&quot;Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies. Find a way for self construction not deconstruction in this time of despair,&quot; he wrote on Twitter. <BR>Martin's parents had called for non-violent demonstrations, quoting civil rights icon Martin Luther King and the Bible. <BR>Several hundred demonstrators marched peacefully amid a heavy police presence in downtown San Francisco soon after the verdict.  <BR>Many carried signs with slogans such as &quot;The people say guilty.&quot; <BR>Hours later, angry protesters marching through Oakland -- just across the bay from San Francisco -- spray-painted cars and smashed windows, helicopter video footage posted by the Oakland Tribune showed.  <BR>One vandalized vehicle was a police cruiser. <BR>In Chicago, to the cry of &quot;No justice, no peace! No racist police!&quot; a crowd of activists held a noisy downtown rally, the Chicago Tribune reported, while protesters also gathered in Times Square in New York City to vent their anger. <BR>In Los Angeles, some 200 demonstrators gathered at a protest overnight, while Washington, DC saw dozens of mostly African-American youths marching and chanting slogans in at least one neighborhood. <BR>A crowd of several hundred people gathered all day Saturday outside the courthouse in Sanford, Florida -- and many were outraged when the verdict was read.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the end of our justice system,&quot; said Ashton Summer, a 20-year-old Puerto Rican. &quot;Justice is not equal for everyone.&quot; <BR>The ANSWER coalition, which helped organize large protest rallies during the Iraq war, said it would hold marches Sunday in seven US cities, as well as three separate ones in New York. <BR>&quot;We are very saddened by the jury's verdict,&quot; said Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump after the verdict was read. &quot;The family is heartbroken.&quot; <BR>Rights activist Al Sharpton posted a statement on Facebook describing Zimmerman's acquittal as &quot;a slap in the face to the American people.&quot; <BR>He said he would ask US officials to consider filing federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman <BR>Benjamin Todd Jealous, head of the NAACP, the premier US civil rights group, said his organization was &quot;outraged and heartbroken&quot; over the verdict. <BR>Several US celebrities also weighed in expressing outrage. <BR>&quot;Enough. For now,&quot; Hollywood actress Mia Farrow tweeted. &quot;May God bless Trayvon's family and grant them strength.&quot; <BR>Rapper Lil Wayne tweeted after a concert Saturday that he &quot;kame bak to my bus and saw da news... I pray 4my kids &amp; yours.&quot; <BR>Pop diva Rihanna wrote on Twitter after the verdict: &quot;This is the saddest news ever!!!&quot; <BR>But Zimmerman's brother Robert told CNN late Saturday that the six all female jurors got the verdict right. <BR>&quot;The jury found he acted appropriately in defending his life in accordance with the law,&quot; George's brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. said on CNN.  <BR>&quot;I think that conjecture and speculation and emotional reaction to what people think may or may not have happened has been dominating the discussion for a long time.&quot; <BR>ch-pb-bur/sg/jk <BR>Soundbites <BR>- <BR>Dopesheet <BR>SHOTLIST: <BR><BR>IMAGES OF PROTESTS IN VARIOUS US CITIES: <BR>SOURCE: CBS <BR><BR>*RESTRICTIONS: <BR>NO RESALE for non-editorial purposes <BR>No Japan <BR>No Free over-the-air broadcasters in Australia  <BR>No US cable news outlets, free over the air networks or stations, their websites and their mobile phone services <BR>** <BR><BR>-VAR blocked freeway July 14, 2013, Los Angeles , CA  <BR><BR>-VAR protests, night of 14-15 July 2013, Los Angeles, CA  <BR><BR>-VAR protests, Times Square, New York, night of 14 to 15  <BR><BR>-VAR protests, Philadelphia, PA, July 14, 2013  <BR><BR>-VAR protests and police, Los Angeles July 15, 2013 <BR><BR>-VAR aerials, Oakland, July 14, 2013 <BR><BR>DURATION: 03:27  <BR>CIHAN</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--A jury's decision late Saturday to acquit neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the killing of an unarmed black teenager resonated from Florida to Northeastern Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was shocked that he was able to walk free, based on the evidence,&quot; Michael Onley, organizer of a rally last year in Wilkes-Barre, said. &quot;I thought he should have at least been charged with manslaughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin's death in Florida in February 2012 sparked outrage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Onley decided to hold a rally. He sent out word via social media, and on April 2, 2012, dozens of area residents donned hooded sweatshirts like the 17-year-old Martin and marched from Kirby Park to Public Square to protest his death and the reluctance of the authorities in Florida to charge Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days later, the Interfaith Resource Center for Peace and Justice held a candlelight vigil in Public Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Onley said he believed Zimmerman, who was supposed to be an authority figure in his community, should have been punished for ignoring the rules. He said Zimmerman, who used profiling and made assumptions, is now going to be subject to profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now for every day he's out in public, he's going to be looked at the same way. It's kind of ironic, actually,&quot; Onley said. &quot;Although he didn't get jail time, he's going to have to live in his skin for the rest of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Onley -- whose own brother Anthony was murdered in South Carolina in January 2012 -- said he doesn't wish Zimmerman any harm. But Zimmerman will always be &quot;looking back over his shoulder,&quot; Onley predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's in that position where he's going to be looked at and judged for the rest of his life,&quot; he said. &quot;He's going to be profiled as a killer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests have been made in the killing of Anthony Onley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur Breese, director of Diversity for Geisinger Health Care System, said he is &quot;not at all&quot; surprised by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a travesty on both ends,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just because a jury said Zimmerman was not guilty does not mean he was innocent -- it just means there was &quot;not a preponderance of evidence,&quot; Breese said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six women -- five reportedly white and one Hispanic -- served on the Zimmerman jury. Breese condemned the lack of diversity, a problem he said also pervades Luzerne County juries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breese believed there was a racial element in the case. He said it doesn't matter what we believed Zimmerman was, it's what the police believed he was: &quot;Hispanic&quot; is an ethnicity, not a race. Zimmerman would check &quot;white, Hispanic&quot; on a form, while someone from the Dominican Republic would check &quot;non-white, Hispanic,&quot; Breese said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it had been a black man who killed a white person, there's no question he would have gone to jail, Breese said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case shows that &quot;All life does not have the same value,&quot; Breese said. If all you see is negativity, you'll perceive certain people as being less value than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the verdict's aftermath, Breese sees a need for people to talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has to be some dialogue on this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTS sprung up in cities across America yesterday after George Zimmerman was cleared of criminal charges over the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of seconddegree murder and manslaughter on Saturday night, following a trial that has sparked debate about guns, race and civil rights in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a 29-year-old neighbourhood watchman, argued that he was acting in self-defence when he shot the black 17-year-old in a gated community in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, demonstrators gathered outside the court house, as well as in New York, Washington DC and San Francisco, with some calling for a civil rights prosecution against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called for calm on after the acquittal, saying his death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,&quot; Obama said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  Obama, who last year said that &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; added that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Department of Justice said last night it would review the case to decided if it should consider prosecuting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,&quot; it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice failed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin the night he was killed. We should be appalled and outraged, but perhaps not surprised, that it failed him again Saturday night with a verdict setting his killer free. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal was set in motion Feb. 26, 2012, before Martin's body was cold. When Sanford, Fla., police arrived on the scene, they encountered a grown man who acknowledged killing an unarmed 17-year-old boy. They did not arrest him or test for drug or alcohol use. They conducted a less-than-energetic search for forensic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a national outcry forced authorities to investigate the killing seriously. Even after six weeks, evidence was found to justify arresting Zimmerman, charging him with second-degree murder. But the chance of dispassionately and definitively establishing what happened that night was probably lost. The only complete narrative was Zimmerman's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors knew that Zimmerman was an overeager would-be cop with a loaded gun. They were told that he profiled Martin -- young, black, hooded sweatshirt -- as a criminal. They heard that he stalked Martin despite the advice of a 911 operator; that the stalking led to a confrontation; and that, in the confrontation, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me, and to many who watched the trial, that Zimmerman recklessly initiated the tragic encounter was enough to establish, at a minimum, guilt of manslaughter. The six women on the jury disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jurors also knew that Martin, at the time of his death, was just three weeks past his 17th birthday. But black boys in this country are not allowed to be children. They are assumed to be men, and to be full of menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if the jury, which included no African-Americans, consciously or unconsciously bought into this racist way of thinking -- there's really no other word. But it hardly matters, because police and prosecutors initially did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption underlying their ho-hum approach to the case was that Zimmerman had the right to self-defense but Martin -- young, male, black -- did not. The assumption was that Zimmerman would fear for his life in a hand-to-hand struggle but Martin -- young, male, black -- would not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone wonders why African-Americans feel so passionately about this case, it's because we know that our 17-year-old sons are boys, not men. We know how frightened our sons would be, walking home alone on a rainy night and realizing they were being followed. We know how they would struggle to decide the right course of action, flight or fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we know that a skinny boy armed only with candy does not pose a mortal threat to a healthy adult man who outweighs him by 50 pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation we must have is about how black men, even black boys, are denied the right to be young, to be vulnerable, to make mistakes. We need to talk about why, for example, black men are no more likely than white men to smoke marijuana but nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was fighting more than George Zimmerman that night. He was up against prejudices as old as American history, and he never had a chance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right-wing noise machine, as exemplified by sanctimonious con artists on radio talk shows, should amaze all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common sense says that if the deaths of four Americans in an attack on our embassy in Benghazi was &quot;all Obama's fault,&quot; then the violent deaths of more than 250 Americans at our embassy in Beirut in 1983 clearly must have been &quot;all Reagan's fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Same with the uproar about the Obama administration unlawfully and without warrants, tapping into the phone conversations of American citizens. What a horrible crime! As I remember, President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were doing the exact same thing for more than six years. Even Cheney stated recently that he saw &quot;nothing wrong&quot; with President Obama's actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The true definition of hypocrite: someone who loudly complains about the wrongful actions of Democrats yet remains purposely silent when Republican politicians do the same thing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Socialism ends when there's no more taxpayer money left for the government to give to the non-producing consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are fortunate right now because there's lots of production from American companies and our farmers, in addition to imports. When we combine this with all the government payments -- food stamps, welfare, government programs, gigantic government salaries, benefits and pensions -- our retail sector is doing very well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People will spend all the money they receive. Great! We have a wonderful economy as long as we can collect taxes and print money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will our great economy last forever? Maybe, maybe not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Obama administration's heavy attack on our family farms with taxes, permits, regulations and the death tax, we may come to a similar point that destroyed the Roman Empire 1,700 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That empire was so strong for 400 years because it had plenty of food. Farmers were prosperous because they sold their food to the economy. When taxes and regulations became so tenuous, the family farms finally reached a boiling point and stopped producing food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It happened 1,700 years ago and it will happen again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not understand why the Florida law allowing a person to kill someone when they feel threatened does not apply to Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager was walking down the street with a bag of Skittles and ice tea when George Zimmerman, who was more fit then, got out of his truck, contrary to directions from a 911 operator, with a gun. The next thing you know, the teenager is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why hasn't Zimmerman been locked up in jail from the beginning? Is this a case of racism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And was it racism or just plain hateful ignorance that was behind defense attorney Don West's daughter's posting a photo on Instagram with the caption: &quot;We beat stupidity celebration cones?&quot; As if the tasteless knock-knock joke wasn't bad enough!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could West and his family be any more insensitive to people with learning disabilities or born in different situations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My heart goes out to Rachel Jeantel. It is certainly understandable why she lied in an attempt not to get involved and be thrown to the mercy of a well-educated, slick attorney who apparently has no moral fiber.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do we? This is costly for everyone, and very difficult for commuters. BART and its employees can bargain without making it difficult for the public, and as far as I can see, BART employees are pretty well off.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News that California's per-capita creation of wastes has decreased from 4.4 pounds per person per day to 4.3 pounds (June 30) in the last year masks that the population has increased by 300,000 people, so the volume of wasted materials may stay about the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State staff erroneously (in my opinion) switched to a per-capita system of measurement about six years ago that fails to show serious progress in waste reduction during a depressed economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more interesting is the behavior of some businesses and families that make ounces of waste a day through careful purchasing and careful management of their used materials. Eight of the 10 largest cities in California have established zero waste goals, but the numbers don't show much progress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's set aside the issue of race for just a moment in the Trayvon Martin case. Strip away the hyperbole on the left and the right and cut to the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is what the not-guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial tells us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the state of Florida, a grown man can stalk a teenage boy whom he thinks &quot;is up to no good&quot; in his gated community. He can disobey a police dispatcher who tells him not to follow the 17-year-old. When the teen, who happens to be visiting the man's neighbor, gets upset that some stranger is following him and the two wind up in a brawl, the man can pull out a concealed gun and shoot him dead. Then he can claim self-defense even though he was the one who provoked the confrontation. Walk away scot free with the law on his side. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a jury of six women found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. A number of legal experts -- among them civil rights attorney John Burris -- have said the prosecution failed to make its case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A legal finding of not guilty, however, does not absolve Zimmerman of the fact that he took the life of a teen who was simply returning from the store with a box of Skittles. A teen who would be alive today if the neighborhood watch member and wanna-be-cop had not initiated a confrontation, then escalated it by pulling a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic circumstances of Martin's killing just three weeks after his 17th birthday are deserving of the national protests since the verdict was handed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful. Except, of course, for in Oakland, where the usual peabrain remnants of Occupy used the occasion of the verdict -- on the heels of the release of the movie &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; about the 2009 killing of Oscar Grant -- as an excuse to trash downtown and attack people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 350,000 people have signed a petition by the NAACP calling on the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. They believe that Zimmerman, who is half-white and half-Peruvian, singled out Martin and ultimately killed him for no other reason than that he was African-American and wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called Martin's killing &quot;tragic and unnecessary&quot; and said the department is investigating to determine whether to file federal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of the debate has been about the role that racial profiling played in the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet I think the main focus ought to be on the insanity of Florida's gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law allows people to defend themselves with force, including deadly force, if they feel threatened in their home, business, car, or a place where they &quot;have a legal right to be&quot; -- rather than retreat if they fear for their lives. The police in Sanford waited 44 days to arrest Zimmerman, in part, because of the right to use force under &quot;Stand Your Ground,&quot; although his lawyers did not use that defense in the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 21 states have versions of the same law, which are an open invitation to vigilantism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida law is so broad it can be interpreted to allow people to use lethal force anytime if they believe their lives are in danger. Nine months after Martin was killed, Jordan Davis, another 17-year-old African-American was gunned down in a gas station parking lot in Jacksonville, Fla. Michael Dunn, 45, who is white, is accused of shooting into a parked car where Davis was sitting because he and his friends wouldn't turn down their music. He has been charged with second-degree murder and goes to trial in September. He is using the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law in his defense. Dunn claimed that he thought Davis and his friends had a gun but none was found in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn, at least, was arrested, unlike Zimmerman, who wasn't charged until the case generated national outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his arrest isn't going to bring Davis back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many more Martins and Davises must there be?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Two consecutive nights of protests over George Zimmerman's acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin brought several assaults and many thousands of dollars in damages but only one arrest -- a dissonance some Oakland businesses and leaders find hard to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While few protesters resorted to violence and vandalism, rage over the verdict was real and raw in this city. But with Oakland police under unprecedented federal oversight for past transgressions and the city having just agreed to pay millions in legal settlements for its handling of previous protests, officers clearly reacted with a very light hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a little bit frustrating to see no action,&quot; said Natalie Nadimi, community engagement manager for Oaklandish, an apparel store that had four windows smashed Saturday. &quot;I don't know if no action is the appropriate solution. There needs to be a middle ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interim police Chief Sean Whent, who surveyed the damage Monday, said police were lightly staffed Saturday and caught off guard by the initial protests. Whent said investigators are reviewing surveillance footage in an attempt to make more arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Jean Quan said the city's residents and merchants must speak out clearly and forcefully against such criminal acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not acceptable,&quot; Quan said Monday, though she added police aren't to blame. &quot;No number of police are probably alone going to be able to do it. ... Can we afford to have cops watching 20 people every night all night? These people just have to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in the city are pretty tired. We're pretty weary of people coming and doing this and particularly giving us a bad image. ... It's a city that's very sad and very mad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windows were smashed, walls and windows were spray-painted and a Bay Area News Group photographer and KTVU cameraman were attacked, as a small number resorted to violence and vandalism Saturday and Sunday nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pair of police officers who were told of the photographer's injury didn't get out of their van Sunday but rather continued following the crowd as it moved up Telegraph Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That doesn't sound right to me, doesn't sound very professional,&quot; said Sam Walker, a University of Nebraska, Omaha, criminal justice professor who has consulted for the Oakland police and U.S. Justice Department on use of force. &quot;To not make arrests when you see a reporter or somebody else being attacked makes no sense at all -- that's almost an invitation to more criminal conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person was arrested later on an unrelated charge of failing to disperse after police declared the march an unlawful assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses on Broadway near Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, a gathering point for protesters, have been easy targets for vandals during past protests. Juno Thomas, manager of the city's Business Assistance Center, once again made the rounds there Monday, offering the city's aid in boarding up windows, filing police reports and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadimi said police were slow to respond to requests from Oaklandish to file a police report. But she said Oaklandish has no plans to move. &quot;We really represent what Oakland is about and where it's going,&quot; Nadimi said. &quot;There's no question we are going to stay here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 people were inside the Dogwood bar on Telegraph Avenue at 17th Street when protesters smashed the front windows with bicycle locks Saturday; employees rushed forward and were &quot;physically pushing them away,&quot; owner Alexeis Filipello said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police arrived about 45 minutes later, she warned them that a mob of about 50 was setting trash cans afire on 17th Street. &quot;Basically the police officer said, 'There's nothing I can do, and I don't care,'&quot; Filipello said. &quot;It was such a 'not-our-problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When is enough, enough?&quot; she asked Monday. &quot;How are we supposed to get help?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent told reporters he thought most of the vandalism was committed by people who live outside Oakland. He said the department hadn't known that the Zimmerman jury would deliberate over the weekend, so only eight to 10 officers were immediately available Saturday to police a protest of 150 people that grew increasingly violent and destructive. When asked if he was happy about the staffing, Whent replied, &quot;No, not at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker was amazed by this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How out of it are they? You couldn't find a cable channel that wasn't covering the trial and anticipating the verdict,&quot; he said. &quot;A much better job can be done, even in this difficult type of situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But University of South Carolina professor Geoffrey Alpert, an expert in police decision-making and use of force, said it's not easy for a department -- especially one so roundly criticized for past decisions -- to strike a balance between overreaction and under-reaction. &quot;They may not be finding a sweet spot, but most departments don't,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police agencies sometimes believe it's better for a disturbance like this to run its course than to put protesters and officers alike at risk in a head-on clash, Alpert said. &quot;And that's not a bad strategy. If their intelligence shows it's not organized, there aren't outsiders and the fires aren't being fueled with dynamite, maybe it's better to let people vent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- A crowd of several hundred people protesting the acquittal of George Zimmerman in Florida briefly shut down traffic on Interstate 880 during a lengthy march Monday evening, blocking numerous streets before a group of more than 100 people scuffled with police shortly after 11 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one person was injured when he was struck on the head with a hammer or a similar object. Witnesses said a protester was injured and writhing in pain at Broadway and 16th Street after apparently being struck in the shoulder by a police projectile. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late-night skirmishes began after police charged at several vandals who smashed windows at the Men's Warehouse at 15th Street and Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police deployed flash-bang grenades; protesters threw fireworks at lines of officers wearing riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters later marched up Broadway and Telegraph Avenue, where people stood in front of bars and restaurants to protect them from window-smashing vandals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A waiter was hit with what appeared to be a hammer while protecting the windows at Flora, a restaurant at the corner of Telegraph and 19th Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Protesters with black masks approached the window and tried to bang at it,&quot; said bartender Phillip Ricafort. &quot;(The waiter) said, 'Don't do that!' and the guy turned around and smacked him in the face with a hammer&quot; or another metal object.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was gruesome,&quot; said Ricafort. He said his co-worker was bleeding from the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vandals also targeted Flora's windows over the weekend; several windows were still boarded up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man's co-workers were helping him ice his head on a chair in the back of the restaurant as they waited for an ambulance. Police also stopped to check on them before marching on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening began peacefully, though police were soon challenged as protesters shifted directions in an attempt to stay ahead of the officers keeping tabs on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters chanted &quot;Trayvon&quot; as they marched through downtown Oakland and then around Lake Merritt. Several protesters wearing masks tagged buildings as they marched. An American flag was burned at the intersection of Lakeshore and El Embarcadero near the eastern tip of Lake Merritt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cat-and-mouse game between protesters and police extended to Twitter, where protest sympathizers listening to the police scanner reported police directives for marchers to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mutual aid call from Oakland brought law enforcement officers from at least nine other departments, including the California Highway Patrol, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office and police departments in Berkeley, San Leandro, Hayward, Pleasanton, Union City, Fremont and Newark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said they had arrested nine people, including one juvenile, on misdemeanor and felony charges ranging from assault with a deadly weapon to vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the nine suspects arrested, three were Oakland residents, according to Oakland police Officer Johnna Watson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters gathered around 6 p.m., rallying in Frank Ogawa Plaza before moving south and walking up onramps to Interstate 880 at Broadway around 7:15 p.m. Police quickly swarmed the onramp, herding protesters off the roadway and arresting at least one person before reopening all lanes around 7:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several demonstrators linked arms in front of motorists, while others chanted &quot;If LA can do it, we can do it too.&quot; One officer shouted at them, &quot;You've got to go. You will go to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest then moved through Chinatown, heading around the lake's west shore. Protesters were headed off by police as they attempted to walk onto Interstate 580 at Lakeshore Avenue shortly before 9 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 250 demonstrators were still on the march around 10 p.m. when the group encountered police outside the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse. The group headed back toward downtown, where lines of riot gear-clad police attempted to cut them off as officials read dispersal orders over loudspeakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests also were reported in Los Angeles on Monday as the nation continued to deal with the acquittal of Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager who was returning home from a trip to the grocery store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case prompted a national debate over racial profiling and the Saturday's verdict by a Sanford, Fla. jury prompted mostly peaceful weekend protests in San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, however -- a city that has become accustomed to raucous demonstrations since Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a BART police officer four years ago -- nightfall led to rowdy, chaotic protests that, in a few instances, turned violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loosely organized protest of about 150 people late Saturday night resulted in widespread vandalism, and a few protesters beat one man in a Broadway doorway near Frank H. Ogawa Plaza until other protesters ended the skirmish. The man was helped to his feet and did not appear seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group shattered numerous storefront windows, spray-painted buildings and a police car, and started several small fires in the streets. No arrests were reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's demonstration began peacefully with a two-hour afternoon march from downtown to West Oakland and back, ending with protesters sitting in the intersection of 14th Street and Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, a small group of protesters started heading north on Telegraph Avenue and quickly turned violent, attacking a KTVU photographer and a Bay Area News Group photographer who suffered minor injuries when he was kicked on the ground and his camera was ripped from his shoulder. Police made only one arrest, of someone who refused to disperse and did not have identification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses along Telegraph Avenue and Broadway took the brunt of the damage from the weekend protests, with 61 windows broken or shattered at 14 buildings, according to police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS PROTESTERS took to the streets Sunday to condemn George Zimmerman?s acquittal, the Justice Department said it would review the case for possible violations of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin?s civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder had begun the investigation last year into whether the deadly confrontation between Zimmerman, 29, and Trayvon, 17, was motivated by racial profiling, but he stepped aside to let the trial in a Florida court proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A six-member jury found Zimmerman not guilty on counts of second-degree murder and lesser charges Saturday, setting off widespread outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the feds opened the door Sunday to reopening the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,? the Justice Department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement came as welcome news to civil rights leaders, who began calling for the federal charges almost immediately after the verdict was read in Seminole County court in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?We are outraged and heartbroken over today?s verdict,? NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice; we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Stand Your Ground? is the Florida law that gives a gunman the benefit of the doubt if he feels threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to testimony, Zimmerman was well aware of the law when he, acting as a neighborhood watchman, confronted Trayvon. The teen was wearing a hoodie ? which later became the symbol of his tragic death ? and walking through a gated community near his father?s home carrying a bag of Skittles. The struggle concluded with the killing of the teen. But the jury said Zimmerman shot Trayvon in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous started a petition calling on Holder to bring civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?The most fundamental of civil rights ? the right to life ? was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,? Jealous wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 5 p.m. Sunday, the online petition had more than 160,000 signatures. A similar petition on WhiteHouse.gov was approaching 100,000 signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama called for calm ? and sought to diminish the growing outrage over a system that protesters said placed lesser value on the life of a 17-year-old black teenager returning from a simple trip to a store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,? Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?We should ask ourselves if we?re doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who was in hiding and fearing for his life after the verdict, will also likely face a civil suit brought by Trayvon?s parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?There is still the potential for justice to be served through a civil suit brought about by Trayvon&nbsp;Martin?s surviving family members, and also through civil rights charges,? said Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers? Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who called the verdict ?a miscarriage of justice.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton insisted on NBC?s ?This Week? the fight was far from over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?We now have a position on the books in the State of Florida where an unarmed teenager who committed no crime can be killed and the killer can say self-defense,? Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Every American ought to be afraid that my child can do nothing wrong and can be killed.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But former Gov. Eliot Spitzer ? a candidate for city controller ? threw cold water on the likelihood that Zimmerman would be tried by the feds, saying the legal system was in his favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?The Justice Department will step in, but it?s in a very dicey position because there has been a criminal case. Double jeopardy is a fundamental principle in our American judicial system, as it should be. And so it?s going to be hard for them to come back at the defendant,? Spitzer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former state attorney general added that in this case, the judicial system ?failed.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department made it clear that part of its investigation would involve ?whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department?s policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone was eager for the case to continue. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said the killing never should have gone to trial in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?The evidence didn?t support prosecution, and the Justice Department engaged in this, the President engaged in this and turned it into a political issue that should have been handled exclusively with law and order,? King said on ?Fox News Sunday.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People were honoring Trayvon through protests, which were held in Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, thousands of protesters gathered in Harlem, Union Square and downtown Brooklyn. They chanted ?We are all Trayvon? and ?No justice, no peace!? Passersby signed a large yellow banner that read ?Justice for Trayvon.? Others held hands in a solemn circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, protesters marched from Times Square to the upper East Side to Harlem and were headed for the Bronx early Monday. At least seven people were arrested Sunday night in clashes between protesters and police on the upper East Side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles, protesters blocked traffic on a freeway and in another incident threw bottles at police, who reponded by firing bean bag rounds. There were no reports of injuries and only one arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possibility of civil rights charges amounted to a glimmer of hope among the protesters, who said the verdict had diminished their already-low opinion of the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Florida has been dirty for a long time. Trayvon shined a small light on a bigger problem,? said Leshonna Tyson, 42, who was one of about 100 people rallying in Sanford on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict had led her to the conclusion that the only solution was to vote out the Florida lawmakers who support Stand Your Ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?The laws don?t change, the people who make the laws have to change!? she hollered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another protester worried about the message the verdict sent to young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?I read on Twitter things from people who were so happy with this verdict. What kind of template of morality are we setting for our children? You can?t support vigilante killing!? said Faith Riley, who lives in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, at Allen Chapel AME Church, pastor Valerie Houston said she needed spiritual guidance herself after delivering a sermon to 100 parishioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?I cried myself to sleep last night and I didn?t want to get out of bed,? Houston said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the gathering of the relatively small group of protesters, an eerie calm had descended on the central Florida town in the eye of the storm. Authorities had barred protesters from gathering at the Seminole County Courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Willow Tree Cafe in downtown Sanford, waiter Chris Clenen said business had been slow because of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?People are afraid to come out on the weekends ? actually, every weekend the last few weeks,? said Clenen, 22. ?They?re afraid of rioting.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman faces more legitimate concerns regarding his safety. And since he was found not guilty, the neighborhood watchman can have his gun returned to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?I don?t know if he?ll carry a gun now, but I would think he has more reasons to than before,? George?s brother, Robert Zimmerman, said on CNN Sunday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?He?s going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,? Robert Zimmerman added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters reported George Zimmerman was even considering an unexpected career choice following his 16-month experience in the wheels of justice: lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">?Everybody said he was a cop wanna-be, but he?s interested in law,? said Zimmerman?s wife, Leanne Benjamin. ?He sees it as a potential path forward to help other people like himself.?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY STANLEY CROUCH</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. 26</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">623 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some things that are simple but are projected as complex. George Zimmerman should not have been acquitted. He chose to ignore the advice from the police. He never once denied that he, volunteer neighborhood watchman, spoke to law enforcement and disregarded their directive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He chose to get out of the car. From there, all hell broke loose. It would not have if he had stayed inside his vehicle. Zimmerman made a hasty choice, and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin paid for it with his life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But every moment before the conviction and every moment since, we have heard the ideologues, and we continue to hear them, perhaps even louder today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman trial was made into an automatic money pump because the right and the left choose to make decals to carry into battle. Whether lay citizens or paid pundits, none can resist attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so, these shallow attention-seekers have delivered sweeping and definitive conclusions about what the Zimmerman case says about blacks, whites, violence and justice in America today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some would have us believe that Zimmerman is a klansman or something of the sort, a classical American racist like those who killed Emmett Till and bragged about it after being acquitted in Mississippi in 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others - like Mr. Shill, Sean Hannity - make Zimmerman look like the victim, making it seem that Trayvon gave him reasons to feel threatened. Pity the fool. Cut through the clutter and see the facts. A teen is dead because Zimmerman did not follow the orders of the local police to remain in his vehicle and wait for the authorities to arrive. He does not deny that he pursued Trayvon. He does not deny the boy died by his hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the whole case. Nothing that happened afterward makes it any clearer why Zimmerman felt it necessary to track Trayvon, who he had decided was a threatening troublemaker. How?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to say what I just said is not to validate every preconceived stereotype about supposed race-based injustice in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, professional complainers about injustice to so-called minorities are often fundamentally irresponsible. For years, they have ignored the harsh and unshakable reality that the overwhelming majority of black or brown homicides are homegrown. They are committed by other members of the same ethnic groups, not police, not racists or Nazis or white supremacists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must see the truth clearly - even as we unflinchingly see real racism, when it rears its head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such as: The so-called &quot;Southern Avenger,&quot; a former radio shock jock who is a longtime aide on Sen. Rand Paul's staff, wore a ski mask emblazoned with the Stars and Bars of the Confederate Flag. He praised John Wilkes Booth. He sent out many pieces of bigoted prose. He described the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as &quot;Happy N----r Day.&quot; This is actual bigotry, too strong for even Hannity to justify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Schmidt, one of the Republican conservatives who lives in the modern age, like the gang of three - Joe Scarborough, David Frum and Peggy Noonan - feels the GOP has to detoxify itself from such people. And he is right. All of these kinds of professional race-baiting troublemakers come out of the walls whenever a teenager like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is killed by someone called white. The corpses make a delectable money moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The left attacks the accused, and the opportunists on the right pretend there are social issues at stake, when there are none.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will someday think more logically. It is not impossible. When an armed man gets out of a vehicle after being told to stay in it by the police, he makes a profound and fateful error. Whatever happens next is on him, no one else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what the Zimmerman case is about. It is not a grand lesson about racial prejudice in America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 24, 1955, Till, a 14-year-old Chicago teen on vacation in Mississippi, reportedly flirted with a white woman in a store. Four nights later, two men took Till from his bed, beat him, shot him and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River. An all-white jury found the men not guilty of murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Chaney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 21, 1964, Chaney and fellow civil rights workers Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, were arrested in Philadelphia, Miss., by a deputy sheriff and then released into the hands of the KKK. They were shot, and their bodies were buried in an earthen dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Edwards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Jan. 23, 1957, klansmen chased Edwards, thinking he was sleeping with a white woman. They took him by car to a bridge along the Alabama River in Alabama and forced him at gunpoint to jump to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Donald</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a black man was freed by a jury in the killing of a white police officer in Alabama, klansmen retaliated by finding Donald, who was strung up and killed on March 20, 1981, in what is often referred to as the last recorded lynching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Griffith</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 19, 1986, a car carrying Griffith, 23, and three pals broke down on Cross Bay Blvd. in Howard Beach, Queens. After eating at the New Park Pizzeria, the four men were attacked by 10 white men. Griffith tried to flee, but was run over and killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yusef Hawkins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Aug. 23, 1989, Hawkins and three friends headed to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to find out about a car for sale. Instead, they were attacked by a crowd of 10 to 30 white youths. One shot Hawkins twice in the chest, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin, an African-American killed in an attack seen by many as racially motivated, is just the latest name in a sad roll call. These gruesome hate crimes dating to the '50s also stirred widespread shock and fury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a rally at Union Square, demonstrators marched to Times Square and uptown chanting, &quot;No Justice, No Peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, cops stood by. But at least five protesters were arrested in a clash at Park Ave. and E. 71st St. around 10 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At E. 79th St. and Second Ave., police in riot gear moved in to arrest two more people for disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Move back or I will Mace you,&quot; one officer shouted at protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest organizers said at least 12 people were arrested as demonstrators continued marching uptown early Monday. &quot;It got chaotic,&quot; said one protester, adding that bottles were thrown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after George Zimmerman was found not guilty of killing 17-year-old Trayvon, politicians, preachers and protesters seemed united in the belief that justice was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM HARLEM to Times Square to downtown Brooklyn, New Yorkers vented outrage at a Florida jury they said let Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killer get away with murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after George Zimmerman was found not guilty of gunning down the unarmed teen, politicians, preachers and protesters were united in the opinion that justice was denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really want this to be about Trayvon,&quot; Solange Knowles, sister of Beyonc&eacute;, told protesters at a rally she organized at Brooklyn Borough Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands gathered in Union Square and marched toward Times Square, chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are venting our frustration,&quot; said Daniel Maree, who helped organize the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn) said the verdict sends a message that it's &quot;difficult to be a black man in 2013.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally drew Democratic mayoral candidates John Liu and Bill de Blasio, who both condemned the verdict. De Blasio and other protesters called on the federal Department of Justice to bring civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And earlier in the day, the Rev. Nicholas Richards sermonized from the pulpit at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem: &quot;Every generation has its own evil. But our evil is a different kind of evil - our systems are evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Away from the courthouse in Florida, an unprecedented operation involving black church and community leaders, federal authorities and Florida police had been under way to defuse fears of unrest at the end of the trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some were concerned that an acquittal of Mr Zimmerman could provoke the sort of riots that followed the not guilty verdicts for the Los Angeles police officers captured on video beating up Rodney King in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five decades after Martin Luther King's 'I Have A Dream' speech and in the fifth year of America's first black presidency, the agonised soul-searching over the case is a dramatic illustration of America's tortured relationship with race and history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin turned into national controversy after Mr Zimmerman was initially released, unarrested and uncharged. Sanford police had accepted his contention that he had shot the teenager in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That decision increased feelings of resentment against a white-led police force from the local black community that had long-standing grievances about law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson were among prominent black leaders who descended on Sanford to lead protests, although in the days before the verdict they called for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two key developments helped to avert the threat of unrest. Most notably, Mr Zimmerman was put on trial - the primary demand of the &quot;Justice For Trayvon&quot; protests. But the city fathers in Sanford also sacked Bill Lee as police chief for his handling of the case and replaced him with Cecil Smith, a Northerner from Illinois and the first African-American to head law enforcement in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He took office on April 1 but has proved his new mission is no fool's errand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Smith talked about the challenges he faced in an interview at Sanford's new police headquarters, which happens to sit in the middle of the city's historic black neighbourhood of Goldsboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that he was under no illusions about how tough it would be to win trust in much of the black population but also to root out officers with racist attitudes in his own force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have to change mindsets in the community and in this building,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has joined officers on foot for &quot;walk-and-talks&quot;, knocking on doors to ask residents about their concerns, and held public meetings to discuss race relations and the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he has also made clear that if there are white officers with entrenched racist attitudes, he will fire them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is very sad if it takes a tragedy like the death of Trayvon to change things, but if that happens, if we can build some trust between this department and the community, then some good will have come out of this situation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CIVIL RIGHTS leaders expressed fury yesterday after the acquittal of a Florida neighbourhood watch leader of the murder of an unarmed black teenager. In a case that has gripped America, a jury of six women found George Zimmerman, 29, not guilty both of second degree murder and the lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It accepted that he had acted in selfdefence when he shot and killed 17-yearold Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as the teenager walked home from a sweet shop to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, near Orlando, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night wearing a hoodie, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good&quot;. A fight ensured during which he shot Trayvon dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Zimmerman, a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop&quot;, smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trayvon's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were at the heart of the campaign for justice for their son, chose not to be in court on Saturday evening and spent yesterday morning in church, praying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police did not initially file charges against Mr Zimmerman. He was arrested 44 days after the shooting following nationwide outrage and the intervention of Rick Scott, the governor of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the weeks after the shooting, large protests took place in Sandford, Miami, New York and elsewhere, many wearing hoodies like the one Trayvon had on the night he died. They claimed that Mr Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teenager - a view shared by Ms Fulton and Mr Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shooting of Trayvon - and the allegation that police had initially failed to investigate Mr Zimmerman adequately because he was white - turned the case into one of the most closely watched since the trials of Rodney King and OJ Simpson, unleashing debate across the country over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama raised the stakes still higher by weighing into the controversy, citing his own experience as a black parent. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; Mr Obama said. &quot;If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night the president said in a White House statement that Trayvon's death was a tragedy, &quot;not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America&quot;, but called for calm amid fears that &quot;passions may be running even higher&quot; following the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as details have emerged about Mr Zimmerman suggesting that the case was less clear-cut than many first presumed, Trayvon supporters continue to question whether - had the roles and skin colours been reversed - the result would have been the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country,&quot; said Al Sharpton, the Baptist minister and civil rights activist who helped to draw attention to the case after police initially released Mr Zimmerman without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What this jury has done is establish a precedent that when you are young and fit a certain profile, you can be committing no crime, just bringing some Skittles and iced tea home to your brother, and be killed and someone can claim self-defence. I think that this is an atrocity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Fulton, who is separated from Mr Martin, wrote on Twitter an hour after the verdict: &quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have. At the end of the day, God is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin wrote: &quot;...even in his death I know my baby proud of the fight we along with all of you put up for him God bless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trayvon's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, wrote: &quot;Et tu America?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the family's lawyer, said of the family: &quot;They are still in disbelief about his death and now they're in disbelief about this verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They're praying and turning to God, a higher authority, to make sense of it all.&quot; Mr Zimmerman has largely lived in hiding since the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His older brother Robert wrote: &quot;Message from Dad: 'Our whole family is relieved'. Today ... I'm proud to be an American. God Bless America! Thank you for your prayers!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed fears for his brother's safety. &quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; he told CNN. &quot;There are people that would want to take the law into their own hands... they will always present a threat to George.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Sharpton and the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) called on the government to consider prosecuting Mr Zimmerman under federal race relations laws following his acquittal under Florida state law. &quot;When you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighbourhood about how they felt especially targeted by [Zimmerman], there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,&quot; said Benjamin Jealous, the president of the NAACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, said: &quot;I remain stunned at the decision. The Department of Justice must intervene to take this to another level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the dead teenager's family gave no indication whether they supported calls for a federal race case or would be filing a civil suit against Mr Zimmerman for financial damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both families, lawyers and the police had appealed for calm after the verdict. The call was largely heeded yesterday as supporters of the Martin family held peaceful demonstration across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-week trial of Mr Zimmerman riveted a nation divided over a story that was initially framed in starkly racist terms but grew more nuanced as it emerged that Mr Zimmerman's mother was Hispanic and he had once taken a black girl to his high-school prom and mentored black children in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial turned on several key defence witnesses who supported Mr Zimmerman's claims that he had acted in self-defence and shot Trayvon as an act of last resort after the teenager banged his head repeatedly into the concrete pavement, a claim consistent with his head injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also pivotal was a taped 911 emergency call in which either Mr Zimmerman or Trayvon was heard screaming &quot;Help! Help!&quot; moments before the fatal shot was fired. Neither side was able to prove who was screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case against Mr Zimmerman turned on convincing the jury that he had maliciously &quot;profiled&quot; the black teenager and made racist assumptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NEIGHBOURHOOD watch captain who was acquitted by a Florida court of murdering an unarmed black teenager could now face prosecution under federal race-relations laws, the US department of justice said last night after it announced a review of his case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision came after a day when civil rights leaders expressed fury that a jury of six women had found George Zimmerman, 29, not guilty both of second degree murder and the lesser charge of manslaughter after shooting dead Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As President Barack Obama issued a statement from the White House calling for calm on all sides, the department of justice said federal prosecutors would now examine the case for a federal prosecution under civil rights legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine ... whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,&quot; the statement said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the best-known precedent, federal race laws were used to convict several police officers who had been acquitted of the infamous beating of Rodney King. However, legal analysts have warned that the race element in the Martin case is far less clear-cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pledge to review the case came after the jury ruled that Mr Zimmerman had acted in self-defence when he shot and killed Martin as the teenager walked home from a sweet shop to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, near Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night wearing a hoodie, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good&quot;. A fight ensued during which he shot Trayvon dead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Obama raised the stakes still higher by weighing into the controversy, citing his own experience as a black parent. &quot;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,&quot; Mr Obama said &quot;If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night the president said in a White House statement that Trayvon's death was a tragedy, &quot;not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America&quot;, but called for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as details have emerged about Mr Zimmerman suggesting that the case was less clear-cut than many first presumed, Trayvon supporters continue to question whether - had the roles and skin colours been reversed - the result would have been the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country,&quot; said Al Sharpton, the Baptist minister and civil rights activist who help to draw attention to the case after police initially released Mr Zimmerman without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What this jury has done is establish a precedent that when you are young and fit a certain profile, you can be committing no crime, just bringing some Skittles and iced tea home to your brother, and be killed and someone can claim self-defence. I think that this is an atrocity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Fulton, who is separated from Mr Martin, wrote on Twitter an hour after the verdict: &quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have. At the end of the day, God is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!&quot; Mr Martin wrote: &quot; ... even in his death I know my baby proud of the fight we along with all of you put up for him God bless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Zimmerman has largely lived in hiding since the shooting. His older brother Robert expressed fears for his brother's safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; he told CNN. &quot;There are people that would want to take the law into their own hands ... they will always present a threat to George.&quot; Mr Sharpton and the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People called on the government to consider prosecuting Mr Zimmerman under federal race relations laws following his acquittal under Florida state law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, said: &quot;I remain stunned at the decision. The Department of Justice must intervene to take this to another level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the dead teenager's family gave no indication whether they supported calls for a federal race case or would be filing a civil suit against Mr Zimmerman for financial damages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both families, lawyers and the police had appealed for calm after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call was largely heeded yesterday as supporters of the Martin family held peaceful demonstrations across the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial of Mr Zimmerman riveted a nation divided over a story that was initially framed in starkly racist terms but grew more nuanced as it emerged that Mr Zimmerman's mother was Hispanic and he had once taken a black girl to his high-school prom and mentored black children in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial turned on several key defence witnesses who supported Mr Zimmerman's claims that he had acted in self-defence and shot Trayvon as an act of last resort after the teenager banged his head repeatedly into the pavement, a claim consistent with his injuries. Also pivotal was a taped 911 call in which either Mr Zimmerman or Trayvon was heard screaming &quot;Help! Help!&quot; moments before the fatal shot was fired. Neither side was able to prove who was screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end the prosecution failed to make its case that Mr Zimmerman had maliciously &quot;profiled&quot; the black teenager and made racist assumptions when he confronted him that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Fundamentally the problem was that the prosecution didn't have a witness, they didn't have someone who could describe who took the first swing, who was the aggressor,&quot; said Jeffrey Toobin, the senior legal analyst for CNN.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE in south Florida were last night considering activating contingency plans for possible riots after the George Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the trial and since Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death in February 2012, officials have been concerned about a potentially violent reaction to the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Miami Dade officers and those in Sanford, have been actively encouraging religious leaders to extol the power of peaceful demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I know that child was born and raised here in Miami and he got killed up in Sanford. But that is no reason for our young folk to get fired up and talk about bringing destruction on the city,'' one Miami pastor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Riots are not acceptable. Riots are not expected,'' Miami Dade police chief JD Patterson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami police have gone beyond their Sanford counterparts and deemed two different parks as ``First Amendment zones'' -- places for people gather if they want to express their thoughts about the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We don't want people in places unplanned, spontaneously, voicing themselves in such a way that it brings up anger and hostility and violence,'' Mr Patterson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the trial was going on in Sanford, police took a pre-emptive approach and went door-to-door warning residents about possible riots should the former Neighbourhood Watch member be acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the verdict was announced, demonstrators outside the court chanted: ``Justice for Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many on Twitter expressed their unhappiness. One user wrote: ``He might be free, but he's a dead man walking.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some posted George Zimmerman's address, urging angry protesters to take action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrities including Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Mandy Moore and Nicki Minaj took to Twitter to criticise the court's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the rap community were among the most outspoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ice Cube tweeted: ``The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict doesn't surprise me. Stanford, FL never wanted Zimmerman arrested. Now he's free to kill another child.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACIAL tensions are at fever pitch in the US with calls for calm after a Hispanic man was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of a black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbourhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman received a wave of online death threats and authorities in Miami were last night working to stave off riots after a six-member jury -- all women, five of them white -- acquitted Mr Zimmerman, who was charged with murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors found 29-year-old Mr Zimmerman acted in self-defence when he shot Mr Martin, an unarmed, black 17-year-old, on February 26, 2012, as the two fought near Mr Zimmerman's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman showed no emotion when the verdict was read yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While defence attorney Mark O'Mara said his team was ecstatic at the outcome, co-counsel Don West was defiant and angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I'm glad this jury kept this tragedy from being a travesty,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury had been given the chance to convict Mr Zimmerman of manslaughter but did not do so, despite asking for a clarification of the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict was a heart-breaking outcome for Mr Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, as well as crowds outside the courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About an hour after the verdict was read, attorneys for Mr Martin's family said they -- and the family -- were urging people to remain calm in the wake of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``For Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful,'' attorney Benjamin Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman shot Mr Martin as the two fought on the ground near Mr Zimmerman's Sanford home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments earlier the defendant had called police, describing Mr Martin, a high school junior from Miami Gardens, as acting suspiciously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite three weeks of evidence, attorneys and witnesses were unable to definitively say how the two came face to face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman said he shot the teenager in self-defence, that Mr Martin had punched him in the nose, breaking it, and knocked him to the ground before hammering his head against a footpath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda said: ``Am I disappointed? Yes, because I thought he was guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His boss, special prosecutor Angela Corey, said her office had not over-reached by charging Mr Zimmerman with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors faced a huge obstacle: They could not prove who threw the first punch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were swayed by the evidence of Rachel Jeantel, a 19-year-old Miami woman on the phone with Mr Martin moments before he was shot, who said Mr Martin was worried about a ``creepy-ass cracker'' who was following him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the trial and since Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death in February 2012, officials have been concerned about a potentially violent reaction to the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Miami Dade officers and those in Sanford have been actively encouraging religious leaders to extol the power of peaceful demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I know that child was born and raised here in Miami and he got killed up in Sanford. But that is no reason for our young folk to get fired up and talk about bringing destruction on the city,'' one Miami pastor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Riots are not acceptable. Riots are not expected,'' Miami Dade police chief JD Patterson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami police have gone beyond their Sanford counterparts and deemed two different parks as ``First Amendment zones'' -- places for people gather if they want to express their thoughts about the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We don't want people in places unplanned, spontaneously, voicing themselves in such a way that it brings up anger and hostility and violence,'' Mr Patterson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the trial was going on in Sanford, police took a pre-emptive approach and went door-to-door warning residents about possible riots should the former Neighbourhood Watch member be acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the verdict was announced, demonstrators outside the court chanted: ``Justice for Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many on Twitter expressed their unhappiness. One user wrote: ``He might be free but he's a dead man walking.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some posted George Zimmerman's address, urging angry protesters to take action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrities including Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Mandy Moore and Nicki Minaj took to Twitter to criticise the court's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the rap community were among the most outspoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ice Cube tweeted: ``The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict doesn't surprise me. Stanford, FL never wanted Zimmerman arrested. Now he's free to kill another child.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICA was braced for the threat of race riots last night after a neighbourhood watch volunteer was acquitted of murdering an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City leaders and police appealed for calm as George Zimmerman walked free from court following the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, who has been warned to wear a bullet-proof vest if he ventures outside, went into hiding after receiving death threats on Twitter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also reports of sporadic violence at angry demonstrations across the US - with protesters in California smashing windows and starting fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's five-week trial had divided the nation, with many believing the killing and subsequent police handling of case was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops failed to act for several weeks until a national outcry led prosecutors to bring charges against Zimmerman, who was described in court as a wannabe police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He shot Martin during a violent struggle after the youngster was seen acting suspiciously in a gated complex which Zimmerman patrolled in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed Martin had gone for his gun after he challenged the youngster over his behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than 16 hours of deliberation a jury unanimously decided that Zimmerman had acted in self defence. They ruled that he &quot;justifiably&quot; killed the unarmed lad because he believed his life was being threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they rejected prosecution claims that screams heard on a recording of a 911 call by Zimmerman were actually Martin pleading for his life. Following J Saturday's verdict, tens of thousands vented their fury on Twitter. One described Zimmerman as &quot;a dead man walking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's heartbroken parents Tracy and Sybrina, from Miami, were not in court to hear the verdict. But they too called for calm, despite admitting their disappointment at the controversial acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy tweeted: &quot;God blessed me &amp; Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby is proud of the FIGHT we along with all of you put up for him. GOD BLESS.&quot; Devastated Sybrina told wellwishers that she was drawing strength from her faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She wrote on Twitter: &quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police later revealed that authorities in Sanford and other parts of the US were taking precautions against the possibility of mass protests or civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County Sheriff Don Eslinger said: &quot;I'm sure none of us wants to see any violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even as he spoke crowds gathered outside the courthouse to voice their outrage. Many were chanting: &quot;The system has failed us!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer Mark O'Mara revealed that Zimmerman and his wife Shellie had been forced into living &quot;like hermits&quot; because of the strength of feeling surrounding the court case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they had not even been able to go to work because of fears of being attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr O'Mara added: &quot;Although he is very, very happy about the court's decision I think that Mr Zimmerman just wishes he could wave a magic wand and get his life back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He and his wife have to be cautious and protective of their safety because there is a fringe element who have said on Twitter and elsewhere that they want revenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Beyonc&eacute; called for a silent tribute in memory of Martin at a concert during her Mrs Carter Show World Tour at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concert had started about 30 minutes after news of the Zimmerman verdict began to circulate through the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The singer told fans: &quot;I'd like to have a moment of silence for Trayvon&quot;, before singing a chorus of I Will Always Love You.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even in his to death I know he is proud of the fight we and you put up for him MARTIN'S DAD TRACY</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICAN cities are braced for race riots following the acquittal of a vigilante who killed an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as the 17-year-old was returning from a trip to the shops, was cleared of murder and manslaughter charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said Zimmerman was a wannabe cop' who identified his victim as a potential troublemaker simply by racial profiling'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But jurors accepted the 29-year-old's claim that he had acted in self-defence after the teenager attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-strong jury included five white women and another woman of undisclosed ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest marches were held within hours of Saturday night's verdict and violence was reported as far away as Oakland in California. Gangs of youths attacked police and attempted to set cars on fire while others smashed windows in a downtown area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police swamped the town of Sanford, Florida, where the trial took place and the gated estate where Trayvon was killed was barricaded off to stop any demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers have put in place plans to stop youths from forming flash mobs' having learned from the London riots where gangs used social media to organise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman went into hiding immediately after the verdict. He was described as a dead man walking', having received numerous death threats. The neighbourhood watch volunteer killed Trayvon in February last year after he spotted the hooded Miami teenager who was visiting a family friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called police to report an intruder and followed Trayvon in his car. At some point the pair got into a fight and Trayvon was shot once in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Sanford, which is about 30 miles from Orlando, initially failed to arrest Zimmerman. The killing was ruled justified under Florida's controversial stand your ground' law which allows the use of deadly force if a person is in fear of their life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after protests across the US, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a three-week trial the case was widely seen to have fallen apart after defence witnesses backed up Zimmerman's story that he was attacked by Trayvon, who apparently told him he was going to die tonight'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crucial part of the evidence rested on who was heard on an emergency call screaming for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents said it was their son, while Zimmerman's family and friends insisted it was him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A forensic expert said the gunshot wound showed Trayvon was on top of Zimmerman when the fatal shot was fired. Legal experts said the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Zimmerman had deliberately killed the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They acknowledged this by asking the judge at the 11th hour to let the jury consider a lesser charge of manslaughter. The jury took 16 hours to find Zimmerman not guilty of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defence team said the case would never have gone to trial had he been black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Michael O'Mara said the case was taken up by civil rights leaders and Zimmerman was charged for political reasons to create a civil rights event'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many celebrities took to Twitter to express outrage at the verdict, while the singer Beyonce held a minute's silence at her concert in Tennessee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest: Supporters demonstrate outside the court Cleared: George Zimmerman</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests were sparked in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta when a jury cleared George Zimmerman over the 17-year-old's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also acquitted of the lesser manslaughter charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gangs of youths attacked police and torched cars while others smashed windows in a downtown area of Oakland, California. Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in gated community The Retreat in Sanford, Florida, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had been driving through the area when he spotted Martin wearing a hoodie walking to a nearby house where he had been staying with friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called the police, claiming Trayvon was behaving suspiciously but before they arrived he confronted the youngster and fired a shot from his 9mm handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was originally released without charge but after a public outcry a murder probe was launched. In court, Zimmerman's lawyers successfully argued he had been acting in self-defence and claimed Trayvon had attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tension was raised after the Florida jury took two days and 16 hours to clear the 29-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and community chiefs urged locals in Sanford to stay calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But rap star P Diddy, 43, voiced his outrage at the verdict, tweeting: &quot;George Zimmerman is free #not right ##NoJusticeForTrayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said in a statement in which he referred to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges - a verdict that stunned the black community and civil rights groups and spurred largely peaceful protests in the streets in several U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a New York City church, one pastor wore a pink hoodie in memory of Martin on Sunday. The boy was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, common garb among teenagers from all walks of life, when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Jacqueline Lewis urged her congregation to remain peaceful, reminding them that Martin Luther King Jr. &quot;would have wanted us to conduct ourselves on the highest plane of dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added: &quot;We're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman's been acquitted in the state case. The department launched a probe a year ago but stepped aside to allow Florida's prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents are also considering a wrongful death civil suit against Zimmerman. Sixteen years ago, O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay $25 million in compensation to Nicole Brown Simpson's family members despite his infamous acquittal in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was 17 and walking to his father's house in Sanford, Fla., carrying a can of iced tea and a box of Skittles, when he was gunned down by Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman claimed he shot the boy in self-defence when Martin began beating on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country still smarting from a painful history of slavery and segregation, many blacks saw overt racism in Zimmerman's focus on a black boy wearing a hoodie as he walked through a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, many argued this weekend, proves the criminal justice system is still inherently biased against black people given Martin, the unarmed slaying victim, was successfully portrayed as the aggressor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There may be a civil action brought by the family, but there should definitely be criminal charges brought by (the Department of Justice),&quot; Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP, said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we have asked D.O.J. to continue their investigation. They are indeed continuing, and we hope that once everything that's happened that can happen here in Florida ... that the D.O.J will act and will hold Mr. Zimmerman accountable for what he has done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to level a hate crime charge, Jealous added, federal investigators need to &quot;show that race was a factor in his decision-making. And there seems to be plenty of evidence that suggests that race may have been a factor. He called 911 a lot about young black men that he suspected of being dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats called the outcome a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans felt differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our justice system is colour-blind,&quot; Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You had two very capable teams laying out the evidence and the jury made the decision. Though there may be people on either side of this who don't agree with how it came out, we have the very best judicial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa congressman Steve King, meantime, said Zimmerman should never have been charged at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I regret that this all happened. I'm sorry that it was turned into a race issue by the media,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat now running for New York City comptroller, called the verdict a &quot;failure of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judicial system is not perfect. And in this case it has failed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With chants and prayers, sermons and signs, outrage over a jury's decision to clear George Zimmerman in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager poured from street protests and church pulpits yesterday amid calls for federal civil rights charges to be filed in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations broke out across the country in support of the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as protesters decried the not guilty verdict as a miscarriage of justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and protesters called for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, who was acquitted on Saturday in Martin's shooting death in February last year, which unleashed a national debate over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said it was looking into the case to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, President Barack Obama and religious and civil rights leaders urged calm in the hope of ensuring peaceful demonstrations in the wake of a case that has become an emotional flash point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York City, hundreds of protesters marched into Times Square last night, zigzagging through Manhattan's streets to avoid police lines. Sign-carrying marchers thronged the busy intersection, chanting &quot;Justice for! Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; as they made their way from Union Square, blocking traffic for more than an hour before moving on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Francisco and Los Angeles - where an earlier protest was dispersed with beanbag rounds - police closed streets as protesters marched to condemn Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rand Powdrill, 41, of San Leandro, said he came to the San Francisco march with about 400 others to &quot;protest (against) the execution of an innocent black teenager&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If our voices can't be heard, then this is just going to keep going on,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Manhattan's Middle Collegiate Church, many congregants wore hooded shirts - the same thing Martin was wearing the night he was shot - in a show of solidarity. Jessica Nacinovich said she could only feel disappointment and sadness over the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure jurors did what they felt was right in accordance with the law but maybe the law is wrong, maybe society is wrong; there's a lot that needs fixing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 200 people turned out for a rally and march in Chicago, saying the verdict was symbolic of lingering racism in the US. Seventy-three-year-old Maya Miller said the case reminded her of the 1955 slaying of Emmitt Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago who was murdered by a group of white men while visiting Mississippi. Till's killing galvanised the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty-eight years and nothing's changed,&quot; Miller said, pausing to join a chant to &quot;Justice for Trayvon, not one more&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters also gathered in Miami, Philadelphia and Washington, DC as well as a host of other cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami, more than 200 people gathered for a vigil. &quot;You can't justify murder&quot;, read one poster. Another read &quot;Don't worry about more riots. Worry about more Zimmermans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Philadelphia, about 700 protesters marched from Love Park to the Liberty Bell, chanting Martin's name and &quot;No justice, no peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope this will begin a movement to end discrimination against young black men,&quot; said Johnathan Cooper, one of the protest's organisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And to empower black people and get them involved in the system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds gathered in Union Square in New York City to voice their passions over the verdict, hoisting placards with images of Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders, including the Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, urged peace in the wake of the verdict. Jackson said the legal system &quot;failed justice&quot;, but violence was not the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all the protesters heeded those calls in the demonstrations that broke out after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, California, some demonstrators broke windows, burned US flags and started street fires. Some marchers vandalised a police car and used spray paint to scrawl anti-police graffiti on roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles, police said a crowd of about 100 protesters surrounded an officer and eventually had to be dispersed by officers firing beanbag rounds. - Sapa-AP</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFP- Thousands protested in US cities overnight as President Barack Obama appealed for calm following the acquittal in Florida of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angry protests highlight simmering racial tensions after a jury found volunteer watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering 17 year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators held noisy rallies in US cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit and Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least six people were arrested in Los Angeles early Monday when riot police broke up an &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; in Hollywood near the CNN building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the chants of &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; a separate crowd blocked traffic on an important freeway elsewhere in the giant metropolis, local media reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memories are still fresh of the deadly April 1992 riots in Los Angeles, which broke out after a similar racially-tinged trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most numerous rally Sunday was in New York City, where several thousand - including families with children - marched to Times Square under the watchful eye of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the multi-racial crowd brandished signs bearing a portrait of Martin, while some, despite sweltering July heat, wore &quot;hoodie&quot; sweatshirts as the teen did the night he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am appalled,&quot; said Carli VanVoorhis, a 21-year-old hairdresser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The man was armed, the kid was not, and the man with the gun got away,&quot; she said. &quot;If we say it was not a racial issue, we would be lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a big problem with race, and another problem is guns,&quot; said protester Rodney Rodriguez. &quot;If Zimmerman didn't have a gun, he couldn't have killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow protester Derreck Wilson, 46, said the group had come &quot;to say in a peaceful way why we are angry. We are angry, scared and anxious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's cathartic,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all have the same desires. I want to be able to have my son to come home,&quot; added Wilson, who came to the protest from the traditionally African-American neighborhood of Harlem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has pitted those who belive that Zimmerman, a 29-year-old Hispanic neighborhood watchman, killed Martin in self-defense, and those who believe it was a murder sparked by racist assumptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, the first black US president, urged Americans to step back and accept the trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; the president said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in the town of Sanford and shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense successfully argued that Zimmerman fired his handgun in self-defense after the teen wrestled him to the ground and was slamming his head against the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, people who fear for their lives can use deadly force to defend themselves without having to flee a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this,&quot; Obama said. &quot;As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama last year spoke emotionally about the case, noting that if he had a son he would &quot;look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racial divide was evident in Sanford pastor Valerie Houston's Sunday sermon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dr (Martin Luther) King (Jr) stated, the daily life of the Negro is still in the basement of the Great Society,&quot; she said. &quot;And today I state, the daily life of my people is still enslaved to a white supremacist society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents - father, Tracy, and mother Sybrina Fulton - asked the public before the verdict to respect the trial outcome, and afterwards gave thanks for the outpouring of support they received over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump declined to say whether they would file a civil lawsuit against Zimmerman, but said &quot;they are going to certainly look at that as an option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They deeply want a sense of justice. They deeply don't want their son's death to be in vain,&quot; he told ABC News's &quot;This Week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department said Sunday it will resume its probe into whether hate crime charges can be brought against Zimmerman. The probe was put on hold until after the Florida trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecutors &quot;will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,&quot; it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the acquital, Zimmerman's lawyers told the Washington Post that they will immediately resume a defamation lawsuit against NBC News for selectively editing a phone call to police which made their client seem like a racist. That case was also put on hold pending the trial results.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The verdict in the Zimmerman case for killing the 17-year-old black man Trayvon Martin is being considered as justice denied. The high profile trial caught the attention of many people around the world due to suspected racial profiling although both the prosecutor and defence lawyers tried to present the case on the basis of self-defence and right or wrong criminal acts rather than racial profiling and discrimination. The victim, who was of African background, was wrongfully profiled as a troublemaker by Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer who saw him walking home wearing a hoody on a rainy night from the utility store. He followed him, had a scuffle and shot the unarmed Martin in the heart to kill him. Zimmerman was armed and physically stronger than Martin. It is difficult to perceive clearly what happened between the two but Zimmerman's self-defence claim does not hold weight, and his acts may relate to his bias and racial hatred rather than self-defence. Despite the racially charged nature of the case, the attorneys for the prosecution have avoided mentioning race during the trial but a vast majority of people thinks that Zimmerman's acts were based on racial hatred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the conflicting testimonies from both sides, selecting a single gender jury of six women with a white majority seems to be abnormal, questionable and suspicious. Besides, Zimmerman was not arrested for 44 days after the incident till the public outcry. How he approached Martin, who punched who, who was on top and how Zimmerman drew a gun are difficult to comprehend but one thing is clear: the case has created social media buzz. The jury, which took 13 hours for deliberation, seems to have struggled to understand the definition of a man slaughtering another, and finally acquitted Zimmerman, granting him the 'not guilty' verdict. All concerned have to accept the jury's decision but many believe that the judiciary failed to deliver justice due to the racial profiling of the victim. This not guilty verdict will be remembered as a sad chapter in US race relations due to shattered faith in the country's judicial system. A white security guard kills an unarmed boy and gets away with the murder. It is extremely regrettable to see that racial profiling is still obvious in some part of the US.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall and UD Law Professor Tom Hagel both thought prosecutors overreached in going for a second-degree murder charge in the Feb. 26, 2012, death of Trayvon Martin instead of concentrating on manslaughter, which was included in jury instructions as an alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't shocked but I was a little surprised just due to the dynamics of this case,&quot; Ha-gel said. &quot;I thought there was a strong chance they'd find (Zimmerman) guilty of manslaughter, but I was not shocked because both sides had a pretty good argument for their positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not long after the verdict was announced, Dayton's Monica Hockett said: &quot;I think it's some bull. He should have been found guilty because he killed that little boy for no reason, basically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beavercreek's Ryan Bevins said: &quot;I feel like it never should have gone to trial. I just don't think they had enough to go with, that's kind of my initial reaction,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it could have gone a lot of different ways. To get a not-guilty (verdict) doesn't really shock or surprise me whatsoever. I think a lot of people were going on emotion but the law is what it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagel said Zimmerman's actions - following Martin under the guise of being a neighborhood crime-watch volunteer - must be kept separate from when Martin allegedly had Zimmerman pinned and slammed his head on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My guess is (Zimmerman) was acting wrongfully at the beginning, but at the time of the killing, did Zimmerman have a right to use deadly force from what he perceived to be the imminent threat of seriously bodily harm or death?&quot; Hagel said. '(Martin) was beating him. I salute the jury. I think they really thought this thing through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennith Inskeep of Indianapolis, in Dayton visiting family, said the verdict wasn't fair. &quot;I feel justice wasn't served,&quot; he said &quot;An unarmed kid, a teenager, slain, another life lost. I think that was kind of foul. Not even a manslaughter, no conviction. It's cut and dried. He wasn't armed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall said the racial aspect of the situation couldn't be ignored, and she said Judge Debra Nelson erred by not allowing more discussion about the reasonableness of Zimmerman following Martin, contrary to neighborhood watch instructions. She said common law used to allow for deadly force in self-defense but asked people to escape if possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground turns on its head everything we have known about self-defense,&quot; Randall said. &quot;Why would they allow people to be the aggressor and then be able to use deadly force after he was losing a fight he started?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the Florida law does is authorize people to act on their biases and prejudices and stereotypes because they can say they were fearful of what this person was going to be doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hagel said a majority of states allow deadly force even if escape is an option, though he's not sure if Zimmerman could have escaped while pinned to the pavement. &quot;You can stand your ground and use deadly force even though you could have got away,&quot; Hagel said. &quot;That's where the big controversy comes in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall's son Tshaka, who was stopped by police while walking home from UD to his Oakwood home in the early 1990s, is now an assistant professor of law at Florida A&amp;M University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wonders to what extent did George Zimmerman having a gun made him more brave than he would have been had he not had a gun,&quot; Vernellia Randall said. &quot;Would he have even confronted that kid if he didn't have that gun?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall said she's always been against guns, but feels maybe she should advise her sons to be armed: &quot;If everybody's going to pack a gun and pull it out and shoot, pull yours out and shoot, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several potential jurors in the George Zimmerman case were dismissed when lawyers discovered Facebook posts and &quot;likes&quot; that revealed their personal views on the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, FLA. - Even Scott Pleasants, a college professor testifying by Skype in the murder trial of one of his former students, couldn't keep a straight face when the sounds of incoming calls derailed the testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His head, projected on a big screen in the courtroom, was soon completely obscured by the pop-up requests of incoming callers. Tech-savvy pranksters watching the George Zimmerman trial on live television bombarded Pleasants' Skype account July 3 while he tried to answer defense attorney Mark O'Mara's questions via Internet video chat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the seriousness of the proceedings - Zimmerman, Pleasants' former criminal-justice student, faced life in prison for the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - the professor and courtroom observers were suppressing laughter, the presiding judge was annoyed, and only O'Mara seemed to have a clue about what was going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I gotta tell you,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;There's now a really good chance that we're being toyed with. Just so you know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Skype incident - Pleas-ants finished his testimony through an iPhone propped on the witness stand - encapsulated the way technology and social media played into every twist and turn of the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the trial was nationally televised gavel-to-gavel, something Americans have grown accustomed to since the O.J. Simpson double-murder trial almost 20 years ago and most recently the Jodi Arias case, many thousands took to Twitter, Facebook and blogs to opine, vent and bicker about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The case touched so many chords, it became a contemporary media event as people tuned in to find out if their view of reality would be affirmed,&quot; said Darnell Hunt, a sociology professor and director of the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African-American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. &quot;The advances in social media and technology made it possible for people to follow the case but also debate it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once a story goes viral, it takes on a life of its own,&quot; Hunt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The web's fascination with the Zimmerman case started soon after the former neighborhood-watch leader fatally shot Martin, 17, of Miami Gardens in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, quickly turned to the Internet, creating a change.org petition to demand the arrest of Zimmerman. The movement garnered more than 2.2 million virtual signatures. The public outcry seemed to work: Zimmerman was arrested 44 days after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As details of the case circulated - an unarmed teen shot dead while carrying a bag of Skittles and an Arizona drink - the hooded sweatshirt that Martin wore became iconic, with scores posting, sharing and tweeting photos of themselves wearing similar garments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami Heat's Lebron James and Dwyane Wade famously posted pictures of themselves and the team donning hoodies in support of Martin. Others used photos of Martin as their Facebook and Twitter avatars, often with the words &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; across the images. As the trial neared an end Friday, thousands changed their online photos to black, using the hashtag #blackout in a sign of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman and his legal team also turned to the Web to rally their backers. Zimmerman created a website, the Real George Zimmerman, in which he made his claim of self-defense, quoted historical figures and included a prompt for contributions. The site is inactive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead counsel, launched another one, gzlegalcase.com, in April 2012, dedicated to raising funds for the legal defense, releasing documents and updates on the case, and acting as a voice for Zimmerman. The site was an uncommon move in criminal trials, but Zimmerman's team said it generated large amounts of traffic and donations and could be the new-normal in such cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Miami School of Law lecturer Jan L. Jacobowitz said attorneys must use the social-media tools at their disposal to effectively represent their clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The George Zimmerman trial highlights the new normal, how social media and technology have become part of cases,&quot; said Jacobowitz, director of the law school's Professional Responsibility and Ethics Program. &quot;The digital age has changed the way law is practiced in some ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin reverberated across the country Sunday from church pulpits to street protests, setting off a conversation about race, crime and how the U.S. justice system handled a racially polarizing killing of a young black man walking in a residential neighborhood in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, D.C. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President offers 'a way to honor' Martin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama said he respected a Florida jury's decision to acquit Zimmerman, but called on the nation to reflect on gun violence. &quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's a way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Churchgoers don hoodies to honor teen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan, congregants at Middle Collegiate Church were encouraged to wear hooded sweatshirts in the memory of Martin. The Rev. Jacqueline Lewis, wearing a pink hoodie, urged peace and told her congregation that Martin Luther King Jr. &quot;would have wanted us to conduct ourselves on the highest plane of dignity.&quot; But, she added, &quot;we're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FLORIDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calm prevails at site of past violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 200 demonstrators marched through downtown Tallahassee carrying signs that said &quot;Racism is Not Dead&quot; and &quot;Who's Next?&quot; But in Miami, the scene of past racial unrest, calm prevailed. &quot;I haven't seen any evidence of problems yet, and hopefully there won't be any,'' said Ed Shohat, a Miami-Dade Community Relations Board . &quot;Frankly, Miami is a ... more mature community than... 25, 30 years ago when we had violent reactions to criminal court verdicts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-guilty verdict in the trial served as a call to action for participants of the 104th NAACP National Convention in Orlando. &quot;Like you, I have a lot of questions as it relates to the verdict and what it means to be young and black in this country,&quot; Sammie J. Dow, national director of the NAACP's Youth and College Division, told about 200 young people gathered from across the country. &quot;If there's ever been a time that we needed to act, that time is now. We need to work, and work like never before, to put laws in place in our local communities to make sure there's not another Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ILLINOIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor: Community must maintain control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 200 people turned out for a noisy but peaceful rally and march in downtown Chicago. Meanwhile, the city's black clergy held news conferences and issued statements calling for calm. Pastor Ira Acree of Greater St. John Bible Church, on Chicago's West Side, said violence would only hurt Chicago already devastated by dozens of shooting deaths this year. &quot;While we cannot control the verdict ... we can control our streets and communities,&quot; Acree said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CALIFORNIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occupy-organized march turns violent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 people marched throughout downtown Oakland, breaking windows, vandalizing cars and buildings with spray paint and starting fires in early morning street protests of Zimmerman's acquittal. The atmosphere was tense, with some marchers attempting to start fights and police dressed in riot gear in front of the police department headquarters. Footage from television helicopters showed protesters trashing a police squad car and a line of police blocking the protesters' path.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WASHINGTON ? The White House says President Barack Obama won't involve himself in decisions by the Justice Department on whether to pursue civil rights charges against George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. White House spokesman Jay Carney says it would be inappropriate for Obama to express an opinion on how the department deals with Zimmerman after the neighborhood watch volunteer's acquittal in the shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old last year. The Justice Department has said it's considering whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case. Critics of Saturday's verdict have called for the Justice Department to step in. Carney would not comment when asked how Obama viewed Florida's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law which was a key element of Zimmerman's defense.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than a year after the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin ? a 17-year-old black teenager ? by neighborhood watch member George Zimmerman, the much publicized trial ended with the jury finding Zimmerman innocent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has since been a heated response from across the nation, prompting the president yesterday to ask the American people to stand by the verdict despite misgivings. &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; he said. &quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; ?Jurors listened attentively and deliberated carefully, and the rule of law must be respected,? notes the editorial board of the Washington Post, as it goes on to note that the true tragedy, no matter the verdict, is that Martin is still dead. ?But the central tragedy of this case ? the death of a 17-year-old boy who had been on a simple errand to get snacks ? remains.? Indeed, tragedy was the key point many brought up, regardless of if they believed in Zimmerman?s guilt or innocence, and many have captured that tragedy in different ways. At Fox News, Erick Erickson quotes scripture: ?My prayers for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, his family, George Zimmerman and his family, and the jury that did its job. ?Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he increases strength. Even youths shall faint and be weary, and young men shall fall exhausted; but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.' ? Isaiah 40:28-31.? Steve Erickson is much less forgiving at the American Prospect, calling the verdict an ?affront to the moral logic that makes up half of justice.? Erickson believes that the entire trial was a shame, and that the state caved into a massive media circus, failing to remove itself from the political spectacle going on outside of the courtroom. ?This was a political trial however much everyone tried to make it otherwise.? And the New York Times editorial board is already looking back on the case and how it will be viewed in the future. ?It may not be possible to consider the case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted Saturday of all charges in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, as anything but a sad commentary on the state of race relations and the battle over gun rights in America today.?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many pastors around the country changed their Sunday sermons to address the wide range of emotions unleashed by the verdict in the Trayvon Martin murder trial. Not long after reports that the jury acquitted shooter George Zimmerman in the death of Martin, a young black teenager, pastors either responded to pleas from their congregations or were moved on their own to address the racially charged issue. The Rev. Tony Lee told the Huffington Post that his phone was &quot;blowing up&quot; with text messages about the verdict late Saturday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realizing that he was going to have to preach in the morning, the pastor began thinking of what he would say to his largely black congregation, the Community of Hope outside of Washington, D.C. Many in the congregation have lost loved ones to gun violence, and are simultaneously grieving and seething from what is being widely viewed in the black community as an injurious miscarriage of justice. &quot;I knew I would be wearing my hoodie while preaching,&quot; Lee said, &quot;and I wrote to all the pastoral staff that hoodies are welcome.&quot; Martin was wearing a hoodie when he got into an altercation with Zimmerman, a Neighborhood Watch volunteer who fatally shot the unarmed 17-year-old in Sanford, Fla. The February 2012 killing unleashed debate across the U.S. over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice that continued in houses of worship on Sunday. Bishop T.D. Jakes of The Potter's House in Dallas told the Christian Post that he received more than 100 calls after the verdict from pastors and friends all over the country. &quot;I think it is an oversimplification of the truth to say this is totally about racism,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that all people should be concerned. All people of all colors should be concerned.&quot; He told his congregation that he normally avoids politics from his pulpit to focus on &quot;the good news of Jesus Christ.&quot; &quot;But I cannot ignore the obligation that I have to you ... it would be disingenuous of me to not tell you quite honestly and quite succinctly that I was stunned, shocked (and) speechless about the outcome of this trial,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe it turned out for you just the way you wanted it to, and that's fine. I am not here to change your mind, but what makes this country great is that I have the right to my opinion, you have the right to your opinion.&quot; Pastors in the Washington, D.C., area told their congregants that ultimate justice lies with God, according to the Washington Post. &quot;Earlier Sunday, hundreds beneath the bright white dome of Foundry United Methodist Church in Dupont heard Nelson Mandela?s prison chaplain, a South African bishop who was in town to give a sermon on hospitality. The Foundry congregation is largely white. ? ?The outcome of the trial in Sanford is a troubling thing, because it?s exposed our addiction to racial division,' said the Rev. Peter Storey. 'We will see what the Holy Spirit does with this painful thing, if it can be turned to God?s providence for healing.? ? Greg Carey, a religion scholar who also blogs for the Huffington Post, wrote that the Zimmerman trial exposes racial divisions that are relevant to the church. &quot;The unity of the church requires that white Christians truly honor the reality of our neighbors' experience. We cannot isolate our spiritual lives from the rest of our experience. We cannot say, 'We love you, but we don't believe your stories.' Shallow reconciliation will not do. We cannot expect to pray with black, Latino/a, or Asian American neighbors while we tolerate the absolute negation of their humanity.&quot; Writing for the Christian Post, psychologist Christena Cleveland said pastors can no longer ignore the cultural differences within their communities. &quot;In order to minister effectively, in order to be neighborly, in order to love across differences well, privileged Christians need to practice standing in solidarity with diverse people.&quot; Email: mbrown@deseretnews.com Twitter: @deseretbrown </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SALT LAKE CITY ? Nearly 33 years ago, Johnnie Mae Martin's teenage son was shot and killed by a serial sniper targeting Jews and blacks in a cross-country killing spree. David Martin, 18, and Ted Fields, 20, died Aug. 20, 1980, in Salt Lake City's Liberty Park.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They drew the sniper's attention because they were black and they were jogging with white women. Joseph Paul Franklin was convicted of killing the two men and violating their civil rights, as well as killings in other states. He was sentenced to six life terms in prison, and in 1997 was put on death row in Missouri for a killing there. Three decades of pain rushed back Saturday night when Johnnie Mae Martin heard the verdict in George Zimmerman's trial for the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the Florida teen killed last year: not guilty. &quot;It's hard,&quot; she said softly, drowned out by more than 150 demonstrators who gathered Monday, carrying signs decrying racism, police brutality and racial profiling. &quot;I know what the Martin family is feeling tonight,&quot; she said, wiping perspiration and tears from her face as she rested in the shade. &quot;Their son will never come home anymore. They won't hear his voice in the house anymore. But he's there in spirit, and I would just like to see all of us come together.&quot; The crowd was diverse, with faces of all ages and colors rallying under the same message. &quot;Justice for Trayvon,&quot; they shouted. &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; Word about the rally spread on social media and from friends, and the crowd lined the sidewalk and cheered as many drivers on State Street honked, waved and shouted support out their car windows. It was 99 degrees downtown, but University of Utah student Kevin Shaw stood silent in the crowd in a black sweatshirt, the hood over his face. &quot;I'm kind of quiet, but this is one way I can quietly show my support,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm here because I'm passionate about justice, and I don't think justice is being done. I hope that our society will wake up a little bit.&quot; Prominent Utah activist Tim DeChristopher was also in attendance, walking with the group as they circled the courthouse and blocked three lanes of traffic in their march down 400 South. DeCristopher declined to comment, referring instead to those who addressed the crowd. The opinion in the crowd was clear. The group attributed the killing to racial profiling, decrying the &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense law and the legal system that acquitted Zimmerman of murder. &quot;George Zimmerman, guilty,&quot; they shouted. &quot;The whole damn system, guilty.&quot; Monday's rally was the latest in a series of demonstrations occurring across the country, some on a grand scale. Darius Gray, a longtime Salt Lake City resident, joined the rally because he believes it is important for Americans and Christians to come together peacefully and &quot;stand for something.&quot; &quot;While the courts made their ruling in Florida, and we must abide by the ruling, an injustice was done,&quot; he said. &quot;All life is valuable, whatever race, ethnicity or gender. We are all children of the same Heavenly Father.&quot; Gray worries that a &quot;pattern of injustice&quot; is continuing in the U.S. against young men of color. &quot;That is troubling,&quot; he said. &quot;What further matters is how we address it, and what we do. ... It's important we approach it in love, with the idea always to have dialogue, meaningful dialogue.&quot; But for Johnnie Mae Martin, race is no longer a question. &quot;When we look at each other, it's just like looking at a beautiful flower garden, a beautiful bouquet,&quot; she said. &quot;My prayers are that we come together, just come united. That's all.&quot; Email: mromero@deseretnews.com Twitter: McKenzieRomero </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said in a statement in which he referred to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges - a verdict that stunned the black community and civil rights groups and spurred largely peaceful and protests in the streets in several U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women accepted that Zimmerman had acted in self-defence when he shot and killed Martin as the teenager walked to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fight ensured during which he shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were at the heart of the campaign for justice for their son, chose not to be in court on Saturday evening and spent Sunday morning in church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman's been acquitted in the state case. The department launched a probe a year ago but stepped aside to allow Florida's prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents are also considering a wrongful-death civil suit against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FEARS were growing today that racially charged protests are set to boil over in cities across America after the acquittal of George Zimmerman for shooting dead unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far angry demonstrations against the verdict have remained largely peaceful. But police fired rubber bullets in Los Angeles last night after protesters started throwing rocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major motorway in the city was also blocked by a rally. Some protesters climbed on the tops of slowly moving cars carrying them down city streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the night wore on, the protests took a more sinister edge without erupting out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland protesters burned American flags. There were a number of arrests after thousands of marchers flooded Times Square in New York and then headed towards Harlem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As dusk fell a modest rally that had begun hours earlier in Union Square grew to a crowd of thousands that snaked through Midtown Manhattan toward Times Square. Demonstrators leaped in front of traffic and chanted &quot;No justice, no peace&quot;. In Chicago, hundreds took to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest grew as demonstrators denounced the acquittal of Zimmerman, the 29-year-old neighbourhoodwatch volunteer who shot dead Trayvon, 17, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claimed Trayvon had attacked him. A six-member all-women jury in Sanford, Florida, found Zimmerman not guilty on counts of second-degree murder and lesser charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors decided that Zimmerman was acting in self defence when he shot the teenager as he walked though the gated apartment complex in Sandford where he was staying temporarily. Allegations of a racist motivation for both the shooting and police failure to initially charge Zimmerman has prompted intense media reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said: &quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection for two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbourhood watch member George Zimmerman killed 17-yearold Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as the unarmed youngster was walking home through a gated community at night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, claimed he fired in self-defence after being attacked by the teenager, while critics branded him a &quot;wannabe cop&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida killing polarised American society down racial lines after police waited six weeks before arresting Zimmerman, with President Barack Obama declaring that if he had a son, &quot;he'd look like Trayvon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and also manslaughter by a jury of six women following a televised trial at a Florida courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict drew jeers from crowds outside the court building, while peaceful protests took place in Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, California, marchers vandalised a police car and tried to start fires in the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon died in Sanford, a town of 54,000 people on the outskirts of Orlando, in February last year. The teenager, who studied aviation and dreamed of becoming a pilot or engineer, died from a single gunshot wound to the heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments before the shooting, Zimmerman, armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, called police to say he had spotted a suspicious figure in the neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Perkins, 55, a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty? &quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to defuse tensions, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson tweeted his despair at the decision, But he added: &quot;Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow anti-racism activist Rev Al Sharpton said the verdict was &quot;a slap in the face to the American people&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Justice failed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin the night he was killed. We should be appalled and outraged, but perhaps not surprised, that it failed him again Saturday night with a verdict setting his killer free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our society considers young black men to be dangerous, interchangeable, expendable, guilty until proven innocent. This is the conversation about race that we desperately need to have -- but probably, as in the past, will try our best to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal was set in motion on Feb. 26, 2012, before Martin's body was cold. When Sanford, Fla., police arrived on the scene, they encountered a grown man who acknowledged killing an unarmed 17-year-old boy. They did not arrest the man or test him for drug or alcohol use. They conducted a less-than-energetic search for forensic evidence. They hardly bothered to look for witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a national outcry forced authorities to investigate the killing seriously. Even after six weeks, evidence was found to justify arresting Zimmerman, charging him with second-degree murder and putting him on trial. But the chance of dispassionately and definitively establishing what happened that night was probably lost. The only complete narrative of what transpired was Zimmerman's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors knew that Zimmerman was an overeager would-be cop, a self-appointed guardian of the neighborhood who carried a loaded gun. They were told that he profiled Martin -- young, black, hooded sweatshirt -- as a criminal. They heard that he stalked Martin despite the advice of a 911 operator; that the stalking led to a confrontation; and that, in the confrontation, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors also knew that Martin was carrying only a bag of candy and a soft drink. They knew that Martin was walking from a 7-Eleven to the home of his father's girlfriend when he noticed a strange man in an SUV following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me, and to many who watched the trial, the fact that Zimmerman recklessly initiated the tragic encounter was enough to establish, at a minimum, guilt of manslaughter. The six women on the jury disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jurors also knew that Martin, at the time of his death, was just three weeks past his 17th birthday. But black boys in this country are not allowed to be children. They are assumed to be men, and to be full of menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if the jury, which included no African-Americans, consciously or unconsciously bought into this racist way of thinking -- there's really no other word. But it hardly matters, because police and prosecutors initially did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption underlying their ho-hum approach to the case was that Zimmerman had the right to self-defense but Martin -- young, male, black -- did not. The assumption was that Zimmerman would fear for his life in a hand-to-hand struggle but Martin -- young, male, black -- would not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone wonders why African-Americans feel so passionately about this case, it's because we know that our 17-year-old sons are boys, not men. It's because we know their adolescent bravura is just that -- an imitation of manhood, not the real thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know how frightened our sons would be, walking home alone on a rainy night and realizing they were being followed. We know how torn they would be between a child's fear and a child's immature idea of manly behavior. We know how they would struggle to decide the right course of action, flight or fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we know that a skinny boy armed only with candy, no matter how big and bad he tries to seem, does not pose a mortal threat to a healthy adult man who outweighs him by 50 pounds and has had martial arts training (even if the lessons were mostly a waste of money). We know that the boy may well have threatened the man's pride, but likely not his life. How many murders-by-sidewalk have you heard of recently? Or ever?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation we need to have is about how black men, even black boys, are denied the right to be young, to be vulnerable, to make mistakes. We need to talk about why, for example, black men are no more likely than white men to smoke marijuana but nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it -- and condemned to a dead-end cycle of incarceration and unemployment. I call this racism. What do you call it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was fighting more than George Zimmerman that night. He was up against prejudices as old as American history, and he never had a chance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial, Katherine Segura began at 3 a.m. Sunday to organize a Jacksonville rally to protest the acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She instantly roused 10 people on social media where she posted the plan. By 10 a.m., 300 had signed on to meet at Hemming Plaza. By the time the 5 p.m. downtown rally was less than an hour old, more than 400 people were there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have people in the state who are not for us,&quot; said the 23-year-old Segura, an organizer with Dream Defenders, which she called a youth-led human rights organization for &quot;black and brown youth in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her voice broke as she addressed the crowd about what happened to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, shot by Zimmerman last year in Sanford. She said racial profiling and oppression occur every day. She called for &quot;a new beginning not only for our people but for all Americans who thirst for a different life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not allow traffic in the block surrounding the plaza and planned to escort marchers to the Duval County Courthouse. Those who attended remained peaceful, and police did not report any incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as speaking out against the verdict that found Zimmerman not guilty in Martin's death, an aim of the rally was to begin building a coalition in Jacksonville to oppose profiling and stand-your-ground laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clipboards were circulated to gather names of people willing to join and participate in a demonstration planned for Tuesday in Tallahassee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; and &quot;End Racial Oppression&quot; placards dotted the crowd among other signs critical of State Attorney Angela Corey, Jacksonville's top prosecutor who was assigned to the case by Gov. Rick Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the Rev. R.L. Gundy, state president for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led the crowd in a refrain calling for her ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to get rid of ...,&quot; he called. &quot;Angela Corey,&quot; they responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mischelle Thornhill, 61, went to Sanford Saturday to be there when the verdict was read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe justice was served,&quot; said the Jacksonville nurse, who said she has a son who is a prosecutor in another state. She said she believes the federal government will step in to address whether Martin's civil rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's over,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said in a statement in which he referred to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges - a verdict that stunned the black community and civil rights groups and spurred largely peaceful protests in the streets in several U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury accepted that Zimmerman acted in self-defence when he shot and killed Martin as the teenager walked to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, had called the police after he spotted Martin at night but ignored orders not to confront the teen, who he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot; A fight ensued during which he shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were at the heart of the campaign for justice for their son, chose not to be in court on Saturday evening and spent Sunday morning in church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said on Twitter: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; - a reference to the Latin phrase &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; known as an expression of betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case. The department launched a probe a year ago but stepped aside to allow Florida's prosecution to proceed. Martin's parents are also considering a wrongful-death civil suit against Zimmerman. Sixteen years ago, O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay $25 million in compensation to Nicole Brown Simpson's family members despite his infamous acquittal in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was walking to his father's house carrying a can of iced tea and a box of Skittles when he was gunned down by Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman claimed he shot the boy in self-defence when Martin began beating on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country still smarting from a painful history of slavery and segregation, many blacks saw overt racism in Zimmerman's focus on a black boy wearing a hoodie as he walked through a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, many argued this weekend, proves the criminal justice system is still inherently biased against black people given Martin, the unarmed slaying victim, was successfully portrayed as the aggressor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country,&quot; said Al Sharpton, the Baptist minister and civil rights activist who help to draw attention to the case after police initially released Zimmerman without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this jury has done is establish a precedent that when you are young and fit a certain profile, you can be committing no crime, just bringing some Skittles and iced tea home to your brother, and be killed and someone can claim self-defence. I think that this is an atrocity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As much as the death of Trayvon Martin itself, Saturday night's verdict in the George Zimmerman trial has prompted a new round of American introspection on the difficult questions of race - questions, it turns out, that Americans have been examining with new energy and fresh urgency in recent months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's because the legal battle over what happened at the Retreat at Twin Lakes in Florida was about more than two men caught in history's crossroads and in its spotlight. It occurred at a time of unusual reflection among Americans of all races and social position, and especially the political and judicial classes that adjudicate tensions nearly five centuries old in North America.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death of Mr. Martin and the trial of Mr. Zimmerman occurred at a sensitive pressure point in the American body politic. They occurred as some Americans believe the centre of the civil-rights agenda, which already had moved to embrace rights of the disabled, was now planted firmly in the soil of the struggle over gay rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They occurred as some Americans - mostly white, but probably not most whites - believe that the decades-long emphasis on black rights has run its course and that the country should declare victory on racial issues. They occurred while other Americans - mostly black but not exclusively so - believe the agenda needs to be widened, to include an unsentimental look at the justice system and the state of the races and to address the achievement gap (weighing heavily against blacks) in elementary and secondary education and the incarceration gap (also weighing heavily against blacks) in the nation's prisons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This difficult American conversation is being conducted in a unique environment: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New developments in voting rights </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only last month the United States Supreme Court ended special standards that several states, mostly in the South, have had to meet for the threshold political experience in American life: voting. Many conservatives, including a high-court majority, feel the robust rates of black suffrage in those states was evidence that the need for such vigilance had passed and that the unusual conditions the Voting Rights Act imposed had outlived their usefulness. At the same time, many liberals and blacks believe the court decision was an abandonment of hard-earned assurances that Americans of all races would have equal access to this fundamental right. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Continuing pressures on historical remedies to racial barriers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many American colleges and businesses continue to employ a form of affirmative action to assure the presence of blacks in the classroom and the workplace. This is consistent with practices dating to the late 1960s and to a more modern practice, with roots in the Bill Clinton era: the celebration of a broader &quot;diversity&quot; - a word that remains an emotional touchstone well into the second decade of the 21st century - in all venues across the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pressures come from lawsuits and from the demands of other groups, including Hispanics and Asians, for spots atop the commanding heights of American life. At the same time, there is a growing feeling that the emphasis for preference in college admissions and business hiring should be economic status, not racial identity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barack Obama in the White House </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seldom has a single presidency had such emotional and symbolic resonance. A black president has been a hardy perennial in American films and novels, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Man</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a popular novel that became a popular 1972 cinema attraction starring James Earl Jones as Douglass Dilman, an accidental (black) president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These novels and films became elements of popular culture primarily because they upended the governing assumptions of American life. Hardly anyone really thought a black politician would actually govern the nation any time soon, or in their lifetimes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why the Obama ascendancy is of such significance. Unanticipated even one election cycle before it occurred, the 2008 election catapulted to the presidency an unknown politician and memoirist only four years out of the Illinois state legislature. It was a substantial geological event in American politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the question remains: Did Mr. Obama's election shift the tectonic plates in American life, or did it reflect shifts in those plates that already had occurred? It is impossible to measure the extent to which Mr. Obama's race is a factor in his political frustration - he was, after all, re-elected by a healthy margin only eight months ago - or in the ferocity of Republican opposition to him and his policies. But it is possible to sense the frustration that some black leaders and black activists feel toward the President, who very rarely mentions racial issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A year after the Civil War ended, the American war poet John Greenleaf Whittier departed from form with &quot;Snow-Bound: A Winter Idyll.&quot; With much of the United States in the grip of remorseless heat and remorseful reflection, it may be worth pausing to reflect on Mr. Whittier's hope that a new generation &quot;[s]hall Freedom's young apostles be&quot; and on his dream that the country, still suffering the wounds of war, might enjoy a new spirit that would &quot;[u]plift the black and white alike.&quot; It's an apt thought for one of the most heated debates, now burning again in one of America's hottest weeks. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DENVER, COLORADO </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager in Florida last year - a case that riveted the United States - has intensified that country's debate over race and has set off calls for the federal government to press civil-rights charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama, in a statement Sunday, called the death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin a tragedy - &quot;not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America.&quot; He urged calm in the wake of the verdict, asking Americans to honour the victim by determining &quot;as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As black parents voiced fears for their sons at emotional rallies nationwide, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called for federal civil-rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman, saying there is reason to believe it was a racially motivated crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Justice, which opened its own probe into Mr. Martin's death last year, issued a statement saying it was continuing to evaluate &quot;whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation.&quot; Mr. Martin's family is also considering bringing a wrongful death civil suit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, encountered Mr. Martin in February last year in a gated neighbourhood in Sanford, Fla. What happened that night remains unclear, but at some point the two tussled and Mr. Zimmerman shot and killed the teenager. The country had watched much of the court proceedings live on television over two weeks, with celebrities and other national figures weighing in on whether racial profiling provoked the shooting or whether it was an act of self defence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a protest in New York's Union Square, one of several sombre, peaceful events across the country on Sunday, hundreds of people chanted &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; and wore black-and-grey stickers with the words, &quot;We are all Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sharon Johnson, a 50-year-old social worker, was among them. She said she had never attended a protest before, but &quot;until you've been there, you'll never understand. Until you experience what it's like to have your son call you and say, 'Mom, I was just pulled over and there are 10 cops surrounding us.' And you say, 'Stay on the phone so I can hear you, I'm on my way.'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers said he was attacked by Mr. Martin. Civil rights activists say Mr. Martin was followed simply because he was young, black and male, leading to the confrontation that ended in his death. The six jurors, all women, heard conflicting testimony about who was the aggressor, and had to weigh that against the provisions of Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law that gives people scope to use deadly force if they fear they are in deadly or grave danger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They acquitted Mr. Zimmerman, a 29-year-old former neighborhood-watch volunteer, on Saturday, the second day of their deliberations. He had faced a second-degree murder charge, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, and the lesser charge of manslaughter, which carries a maximum 30-year sentence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Martin had been visiting his father, who lived in the gated neighbourhood, the night he was killed. He had gone out to buy snacks when Mr. Zimmerman spotted him and called 911 to report seeing a &quot;suspicious person&quot; in the area. There were no witnesses to the shooting. But from the start, it was the subject of widespread outrage, with some calling Mr. Zimmerman a hero protecting his neighbourhood and others attacking him as a gun-slinging vigilante. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanford police, for instance, did not immediately charge Mr. Zimmerman after the shooting, citing the Stand Your Ground laws and his assertion he was attacked by Mr. Martin. Charges were brought after a special prosecutor was named in response to protests and demands from Mr. Martin's family that Mr. Zimmerman be brought to court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a small rally in Denver, Shareef Aleem stood before a crowd of about 100 people at the foot of a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. in central City Park. Protesters wore hooded sweat shirts similar to the one Mr. Martin was wearing when he was shot, and T-shirts with the slogan: &quot;It's not a black or white thing. It's a right or wrong thing.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time he finished speaking to a mixed crowd of blacks and whites, his face was stained with tears. &quot;We need more from you,&quot; he said, addressing the whites in the audience. &quot;If you really stand with us, you need to go back and challenge your family and friends about white supremacy and white privilege.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tonja White Mathews, a lawyer in Florida, said Sunday she had followed the case closely, both &quot;from a parental standpoint and a legal standpoint.&quot; Ms. White Mathews, who is black, said she has often counselled her teenaged son about how to behave should he be stopped by police - to speak clearly, to avoid sudden moves. After hearing the verdict Mr. Martin's death, she said, she thought: &quot;Okay, well, what do we say now? Now we have to worry about any John Doe who thinks we're suspicious.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After his acquittal on murder charges for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman may go to law school to help people wrongly accused of crimes such as himself, close friends told Reuters on Sunday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leanne Benjamin and her husband got to know Mr. Zimmerman in 2004 when he and a black friend opened up an insurance office in a Florida building where Ms. Benjamin worked. They grew close and the couple spent time with him during the trial. Over dinner with Mr. Zimmerman recently, Ms. Benjamin said, he told them he would like to go to law school. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'd like to help other people like me,&quot; she quoted him as telling them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman, an insurance investigator, attended community college and was a credit shy of an associate's degree in criminal justice but was kicked out of school because he posed a danger to the campus, according to family sources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everybody said he was a cop-wannabe but he's interested in law,&quot; Ms. Benjamin said. &quot;He sees it as a potential path forward to help other people like himself.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman's defence attorney Mark O'Mara agreed. &quot;He has a real interest in the law and ... prosecuting appropriately - not like what he got - is something he's very interested in. I will not be surprised if he ends up in criminal law,&quot; Mr. O'Mara said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;His dad was a judge, and he wants to be a prosecutor or a lawyer.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experience shows that re-building life after a major trial may prove difficult, even for those acquitted of headline-making crimes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, said his life would never be the same after the trial, which has forced him to go out in disguise and wear bulletproof vests because of threats to his life. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let it be noted that on Saturday 13 July 2013 it was still deemed legal in the US to chase and then shoot an unarmed young black man dead on his way home from the store because you didn't like the look of him. The death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year was tragic. But in the age of Obama, the acquittal of George Zimmerman at the weekend offers at least that clarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the salient facts in this case were not in dispute. On 26 February 2012, in Sanford, Florida, Martin was on his way home minding his own business armed only with a can of sweet ice tea and a bag of Skittles. Zimmerman pursued him, armed with a 9mm handgun, believing him to be a criminal. Trayvon resisted. They fought. Zimmerman shot him dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who screamed, who was strongest, who called whom what and when and why are all details to warm the heart of a cable news producer with 24 hours to fill. Strip them all away and the truth remains that Trayvon's heart would still be beating if Zimmerman had not chased him down and shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt about who the initial aggressor was here. In court Zimmerman's lawyers claimed self-defence. But the only reason the two interacted at all, physically or otherwise, is because it appears that Zimmerman believed it was his civic duty to apprehend an innocent teenager whose presence alone caused suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So a verdict has been delivered. Zimmerman has been found not guilty of murder and manslaughter. But justice has not been done. Zimmerman's acquittal sparked demonstrations across the country most of which were peaceful. As the news came in late the party of mainly African Americans that I was at in Chicago, turned into an embittered wake. The music stopped. The conversation started. People cried. Referring to slain icons during the civil rights era, the Martin family spokesman, Benjamin Crump, told reporters: &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was this key difference. Back then there was a civil rights movement to take up their case. And channel the frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeals for calm in the wake of such a verdict beg the question what calm can there possibly be in a place where such a verdict is possible? Parents of black boys are not likely to feel calm. Partners of black men are not likely to feel calm. Children with black fathers are not likely to feel calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who now fear violent social disorder must ask themselves whose interests are served by a violent social order in which young black men can be thus slain and discarded?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the acquittal was shameful it was not a shock. It took more than six weeks after Martin's death to arrest Zimmerman and only then after huge pressure both nationally and locally. The case was severely weakened by the fact that while the state brought the prosecution the police who had originally dealt with him had been reluctant to arrest or charge him, providing plenty of scope for reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those who dismissed this as a political trial (a peculiar accusation in the summer that brought Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden) should bear in mind that it was the politics of the gun lobby that made the case controversial in the first place. Charging Zimmerman should have been a no-brainer. They did not originally do so because Florida has a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law (favoured and promoted by the National Rifle Association and its allies) whereby deadly force is permitted if the person &quot;reasonably believes&quot; it is necessary to protect their own life, the life of another or to prevent a forcible felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politics ran through the case like a stick of rock and would have done whether Zimmerman had been arrested or not and found innocent or guilty. So it was a political trial. But it was not a show trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are questions to answer here. Since it was Zimmerman who stalked Martin the question remains, what ground is a young black man entitled to? And on what grounds may he defend himself? What version of events are there for that night in which Martin gets away with his life? Or is it open season on black boys after dark?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's not guilty verdict will be contested for years to come. But he passed judgment on Trayvon that night summarily. &quot;Fucking punks,&quot; Zimmerman told the police dispatcher that night. &quot;These assholes. They always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So true its painful. And so painful it hurts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin nearly went to his grave unnoticed, his death barely recorded among the grim statistics of gun violence involving African American youths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the determination of his parents combined with the amplifying echo-chamber of social media, turned the death into a cause celebre - and a litmus test of justice in America. It put the country's proliferating &quot;stand your ground&quot; gun laws, racial profiling and police incompetence in the dock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 March, Martin's parents launched a petition on change.org, complaining that George Zimmerman had been released without charge and calling on the local district attorney to investigate. The petition went viral, attracting more than 2m signatures within days, a record for the campaigns website. Protests were staged around America, the crowds sporting hoodies and eating Skittles sweets, as Martin had the evening he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Zimmerman's trial was largely stripped of many of these elements. Lawyers appeared to tread carefully around the issues of race, the social backgrounds of the protagonists, and Florida gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Zimmerman suspected Martin of being a criminal because he was black was never suggested in three weeks of testimony; Martin's size, weight, demeanour and hooded top were. Observers of the trial would have been largely oblivious to the wider civil rights and social controversies surrounding it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's largest black advocacy group demanded last night that authorities pursue a federal civil rights case against George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch leader acquitted of the murder of the teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, said the case - in which Zimmerman, who is of mixed white-Hispanic parentage, followed then shot the unarmed black 17-year-old - met the benchmark for an inquiry by the Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the jury in Sanford, Florida, accepted Zimmerman's argument that he acted in self-defence when he shot Martin on 26 February last year, Jealous said the evidence suggested race was a factor and vowed to pursue civil rights charges. &quot;We will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, Barack Obama called for &quot;calm reflection&quot; and acknowledged the case has provoked strong reactions. The president said: &quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence . . . We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this . . . That's the way to honour Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US justice department said last night that it is evaluating whether it has enough evidence to support a prosecution of Zimmerman in federal court after his acquittal in the Florida state court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unanimous verdict came late on Saturday night after more than 16 hours of deliberations by the jury of six women, five white and one Hispanic. Zimmerman, 29, smiled briefly and shook the hands of his lawyers. Martin's parents were not in court to hear the decision. &quot;Even though I am brokenhearted, my faith is unshattered. I will always love my baby Tray,&quot; the victim's father Tracy Martin said in a tweet posted shortly after the verdict. His ex-wife, Martin's mother Sybrina Fulton, said she was in her &quot;darkest hour&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from a few smashed windows and small street fires in Oakland, California, protests around the US against the verdict were largely muted. A number of peaceful rallies and church gatherings were held in Miami, Martin's home town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daryl Parks, the Martins' lawyer, said: &quot;Although we accept the verdict, we find it to be socially illogical . . . No decent thinking person would ever believe that an armed person should ever be allowed to shoot an unarmed child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case, which tapped into national debates about race, civil rights and the proliferation of guns, was decided on several key issues, not least whether Zimmerman acted in self-defence. The neighbourhood watchman did not testify during the three-week trial but his lawyers said Martin was the aggressor during the confrontation, breaking the defendant's nose and smashing his head on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors sought to portray Zimmerman as an angry vigilante who was &quot;fed up&quot; after a run of burglaries at the Retreat at Twin Lakes gated community and who wrongly assumed Martin was a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, the lead defence attorney, said Zimmerman was &quot;very, very happy&quot; with the jury's decision, but was likely to remain in hiding, as he has been since he was freed on bail in June 2012. Family and friends said yesterday he would never be able to live a normal life. &quot;Clearly he's a free man in the eyes of the court, but he's going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; said Robert Zimmerman Jr, George's brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict will almost certainly not mark an end to Zimmerman's legal battles. O'Mara has promised to defend him against the wrongful death suit that will carry a lower burden of proof. Analysts said the case put by the prosecutors had been weak and circumstantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he spotted Martin as he was on his way to buy groceries, then called police to report a &quot;suspicious male&quot;. Martin was walking back to the house of his father's fiancee at the gated community carrying a soft drink and sweets he had bought at a local shop when the two somehow ended up in a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was released without charge on the night of the shooting. He was arrested 44 days later after nationwide protests led to a special prosecutor being appointed to re-examine the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He could face another criminal trial for federal hate crime charges, following complaints by some African American leaders over the decision by prosecutors in the trial not to try to paint Zimmerman as someone who targeted Martin due to his race. &quot;The state's attorney avoided the issue of race, the defence team denied the issue of race - yet racial profiling was obvious from the very beginning,&quot; said civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after the verdict, special prosecutor Angela Corey, who charged Zimmerman, said: &quot;This case has never been about race, nor the right to bear arms . . . But Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was profiled, there's no doubt he was profiled to be a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators condemn George Zimmerman's acquittal as black community leaders call for a civil rights case <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters have taken to the streets in the US as black community leaders demanded that the authorities pursue a federal civil rights case against George Zimmerman, who shot dead Trayvon&nbsp;Martin but was acquitted of the teenager's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles, police fired non-lethal - bean bag - baton rounds after demonstrators threw rocks and batteries at officers. One person was arrested but police emphasised that most of the protesters were peaceful. Streets were closed off in the city, as well as in San Francisco, where people marched to condemn Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, hundreds of protesters marched into Times Square on Sunday night after starting out in Union Square, zigzagging through the streets to avoid police lines. Marchers carried signs and chanted &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; as tourists looked on. Beyonc[#xfffd] called for a moment of silence for Trayvon during a concert in Nashville, Tennessee, while rapper Young Jeezy released a song in Trayvon's memory. Protests have been relatively small in scale so far, easing fears that violent unrest would follow the widespread outrage over the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) - the US's largest black advocacy group - said the case in which Zimmerman, who is of mixed white-Hispanic parentage, followed then shot Trayvon dead met the benchmark for an inquiry by the department of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the jury in Sanford, Florida, accepted Zimmerman's argument that he acted in self-defence when he killed Trayvon on 26 February last year, he was caught on a recording of a call to police using the words &quot;fucking punks&quot; and &quot;these assholes, they always get away&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous said: &quot;When you look at his comments and when you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighbourhood about how they felt especially targeted by him, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous released a statement immediately after Saturday night's not guilty verdict, which followed more than 16 hours of deliberations by the six-strong jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict. We will pursue civil rights charges with the department of justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of stand-your-ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,&quot; the statement said, referring to Florida's self-defence legislation used in Zimmerman's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous said on Sunday that he had spoken to senior members of attorney general Eric Holder's team and expressed hope they would continue the work of FBI investigators last summer who reviewed elements of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will review all that comes out in that, and then they will make a choice about whether or not they will pursue criminal civil rights charges,&quot; Jealous said in a CNN interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is in these types of cases, where there are very serious questions, we know there will be a state phase, there will be a civil phase almost assuredly and then there will be a federal civil rights phase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous added: &quot;We're upset with a situation in this country where as black people, as black parents, it feels so off that our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys, the robbers and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteers who think they're keeping folks safer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, the justice department said it was evaluating whether it had enough evidence to support Zimmerman's prosecution in federal court after his acquittal in the Florida state court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A justice department spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday: &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama said on Sunday that Trayvon's death was a &quot;tragedy&quot; but added that the jury had spoken and its decision should be met with calm reflection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the president said: &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of peaceful rallies and church gatherings were held in Miami, Martin's home town, and in Sanford, one of which was attended by Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton. Trayvon's parents were not in court on Saturday night to hear the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously they were devastated by the verdict itself but they are preparing to move forward,&quot; said Daryl Parks, the family's attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't allow this jury's decision to decide their move tomorrow. They'll move forward to defend the legacy of their son; they won't allow George Zimmerman's bullet to silence Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was always a possibility that this jury could do the unthinkable. Although we accept the verdict, we find it to be socially illogical and that's why so many people have outrage. No decent thinking person would ever believe that an armed person should ever be allowed to shoot an unarmed child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court officials said the six women members of the jury - five of them white and one Hispanic - wanted to protect their right of anonymity and had no immediate plans for media interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial case, which tapped into national debates about race, civil rights and the proliferation of guns, was decided on several key issues, not least whether Zimmerman acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman did not testify during the three-week trial but his lawyers said Trayvon was the aggressor during the fatal confrontation, breaking his nose with &quot;a sucker punch&quot; and smashing his head on a concrete pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors sought to portray Zimmerman as an angry vigilante who was &quot;fed up&quot; after a series of burglaries at the Retreat at Twin Lakes gated community and who wrongly assumed that Trayvon, who was wearing a hooded top, was a criminal who was &quot;up to no good&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the not guilty verdict, Zimmerman will continue to be hounded over the case, members of his family have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; the acquitted man's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr, told CNN.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Child: Film about 2008 shooting of Oscar Grant opens at same time as not guilty verdict in trial of George Zimmerman for killing of unarmed 17-year-old Martin <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sundance prize-winning film about the real-life shooting of a black man by a white policeman has opened on the same weekendas neighbourhood watch leader George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station won the dramatic grand jury prize and dramatic audience awards at Robert Redford's annual celebration of indie film-making in January. The film's plot echoes the events surrounding Martin's death following a late-night encounter with Zimmerman on 26 February last year. Starring The Wire's Michael B Jordan and Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer (The Help) and directed by 27-year-old first time feature film-maker Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale Station details how 22-year-old Oscar Grant was shot and killed by transport policeman Johannes Mehserle at the Fruitvale train station in Oakland, California, in the early hours of New Year's Day, 2009. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident happened after Mehserle and another officer were called to reports of a fight. The policeman's move to restrain Grant and subsequent decision to shoot him in the back were captured by passers-by on mobile phones. Mehserle was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, though not guilty of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, a verdict which sparked protests and small-scale rioting in Oakland. He argued that he had intended to tase Grant, but accidentally shot him after seeing him reach for his waistband. The victim was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station is being released by Harvey Weinstein's Weinstein Company in the US and is tipped for Oscars success next year. Weinstein has produced dozens of awards-season favourites over the past 20 years, including the Oscar-winning civil rights themed drama The Help (for which Spencer win best supporting actress) in 2011 and the forthcoming White House-set political biopic The Butler. Coogler's film achieved the highest per-screen average gross of any movie released in the US this weekend, with a take of $54,000 (&pound;36,000) on limited release at seven cinemas. &quot;Obviously, we had no idea of what would be going on at the time we dated the movie, but it's very topical,&quot; said The Weinstein Company's Erik Lomis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan said he almost cancelled an appearance at a sold-out screening at Los Angeles at the weekend following the news of Zimmerman's acquittal. &quot;My heart hurts so bad right now. I wasn't going to come after I found out about George Zimmerman getting acquitted. It broke me up,&quot; he told an audience at the Regal LA Live cinema. &quot;That's why I think this film means so much, because it keeps happening again and again. [We must] learn how to treat each other better and stop judging one another just because we're different. It's not just a black and white thing, it's a people thing. It's the only way that things are going to take the necessary steps to move in the right direction so things can get better because I don't think it's ever gonna stop, but something's gotta fucking change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian's Xan Brooks described Fruitvale Station as a &quot;quietly gripping debut feature&quot; in which &quot;one has the sense of a man being slowly, surely written back into being&quot; after the film's Cannes screening in May. The film is due to expand to six more American cities on Friday before rolling out across the nation the following weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonc[#xfffd], Jay-Z and A Tribe Called Quest also pay tribute to the 17-year-old shot dead by George Zimmerman <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soul singer Lester Chamberswas allegedly assaulted at a concert on Saturday night, after he dedicated a song to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Hours after George Zimmerman was acquitted for Martin's murder, the leader of the Chambers Brothers was attacked by a woman shouting: &quot;It's all your fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Contra Costa Times, the incident occurred midway through Chambers' performance at the Hayward-Russell City Blues festival, in California. Introducing a cover of Curtis Mayfield's People Get Ready, Chambers said that if Mayfield were still alive, the lyric &quot;there's a train a-comin'&quot; would be changed to &quot;there's a change a-comin'&quot;, in response to Martin's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost immediately Dinalynn Andrews Potter leapt on to the stage - &quot;like an acrobat&quot;, according to Chambers' wife. &quot;She had a crazed look in her eye,&quot; a witness told the Times. &quot;I saw the devil there.&quot; She shoved the singer before anyone else could react; Chambers, 73, was eventually taken to hospital, receiving treatment for &quot;bruised rib muscle and nerve damage&quot;. Andrews Potter, 43, was arrested and charged with suspicion of battery, while Chambers &quot;will be up and running soon&quot;, according to his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many other musicians paid tribute to Martin this weekend, albeit in more peaceful circumstances. Beyonc[#xfffd] took the stage in Nashville 30 minutes after the jury in Florida had returned with its ruling, ending the three-week trial. Under low lights, she asked the audience to &quot;have a moment of silence for Trayvon&quot;. Following a long pause, she performed a solemn rendition of the chorus from I Will Always Love You, then transitioned into her hit Halo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following night, Beyonc[#xfffd]'s husband offered his own homage to the 17-year-old. Jay-Z took a few seconds amid the glitz and thump of his final Wireless festival set, saying, &quot;Rest in peace, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; The rapper had previously criticised the coverage of Zimmerman's trial, complaining to Hot 97 that TV networks were reducing justice to &quot;entertainment&quot;. &quot;CNN is almost like TMZ,&quot; he said. &quot;It's really all for ratings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Wireless's other performers, A Tribe Called Quest, dedicated their entire set to Martin. &quot;I don't want to be a downer but yesterday, in America, we saw a miscarriage of justice,&quot; Q-Tip said on Sunday. &quot;It's not the first time this has happened. Pray for us ... we need help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other musicians responded to the jury's decision over Twitter. &quot;Shit [don't] change, and I may never get to see it do so. I pray 4my kids &amp; yours,&quot; wrote Lil Wayne. &quot;Bullshit!&quot; tweeted Chris Brown. Rihanna called it &quot;the saddest news ever&quot;, while Miley Cyrus said she felt &quot;sick&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black parents hug your sons right tonight. Let them know their value. This ain't a black or white thing this is a wrong and right thing,&quot; wrote Talib Kweli, while Solange Knowles suggested: &quot;We have to somehow turn this anger &amp; pain into peaceful productivity.&quot; But Lupe Fiasco said he accepted the not guilty verdict. &quot;Nobody knows what really happened except Trayvon and Zimmerman,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The justice system relies on reasonable doubt not our emotions ... Emotional reactions to a perceived injustice will get you nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was arrested and charged in April 2012, 44 days after shooting Martin dead. The jury of six women agreed with Zimmerman's contention that he had acted out of self-defence, believing that the hoodie-clad teen was going to kill him. On Saturday, Martin's father said he was &quot;brokenhearted&quot; by the decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the shooting of an unarmed teenager in Florida led to the trial of George Zimmerman and outrage at his acquittal <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 26 February 2012, George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighbourhood watch volunteer of mixed white-Hispanic parentage, shot dead an unarmed black 17-year-old, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman admitted killing Martin but told police he fired in self-defence. He was released without charge that night but was arrested 44 days later following public outcry, including intervention by Barack Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before shooting Trayvon, Zimmerman called 911 to report what he described as Martin's &quot;suspicious behaviour&quot;, telling the operator he looked like he was &quot;up to no good, on drugs or something&quot;. Zimmerman was warned by the operator not to follow the teenager. During the call he used the words &quot;fucking punks&quot; and said: &quot;These assholes, they always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 13 July 2013, Zimmerman was acquitted of murder by the jury of six women, five of whom were white and one Hispanic, in the Florida state court. The jury accepted Zimmerman's contention that he shot Trayvon in self-defence, believing his life to be in immediate danger. He claimed Trayvon had emerged from the darkness to break his nose with a sucker punch and smash his head on a concrete pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case hinged on the conflicting testimony of witnesses as to who was on top of the other during the struggle, and the key issue of whose screams were heard on a recording of a 911 call made by one of Zimmerman's neighbours, which also captured the fatal shot. Martin's mother, father and brother all testified that they were certain it was the teenager who was pleading for his life. Zimmerman's parents and a numbers of friends and neighbours took the stand to insist that it was Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders have expressed outrage at the verdict and demanded that the authorities pursue a federal civil rights case against Zimmerman. In Washington, the justice department said it was evaluating whether it had enough evidence to support Zimmerman's prosecution in federal court. There have been protests across the US but they have been relatively small in scale, easing fears that the verdict would lead to violent unrest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Kay: Guillermo del Toro's apocalyptic adventure can't beat the combined might of Despicable Me and Adam Sandler sequels <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warner Bros' robots v monsters mash-up Pacific Rim arrived in third place at the North American box office this week on an estimated $38.3m. By most standards this would be a decent opening haul for the latest Guillermo del Toro movie. However in these days of engorged budgets and the close attention of a frantic US trade press desperate for headlines on a Sunday, it is simply not good enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pacific Rim reportedly cost around $190m and that is a lot of lolly to recoup, especially when you add as much as $100m in global marketing spend on top of that. This was a big weekend at the box office and the potency of Del Toro's film will have been neutered somewhat by Despicable Me 2 and the No 2 title Grown Ups 2 starring Adam Sandler. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the No 1 and No 2 movies are sequels boasting household names. Pacific Rim is neither: it's hard to launch a new property with little brand awareness and a lack of A-list talent. Despite the opinion of some who say the effects are the real stars these days, you can never underestimate the allure of a celebrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pacific Rim lacks one, with all respect to Charlie Hunnam, who will be familiar to US TV viewers through Sons of Anarchy, and the mesmerising Idris Elba, a renowned TV actor on both sides of the Atlantic who you get the sense could be on the cusp of movie stardom. Maybe his lead role in the upcoming Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, will unlock the vault. Harvey Weinstein has the movie in the US and if he believes Elba has a crack at an Oscar, the British actor could not wish for a more influential advocate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the numbers are the only story the studios care about. On that note, it's worth considering the movie's international performance. Pacific Rim ventured into its first territories outside North America and the results were highly encouraging. Del Toro's tentpole came within a hair's breadth of kicking Despicable Me 2 off its perch, grossing an estimated $53m from a relatively light footprint of 38 markets, compared to the second weekend heroics of Despicable Me 2 on $55.5m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top brass at Warner Bros and their outgoing financing and production partner Legendary Entertainment will take heart from this. Legendary financed most of the movie so we're not talking about a hit to the studio that will be anything like as severe as the one Disney is preparing itself for with The Lone Ranger. It's possible Pacific Rim will become an international hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 72% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes could bode well for North America too if word of mouth gets out and the movie sticks around for a few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aforementioned Harvey Weinstein released the acclaimed drama Fruitvale Station in seven US theatres at the weekend and it grossed an excellent $377,000. Weinstein snapped up the movie following its world premiere at Sundance last January and by eerie coincidence its themes echo those of the Trayvon Martin case that has gripped the US in recent weeks and concluded on Saturday. That could not have been Weinstein's plan when he plotted the release date months ago, but the zeitgeist could fuel further admissions. This quietly devastating movie will play a part in awards season.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration was facing intense pressure on Monday to bring a federal prosecution against George Zimmerman, acquitted of murdering the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, as activists called for a day of action to protests against the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Holder, the US attorney general, said on Monday that he shared concerns about Martin's &quot;tragic, unnecessary death&quot;, and promised that the Department of Justice would renew the federal investigation that it launched last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil right leader the Rev Al Sharpton said vigils would be held in at least 100 cities across the US next Saturday. Zimmerman, meanwhile, could be back in court within a year if Martin's parents follow through with their intention to file a civil suit against him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Martin family, said he would discuss the proposed lawsuit with them in the coming days as they continued to come to terms with Saturday's decision by the jury to acquit Zimmerman of murdering their 17-year-old son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Washington, Holder said the Department of Justice would look carefully at the case. &quot;The Justice Department shares your concern - I share your concern - and, as we first acknowledged last spring, we have opened an investigation into the matter,&quot; Holder told an audience of members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are resolved, as you are, to combat violence involving or directed at young people, to prevent future tragedies and to deal with the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents. And we will never stop working to ensure that - in every case, in every circumstance, and in every community - justice must be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal has placed Holder, the first black attorney general, and Obama, the first black president, in a difficult position. Civil rights campaigners are clamouring for a federal trial in the wake of the weekend acquittal, but the not guilty verdict has undermined the chances of any federal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman is to face new charges under federal law, they would almost certainly be under the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was enacted by the Obama administration in 2009. Federal prosecutors would need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Zimmerman, who is of white and Hispanic origin, wilfully inflicted bodily injury because Martin was black. If found guilty, he could face life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Holder is likely to review the a case as high-profile as this, the investigation will be led by the assistant attorney general for civil rights, Thomas Perez. Former Justice Department officials expressed doubt about the success of a federal prosecution on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Racially motivated cases are very difficult because you need to establish the state of mind of the perpetrator at the time he committed the crime,&quot; said William Yeomans, who was acting assistant attorney general in 2001. &quot;It would require showing that George Zimmerman was motivated by race in this instance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeomans, who was also a chief of staff in the Justice Department, and is now a law professor in Washington, said government prosecutors would have &quot;a very difficult hurdle&quot; to overcome in the case. The department has also traditionally been cautious when bringing federal charges in cases that have already been tried at state level, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder is likely to address the issue in more detail when he gives a speech about gun crime and race in Florida on Tuesday, less than 40 miles from where Martin was shot dead. Holder is speaking at an event organised by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which has expressed outrage at the acquittal of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's family were considering their oprtions in the light of Saturday's verdict. Under Florida's statute of limitations, a civil suit for wrongful death must be filed before the second anniversary of Martin's death on 26 February next year. It carries a much lower burden of proof than the criminal charge, but faces the significant hurdle of the state's stand-your-ground law that allows for the use of deadly force if a person fears their life is in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jasmine Rand, another attorney representing Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, told the Guardian on Monday that they had not yet made a final decision. &quot;I believe they will pursue it, but it's up to them. There are much larger issues at hand such as making sure this doesn't happen again,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are heartbroken by the verdict but at the same time inspired by all the love and support they have received from within the nation and worldwide, and by President Obama's inspiring words yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama issued a statement calling on Americans &quot;to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son&quot; and urging citizens to &quot;widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead defence attorney, said:&nbsp;&quot;If someone believes it's appropriate to sue George Zimmerman, then we will seek and we will get immunity in a civil hearing, and we'll see just how many lawsuits are spawned from this fiasco. We're not quite done yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said on Monday that vigils would be held in at least 100 cities across the US on Saturday. &quot;It's not over. And we are going to make sure it's not over, that's why we're calling people to organise in your city. I don't care if it's 20 people, we want to show the nation that over 100 cities a week later is still demanding justice,&quot; he said in a radio interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's wife Shellie, meanwhile, is likely to be the next member of the family to face court as the Florida state attorney's office pursues a charge of perjury against her. The case was postponed for the duration of her husband's criminal trial and will now be reactivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors claim she lied to the court at her husband's bail hearing last summer when she said the couple was virtually penniless, despite having collected more than $150,000 in public donations from his website.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Cohen: Trayvon Martin would likely still be alive if George Zimmerman didn't have a concealed gun that fateful night <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of us know the specific events that took place on the night of 26 February 2010 in the housing complex Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Florida beyond the fact that a 17-year-old boy named Trayvon&nbsp;Martin ended up dead, shot through the heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's that lack of knowledge - more than perhaps anything else - that explains why George Zimmerman, the man who followed Trayvon in his car, who ignored police dispatch requests to remain in his vehicle, whose actions directly initiated a confrontation and who ended up using deadly force to protect himself walked away from court a free man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Zimmerman killed the only other witness to the shooting, and since the prosecution could not provide an eyewitnesses or ironclad forensic evidence that punctured holes in Zimmerman's claim of self-defense, the jury had little choice but to find him not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here's the one thing we can say with some certainty about what happened that night: if the state of Florida didn't give George Zimmerman legal permission to carry a concealed weapon, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would almost certainly be alive today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the focus on theracial and class-based inequities in the criminal justice system (of which there are many) or the legal perversion of stand-your-ground laws (that dangerously lower the criteria for use of deadly force in self-defense) or the mistakes of the prosecution (of which there appear to be many), it is the presence of a loaded firearm that changed what might have been an unpleasant confrontation into a deadly encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This unfortunately is very much at pace with America's twisted gun culture and the extent to which we have accepted as a society the idea that practically any individual can get access to a firearm, carry it on them in public and use it when they believe their life is in danger - and be justified in their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concealed carry laws, which might strike some as more reminiscent of the Wild West than a civilized society, are not some weird quirk of Florida law. They exist in every state in the country. Indeed, it's great irony that the same month Zimmerman was acquitted, Illinois became the last state in the country to enact one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These laws differ state-by-state, but after years of National Rifle Association (NRA) lobbying, concealed carry licenses are today increasingly issued under a shall issue basis, which means that as long as a state resident meets certain criteria (pdf) (a US citizen, a non-felon, at least 21 years of age, no history of drug or alcohol abuse etc) and have met what are generally fairly loose training requirements, they can have a concealed carry license. In fact, Illinois's new conceal law requires a mere 16 hours of gun safety training, yet that is the most stringent requirement in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the dozen or so states that have a &quot;must issue&quot; requirement, in the 30+ &quot;shall issue&quot; states one doesn't have to show &quot;good cause&quot; for getting a conceal license. In fact, the state is prevented from demonstrating any real discretion in how licenses are provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In of themselves, concealed carry laws represent a dangerous shift in America's gun culture, but what makes them so much more insidious is that at the same time that more and more Americans are being granted the right to carry a concealed weapon, states are also passing stand-your-ground laws that allow individuals - as long as they fear injury or death or even the commission of a &quot;forcible felony&quot; - to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, the stand-your-ground law has allowed drug dealers to avoid jail time; has allowed for the justifiable shooting of unarmed persons; and has been used as an effective defense for those who have initiated a fight, pursued their victim and even shot them while they are on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of these laws not only is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death not surprising, it has the air of inevitability. The very fact that Zimmerman was carrying a gun in a state where the bar on self-defense has been dramatically lowered ensured that any confrontation between the two men had the potential to lead to something far worse than just a disagreement or even a fist-fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, would Zimmerman have gotten out of his car to confront Trayvon in the first place if not for the fact that he was carrying a gun? Was Zimmerman secure in the knowledge that if Trayvon became angry or challenged him he could use his gun to legally defend himself? It seems almost unimaginable, particularly when one considers that a key argument of his defense team was that he was out of shape and unlikely to prevail in a hand-to-hand fight with the young strapping Trayvon. Moreover, Zimmerman's defense relied on the idea that it was Trayvon who initiated the fight that led to his death. Even if we accept that version of events, would Trayvon have confronted Zimmerman if he had known that he was carrying a concealed weapon? Almost certainly not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now gun absolutists will argue - using dubious evidence- that the presence of more guns decreases crime. It protects law-abiding Americans and keeps criminals on their toes, or so the argument goes. As Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said to me, the best research shows that the effects of conceal laws are relatively small - both in reducing and increasing crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this misses the larger issue, which says Webster, is one of shifting social norms on carrying and using a gun in the first place. Increasingly, in large swaths of (particularly red state) America, it is not considered unusual or out of the ordinary to be walking around with a loaded weapon. Indeed, it's become a point of pride says Webster: &quot;I am exercising my rights, I'm not relying on the government to protect myself, my family, my community,&quot; is the new mindset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact is to basically deputize individuals with no training in law enforcement and then give them legal standing to use those guns with the most threadbare of rationales. But why should we assume that ordinary citizens have the same good judgment as those trained in the use of deadly force? Zimmerman is perhaps the best example of this. Even if you believe that the jury verdict in his case was correct, can anyone seriously argue that he exercised good judgment in confronting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, people will get into arguments; they will fight and yell at each other. It's human nature. But with the presence of a concealed weapon it takes what should be a disagreement or at worse fisticuffs into the potential realm of violent death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Webster said to me:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you put more guns in these murky social interactions you will get more dead people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is so bizarre about America's gun culture is that it is largely accepted as fact (both by politicians and the general public) that arming individuals with handguns will protect them against violence and crime, that these guns will be used safely and judiciously, and that such lax rules on gun ownership are a necessary attribute of living in a free society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that none of this is true. Americans die in record numbers from gun violence, in part, because we allow so many of our fellow citizens to purchase, own, carry and use guns in ways that are unbelievably promiscuous and flagrant. The reality is that the surest way to increase your chances - and those of your family members - of dying from gun violence is to own a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that there aren't responsible gun owners. Most are. It's that in order to protect those individuals &quot;freedom&quot; to own and use firearms in extraordinarily broad ways we've put everyone else at risk, including 17-year-olds minding their own business in a Florida neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman case, rather than being an outlier may become the new normal, a harbinger of things to come in an era of loose gun laws, looser legal standards and a population inured to gun violence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a matter of grave concern that Florida's &acirc;EUR~Stand your ground' law seems to apply to some people, but not to others. A jury yesterday dismissed all charges against George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer, who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same week, Marissa Alexander, who had fired warning shots at her abusive husband, was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both defendants used the same defence, the Florida &acirc;EUR~Stand your Ground' law, which is based on the principle that a person may justifiably use force in self-defence when there is reasonable belief of an unlawful threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real danger in the two cases is that they will ignite a furious racial debate across the whole of America since Zimmerman's successful defence may be overshadowed by his white colour and the losing defence of Alexander by her black colour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication of the two cases is that the law works for some (white security guards), but not for others (black abused women), and this is deeply dangerous.</SPAN></P>

After a three-week trial, the six-woman jury found Zimmerman, not guilty in the death of 17-year-old &nbsp;Martin. The case has polarised the US public. Critics contend Zimmerman wrongly suspected Martin of being a criminal because he was black, making it civil rights issue, while gun rights supporters saw Zimmerman as a persecuted hero who was exercising his Second Amendment right to bear arms. Zimmerman's lawyers argued he acted in self-defence on the night of February 26, 2012, when he and Martin met inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford. They accuse civil rights advocates of wrongly injecting the issue of race. President Barack Obama called for calm after Zimmerman's acquittal, saying Martin's death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year and a half of living as a hermit, George Zimmerman emerged from a Florida courthouse a free man, cleared of all charges in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His brother said the former neighbourhood watch volunteer was still processing the reality that he wouldn't serve prison time for the killing, which Mr Zimmerman, 29, has maintained was an act of self-defence. A jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder on Saturday and declined to convict him on a lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, with many critics angry over his acquittal, his freedom will likely be limited. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; Robert Zimmerman Jr said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin's killing in February 2012 unleashed furious debate across the US over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justice. Protesters across the country lashed out against police in the Orlando suburb of Sanford, outraged that it took 44 days for Mr Zimmerman to be arrested. Many, including Mr Martin's parents, claimed Mr Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen. Mr Zimmerman is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six anonymous female jurors - all but one of them white - considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Mr Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They deliberated more than 15 hours over two days before announcing late on Saturday night that they had reached a verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer Mark O'Mara said in August 2012 that Mr Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, had been living &quot;like a hermit&quot; because they feared for their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, police, officials and civil rights leaders urged peace and told protesters not to resort to violence. While defence lawyers said they were thrilled with the outcome, Mr O'Mara suggested Mr Zimmerman's safety would be an ongoing concern. &quot;There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,&quot; Mr O'Mara said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those watching the case reacted strongly when the not-guilty verdict was announced. Mr Martin's mother and father weren't in the courtroom when the verdict was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled &quot;No! No!&quot; upon the announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Perkins, 55, a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder,&quot; Mr Perkins shouted, so angry he shook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said on Twitter: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; - a reference to the Latin phrase &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; known as an expression of betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters had taken to the streets in Florida, Atlanta and San Francisco, among other places, and were mostly peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump acknowledged the disappointment of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's supporters, ranking the teen alongside civil rights heroes Medgar Evers and Emmett Till in the fight for equal justice. However, he said, &quot;for Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin's family maintained the teen wasn't the aggressor, and prosecutors suggested Mr Martin was scared because he was being followed by a stranger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But defence attorneys claimed Mr Martin knocked Mr Zimmerman down and slammed the older man's head against the pavement when Mr Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him as a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighbourhood. Mr Zimmerman assumed Mr Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands, prosecutors said. State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Mr Zimmerman's mindset &quot;fit the bill of second-degree murder&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We charged what we believed we could prove,&quot; Ms Corey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned. &quot;This case has never been about race or the right to bear arms,&quot; Ms Corey said. &quot;We believe this case all along was about boundaries, and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the mentions of race came from witness Rachel Jeantel, the Miami teen who was talking to Martin on the phone moments before he was shot. She testified that he described being followed by a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Jeantel gave some of the trial's most riveting testimony. She said she heard Mr Martin demand, &quot;What are you following me for?&quot; and then yell, &quot;Get off! Get off!&quot; before his mobile phone went dead.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DURHAM - A rally was held at CCB Plaza on Sunday evening that allowed area residents to express their outrage about the not guilty verdict for George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impromptu event drew a diverse crowd that shared a frustration that many said stemmed from the apparent inequality and injustice the not guilty verdict represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brother Ray Eurquhart said that prior to the verdict, many social media sites had called for people to be ready to take action if a not guilty verdict was handed down by the jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So people are taking action,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of us were prepared for a not guilty verdict. We were hoping it wouldn't come to that. You think about your peers being on the jury ... were there any black people? Any working-class people? &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham Minister Paul Scott, founder of the New Righteous Movement, said the concerns were about more than the Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only was Zimmerman on trial,&quot; he said. &quot;All of us were on trial. We're all having our Facebook monitored. We're all having our Twitter monitored. It's an injustice to Trayvon, but it's an injustice to all of us as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury in Zimmerman's trial was composed of six white women, a fact that Pastor John Leak also had a problem with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have yet to see where he was tried by a jury of his peers,&quot; Leak said. &quot;They (jurors) have no concept of what it's like to be an African-American in America. They cannot speak up and properly defend the rights of that (Martin) family or that child (Trayvon).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really a shame that for centuries this country has perpetuated philosophies that flow throughout the system to disenfranchise and even destroy young African-American male lives. This is just another story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd of more than 100 people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See Verdict/Page A2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grew as the event continued, so of whom were drawn to the crowd as they were passing by. One of those people just passing through was Queneia Harley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A teacher from Baltimore, Harley said that once she found out about the rally that she couldn't stay away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a single mother of three kids, two are black sons, in a country where being black ain't never been right. I can't even imagine how she's (Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother) hurting right now,&quot; she said through tears. &quot;My heart aches for her. I am inspired by all of you here today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now's the time to wake up. Now's the time,&quot; Harley continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs in the crowd read: &quot;No Justice. No Peace;&quot; &quot;Justice + Safety 4 Youth of Color;&quot; &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin;&quot; &quot;I am not shocked. I am outraged! No justice. No peace. Only in America;&quot; and a banner that read: &quot;Smash White Supremacy! By any means necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latashia Brown was wearing a black hoodie and holding a sign that read, &quot;Zimmerman pursued Trayvon so how much 'danger' was he in? Not self-defense. Murder.&quot; Brown said she watched the reading of the verdict Saturday night and was very disappointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt it was wrong. It should have been an open and closed case. It makes no sense. If you're in danger, you leave it, you don't follow it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown added that this verdict is about much more than the death of Martin and the freedom of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a statement that the justice system doesn't really care about African-Americans, especially African-American males as a whole. If you go to trial, you won't get justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern High School Band Instructor Leonardo Williams was another rally participant who was passing by and joined the crowd. Accompanied by a 7-year-old African-American male he mentors, Williams said that he is glad he stumbled upon the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's (verdict) awakened so many people who were asleep in our society,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's be sure that we are proactive and reactive. Let's talk and work together despite our race, background, preference and build a better society.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Garfield church Sunday, a deacon wept while praying for the  father of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, saying the slain teenager could have been  one of his three sons.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    An Englewood pastor said he spoke to parents of black teens about  how the world views their children, and how easily their lives can  be cut short. He said the acquittal of George Zimmerman in Martin's  killing proved that the nation needs to have an &quot;honest talk&quot; about  race.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And following a service at a Paterson church, parishioners said  they were concerned about the safety of their young male relatives  and voiced disappointment with the verdict. &quot;The prosecution did  not prove the case,&quot; one parishioner said.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The day after a jury in Sanford, Fla., rendered a not-guilty  verdict in the trial of Zimmerman, a 29-year-old neighborhood watch  volunteer who fatally shot the unarmed 17-year-old after a physical  confrontation, there was no shortage of opinions in North Jersey  about the racially charged case.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Some took their views to the street. A protest at Paterson City  Hall on Sunday attracted more than 150 people, who were urged to  rally through social media. City Councilman Ken McDaniel, one of  several speakers, urged residents to come together and &quot;stop the  senseless killings of one another on our city streets.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    While some residents agreed the verdict was fair, others said it  revealed the disparity in the criminal justice system and ongoing  problems with race relations in America.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;There are two different sets of rules in the judicial system for  blacks and whites,&quot; said Joe White, a 64-year-old Passaic resident  who grew up in Alabama. &quot;It's evident. Go to court. Go sit down  sometime. Go to a white trial and go to a black trial and tell me  what you see. The difference is the way we are judged by the  system, period.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Pastors at traditionally black churches echoed those sentiments  as  they urged their parishioners to depend on their faith in God to  help them cope. The Rev. Calvin McKinney of Calvary Baptist Church  in Garfield said the verdict laid bare a reality that blacks in  America know too well.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;We've never really been treated as full participants in the dreams  of this nation. .... We are still facing harsh and real issues that  relate simply because of the fact of the color of our skin and we  are not welcomed as full participants in the process,&quot; he said in  an interview before Sunday services. &quot;It's not a shock anymore. ...  It's utter disappointment at the way the system is unfolding  itself.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    McKinney drew parallels between the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case and the  December 2011 shooting of black Garfield resident Malik Williams,  19, who was killed by police after fleeing the police station as he  was being processed on an aggravated assault warrant. A grand jury  chose not to indict the two officers who fired the shots. The  mothers of both Martin and Williams  met briefly last year in  Harlem.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;It's the life of an inner-city youth,&quot; McKinney said, &quot;not valued  whatsoever by the majority of the populace and just another  statistic. Malik is a statistic. Trayvon is a statistic. That's  all.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    However, McKinney, in his sermon, urged parishioners to hold strong  to their faith. He told them of a Twitter message sent by Trayvon  Martin's mother in which she expressed love for her son and  gratitude for the public's support, and maintained that her faith  has helped her through the ordeal.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    At the service, Deacon Clayton Barker, who has three sons in their  20s, teared up during opening prayers.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;As a father of three,&quot; he said, pausing, &quot;father God, of three  boys, that could have been our son.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    At Canaan Baptist Church in Paterson, parishioner Denise Hinson  said it's time that the black community -- especially youth -- take  action against racial injustice, not just complain.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I actually felt the injustice; it angers me,&quot; she said. &quot;Let's not  talk to ourselves. Let's talk to someone where it's going to  matter.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The NAACP put up an online petition Sunday calling for the federal  government to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. As of  late Sunday afternoon, the petition had about 500,000 names, said  Anthony Cureton, the NAACP's Bergen County president.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In light of the acquittal, the NAACP also pledged to fight for  removal of &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; laws in every state and to seek the  outlawing of racial profiling, whether from law enforcement or  armed citizens, Cureton said.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Everyone realized that we must mobilize and address these issues,&quot;  he added.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Cureton, an Englewood resident who was in Orlando, Fla., Sunday  attending the group's national convention, said his fellow  delegates were emotional about the verdict handed down Saturday  evening.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;What really hit home was when we looked around the room, pretty  much every parent in the room, you could see their eyes watering,&quot;  he said. &quot;The president [Benjamin Jealous] himself, he broke down  and cried, because he just had a newborn son. Just the thought of  walking the street, thinking you're walking innocently and you have  an encounter such as this, and you have to worry about surviving.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Rev. Vernon Walton, pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in  Englewood, said he spoke to parents of black teens while at a New  York City church on Sunday.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;You can literally be doing what you're supposed to be doing ...  and someone can take your life,&quot; he said. &quot;And a jury said that's  OK.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    He said the verdict proves that the country needs to have an  &quot;honest talk&quot; about race and stereotypes. &quot;No one can say it's not  about race.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Walton, a former Bergen County freeholder, said he has seen whites  &quot;panic,&quot; especially when he's casually dressed. He has seen women  clutch their purses, people lock their car doors and others quickly  close elevator doors as he approached them. &quot;It's very, very real.&quot;  he said.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Others said the Zimmerman verdict has less to do with race and more  with the law.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Miles Feinstein, a prominent Passaic County defense attorney, said  any jury, including one in New Jersey, would have acquitted  Zimmerman based on the evidence. Feinstein said the sequestered  Florida jurors could only consider what was presented to them, and  had to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence proved  guilt.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I think this was a jury who followed the law,&quot; he said. &quot;This  doesn't mean Zimmerman was innocent. It only means that state did  not meet its burden of proof.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    However, Feinstein said there would have been a greater chance of a  hung jury if the case had been tried in New Jersey because there  are 12 jurors in criminal cases here, not six, as in Florida.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    He added that a New Jersey jury might have convicted Zimmerman of  manslaughter because of the state's &quot;retreat doctrine&quot; that  prohibits deadly force during confrontations if a safe escape is an  option. New Jersey's law stands in stark contract with Florida's  &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law, in which people can use deadly force if  they feel their lives are in danger, even when it's possible to  retreat.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    But even the manslaughter charge would have been a challenge for  prosecutors in New Jersey, Hackensack defense attorney Brian Neary  said. Prosecutors would have had to prove that Zimmerman could have  escaped during his altercation with Martin, he said, adding: &quot;It's  an important legal distinction.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    'Happens all the time'   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Several shoppers at Willowbrook Mall in Wayne said that while the  shooting was tragic, the verdict was fair.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;It's hard to assess a person's vulnerability unless you're in that  situation,&quot; said Carmine Pellechio, a retired North Bergen police  sergeant. &quot;It's a tragedy, no doubt about it. It's a tragedy for  his family and it certainly was a trying time for Mr. Zimmerman's  family, I'm sure.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Jose Ramos, a 57-year-old father from Paterson, said he followed  the trial closely and that prosecutors failed to prove their case.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;A lot of people are making it as a racial thing,&quot; he said. &quot;I  don't know if the weapon he chose was the right one, but when you  fear for your life ... you have to do something.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    An elderly West Orange woman, who declined to give her name, also  said that the jury was right to acquit.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;A lot of people said [Zimmerman] shouldn't have been carrying a  gun,&quot; she said. &quot;But suppose he was attacked? He did get head  wounds. I don't know if he was right or he was wrong. But maybe  because the president put his nose into it, and maybe because they  had [the Rev. Al] Sharpton on this, maybe they should have left  things alone.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Brianna Bravo, 20, said she was glued to the case the past few  weeks and felt the prosecution didn't prove the case.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;This case is high profile, but this happens all the time,&quot; she  said, adding that the shooting, if anything, shows that people must  think about how they respond to strangers.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;You don't know other people's state of mind,&quot; she said. &quot;Sometimes  you have to think for other people. It sucks, but that's how it  is.&quot;   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the George Zimmerman trial elicited a heated  response Saturday night from New York Giants wide receiver and  Lyndhurst resident Victor Cruz, who hinted that Zimmerman's life  may be in danger as a result of his acquittal in the slaying of  Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Cruz, a Paterson native who recently signed a $43 million contract,  posted on his Twitter account: &quot;Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman  doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz deleted his tweet, but not before numerous people saved the  image and fanned it across social media.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    He then sent a series of Twitter messages Sunday apologizing for  the statement and expanding on his feelings about the case:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;My tweet last night was my initial interpretation of the reaction  I was reading on Twitter. I immediately realized my tweet was a  mistake and I apologize, that's why I deleted it. I believe  conversation, not confrontation, leads to change and progress.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I never have and never will advocate violence under any  circumstances and I pray that we all encourage and educate each  other,&quot; Cruz continued. &quot;The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is an  unthinkable tragedy that is any parent's worst nightmare. As a  father, I want my daughter to grow up in a country that uses this  tragedy to heal and grow and progress. My prayers continue to go  out to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SIX-WOMAN jury has found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in a racially charged trial that transfixed the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Mr Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict. Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court,'' Judge Deborah Nelson said soon after the decision was read yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict was read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family was grinning broadly as they sat behind him in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of journalists and crowds of demonstrators had gathered outside the courthouse in the dark, awaiting the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the demonstrators were chanting ``no justice, no peace''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury had deliberated for more than 16 hours since Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida and shooting him during an altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers insisted Mr Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin, 17, wrestled him to the ground and started bashing his head into the pavement. Mr Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was also instructed to consider an alternative charge of manslaughter, which carries up to a 30-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February 2012 killing ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders on Friday had called for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``If Zimmerman is convicted, there should not be inappropriate celebrations, because a young man lost his life,'' said veteran activist Jesse Jackson. ``If he is not convicted, we should avoid violence.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top Democrats and civil rights leaders are calling for the Justice Department to examine bringing federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman, after a Florida jury acquitted the 29-year-old neighborhood watchman in the shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Benjamin Jealous, the NAACP president, were among those to call for federal action, as the fallout from the Zimmerman verdict played a prominent role on the main political talk shows on Sunday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous told CNN's &quot;State of the Union&quot; that the NAACP had already spoken to top Justice officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the Justice Department is going to take a look at this,&quot; Reid said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't over with and I think that's good. That's our system. It's gotten better, not worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trial happened, the verdict came in, that does not exhaust the legal options of his family and the bigger community issue of civil rights,&quot; the civil rights activist Al Sharpton said on the same show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even some Democrats appearing on Sunday shows said Attorney General Eric Holder had a tough call when it came to potential federal charges &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; not least because trying Zimmerman after he was found not guilty in Florida could give off at least the appearance of &quot;double jeopardy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response to the verdict also underscored that Washington policymakers might be just as divided on the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case as the country at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Saturday night verdict in Sanford, Fla., prompted protests around the country, and responses that proved that emotions were still raw more than a year after Martin was killed in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several GOP lawmakers and strategists said that, at the very least, the jury made the right call in acquitting Zimmerman. Others, like Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) and Karl Rove, accused President Obama of politicizing the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Democratic side, Rep. Karen Bass (Calif.) called the verdict &quot;devastating.&quot; Former Gov Eliot Spitzer (N.Y.) and Rep. Chaka Fattah (Pa.) said it was a travesty that the killing of an unarmed teenager walking home from a convenience store could go unpunished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those responses also made clear that, even with Saturday's acquittal, the Zimmerman-Martin case will resonate for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to possible federal charges, a lawyer for Martin's family would not rule out a potential civil suit. And, as Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) put it, people in the United States are likely to engage in a separate moral debate over Zimmerman's actions at the same time as the federal government examines whether to bring civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll be talking about this case for a long time to come, because they have to decide on the facts of the case, but there are moral dimensions beyond the case that obviously we have to come to grips with,&quot; Cole said on ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing separately on &quot;Fox News Sunday,&quot; King and Rove said that Democrats had tried to politicize the tragic death of a young man immediately after Martin was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said publicly last year that &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.) wore a hoodie on the House floor similar to the one Martin was wearing on the night he was killed. Both Obama and congressional Democrats have taken a hands-off approach to the case in recent months, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a president to bring us together, not rip us apart,&quot; Rove said. &quot;And I hope the Justice Department does not respond to the ill-advised recommendation of the NAACP to continue this controversy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a Republican, said that the verdict proved that the U.S. judicial system &macr; which he called the best in the world &macr; was color-blind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Martin's family, pushed back on that assertion &macr; responding directly to one of Zimmerman's lawyers, who said after the verdict that his client would have never been charged if he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody in America worries that black men won't be convicted in court,&quot; Crump said on ABC. &quot;I would challenge anybody to go to courts all over America, just sit in the back and watch how the justice system plays out when it comes to black males.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats also called for repealing Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows people who are afraid for their lives greater latitude to respond with deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spitzer, a former state attorney general and prosecutor, agreed with Perry that the U.S. judicial system was the best in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that &quot;the judicial system is not perfect. And in this case it has failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spitzer and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), also a former prosecutor, noted that the Justice Department had a lot to think about it as it mulled federal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's in a very dicey position because there has been a criminal case,&quot; Spitzer said. &quot;Double jeopardy is a fundamental principle in our American judicial system, as it should be. And so it's going to be hard for them to come back at the defendant.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FLORIDA jury found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in a racially charged trial that transfixed the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial raised strong passions among those who believed Zimmerman whose father is white and mother is Peruvian had racially profiled Martin, and those convinced the volunteer watchman acted in self-defence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin, 17, through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation on a rainy night on February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing led to mass marches in several US cities after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing more protests and outbreaks of violence after the verdict, activists and community leaders appealed for calm. Police were out in force in Sanford and the crowd of several hundred gathered outside the courthouse was loud at times, but peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, spontaneous protest marches were staged overnight in US cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Obviously, we are ecstatic with the results. George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defence,'' his lead lawyer Mark O'Mara said after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyer Don West was even more blunt. ``I think the prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers insisted Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin wrestled him to the ground and slammed his head on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict was read. His family grinned broadly as they sat behind him in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Florida's controversial ``Stand Your Ground'' law, people who fear for their lives can use deadly force to defend themselves without having to flee a confrontation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LAPD had already issued a citywide tactical alert Monday night, on the third day of protests following a Florida jury's not-guilty verdict in the Zimmerman case. He had been on trial for killing 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, KCBS/KCAL reportedthat demonstrators were running, biking or skateboarding in the middle of the street at one point. Some climbed on top of vehicles, kicked in windows and knocked over trash cans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rachel Jeantel, the prosecution's controversial star witness in the George Zimmerman trial, thinks the altercation between him and Florida teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was racial,&quot; she said on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight on Monday. &quot;Let's be honest. Racial. If he were white, if Trayvon was white and he had a hoodie on, what would happen?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel was talking with Martin by cell phone moments before he was fatally shot by Zimmerman. Jeantel said she was &quot;disappointed, upset and angry&quot; over Zimmerman's acquittal and said the jury's assessment of the situation was &quot;just B.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel told Morgan that the altercation happened in the early evening, when many people are out walking their dogs or doing other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interview, Morgan played back a recording of a juror's comments to CNN about Jeantel's education level and speech, and she said it made her sad and angry. Jeantel, who is black, said she also had a feeling that the jury would return a not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're white,&quot; she said of the jury at one point. &quot;Well, one Hispanic. But she's stuck in the middle. I had a feeling it was going to be a 'not guilty.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the court did not release the racial makeup of the jury, the panel appeared to reporters covering jury selection to be made up of five white women and a sixth who may be Hispanic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel also described friend Martin as a &quot;calm, chill, loving person&quot; whom she never saw lose his temper. She claimed that the defense attempted to erroneously portray Martin as a &quot;thug.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel's testimony stirred up controversy, with many viewers and the media criticizing her demeanor. The Huffington Post, for example, notedher &quot;at times dismissive, aggressive and seemingly hostile attitude.&quot; Others questioned whether she helped -- or hurt -- the prosecution's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, the fact that she was irritated to be there was a major factor because that's something that is difficult to explain away,&quot; former prosecutor Elura Nanos toldThe Huffington Post last month. &quot;Why wouldn't she want to be there? There's no clear reason why she wouldn't want to be there other than it's just an inconvenience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the criticism lobbied at her speaking skills in recent weeks, Jeantel said she has an underbite that hampers her communication. Asked by Morgan if she'd been bullied because of it, Jeantel replied -- to laughter from the studio audience -- &quot;Look at me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also declined to give her opinion of defense attorney Don West, who some have claimed was condescending toward her on the stand, citing her &quot;Christian&quot; upbringing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on condition of anonymity, the woman said she believes that Martin threw the first punch in their confrontation, which ultimately left Martin dead. (Zimmerman was acquitted of killing the Florida teenager.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman is a man whose heart was in the right place but just got displaced with vandalism in the neighborhoods and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done,&quot; the juror said. &quot;I think he was a little negligible [sic] in doing what he did but his heart was in the right place and it just went terribly wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Cooper if she feels that Zimmerman is guilty of anything, she replied: &quot;I think he's guilty of not using good judgment. When he was in the car and he called 911, he shouldn't have gotten out of that car. But the 911 operator also, when he was talking to him, kind of egged him on. I don't know if it's their policy to tell them what to do, not to get out of the car, to stay in their car. But I think he should have said 'Stay in your car,' not 'Can you see where he's gone.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she believes it is Zimmerman's voice that can be heard screaming for help on the 911 calls. She also thinks her fellow jury members, with the exception of perhaps one, felt the same way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama described the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as &quot;a tragedy&quot; , but called on Americans to accept the acquittal of the teenager's killer, George Zimmerman. In a statement, the President said, &quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests broke out across the US after Mr Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer accused of murdering Trayvon, an unarmed black teenager, was cleared of all charges against him on Saturday. As dawn broke yesterday, protests had been reported inWashington DC, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Francisco. Mr Zimmerman, then 28, killed 17-year-old Trayvon on the 26 February 2012 at The Retreat, a gated community on the outskirts of Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury of six women heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses during the five-week trial. Mr Zimmerman had been charged with second-degree murder, though the jurors were also given the option of convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They chose neither. The verdict implies that Mr Zimmerman acted in self-defence, and was justified under Florida law in using deadly force &quot;to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm&quot; to himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night in question, Mr Zimmerman, was driving through the neighbourhood when he spotted Trayvon wearing a hoodie. The teenager was returning to the nearby house where he was staying with friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman called police claiming Trayvon looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispatcher told him to wait for officers to arrive. &quot;****ing punks,&quot; said Mr Zimmerman. &quot;They always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said Mr Zimmerman left his car to pursue Trayvon on foot. Mr Zimmerman's lawyers claimed Trayvon attacked their client, knocking him to the ground, striking his head and reaching for his gun. The altercation ended with Mr Zimmerman firing a shot that hit Trayvon in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders argued Mr Zimmerman targeted Trayvon because he was black. Civil rights leaders were outraged by the verdict, which the Rev Al Sharpton described as &quot;an atrocity&quot;. Speaking to MSNBC, Mr Sharpton said Mr Zimmerman's acquittal was &quot;a slap in the face to those who believe in justice in this country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q&amp;A: Was it really self-defence? Was Trayvon's race important? Zimmerman's opponents believe he followed Trayvon only because he was a young black man wearing a hooded top in a white neighbourhood. Zimmerman was ruled to have shot Trayvon in selfdefence - cuts and bruises on the back of his head were evidence that the pair had fought, and that was enough for the jury to clear him of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is self-defence a plausible explanation? On recordings of a 911 call made by one of George Zimmerman's neighbours as the pair were fighting, a voice can be heard pleading for help. The prosecution claimed this was Trayvon, begging Zimmerman not to shoot him. The defence said the voice was their client's, that it was Zimmerman in trouble as Trayvon beat him. Neither side proved who was speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the witnesses? The prosecution's case hinged on testimony from Trayvon's friend, Rachel Jeantel, who was on the phone with him not long before he died. She said Trayvon kept complaining that a man was watching him, and that she heard Trayvon tell someone to &quot;get off&quot; before the line went dead. Ms Jeantel, 18, lied about her age when questioned by police, telling detectives she was a minor. This, along with her evident annoyance under cross-examination, appears to have been enough to discredit her, although the prosecution say attitudes towards her were influenced by the colour of her skin. The defence called an expert witness who claimed the angle of the shot that killed Trayvon proved he was on top of Zimmerman, arguing the hole in his sweatshirt indicated it was hanging away from his body, consistent with someone above the gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours, days, perhaps even years before he met his death, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a marked man. Had the judge in the trial of George Zimmerman permitted discussion of racial profiling, the prosecution could have argued that, of all the people who walked through his gated housing community, Zimmerman was looking for certain type of person. And on the night of 26 February he spotted a man that fitted the bill. A man who simply didn't belong there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case would have hinged on the conversation Zimmerman had with the police dispatcher. &quot;They always get away,&quot; he said. He, like so many before him, had already profiled who &quot;they&quot; were. &quot;They&quot; are not just Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Trayvon Martin is part of &quot;they&quot;. &quot;They&quot; are those that arouse suspicion. &quot;They&quot; are those that are deemed to struggle in a society that still uses appearances to dictate whether we could be criminal or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This verdict shows racial profiling is still alive. Martin was young. He was black. He was wearing hip-hop attire. He fitted a profile. So much so that George Zimmerman did not just call the police, but took it upon himself to confront him with a gun on the grounds of criminal suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an even more alarming repetition of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was confronted and shot to death he had no recourse or justice or protection because his confronter was armed - something that asks deep questions about Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws. It is hard not to recall a similar strategy adopted by the Ku Klux Klan to try to instigate a response among those it sought to oppress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must move to learn from this case and make changes happen. The Justice Department must conduct an investigation into the civil rights violations committed against Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. We're going to have to repeal the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law other dangerous &quot;self defence&quot; policies. We're going to have to return to the painfully divisive issue of gun laws, as firearms remain too easily obtainable and able to fall into the wrong hands. We need to pass anti-racial-profiling policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of all we need to look deep within ourselves - to get past our own prejudices of those who we perceive as different because of how they dress, how they walk or the colour of their skin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama yesterday described the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as &quot;a tragedy&quot;, but called on Americans to accept the acquittal of the teenager's killer, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued by the White House, the President acknowledged that passions were running high in the wake of the not guilty verdict. &quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests broke out across the US after Mr Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer accused of murdering Trayvon, an unarmed black teenager, was cleared of all charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities had asked the residents of Sanford, Florida, where the killing and subsequent trial took place, to keep the peace after hearing the verdict on Saturday night in a case that has gripped the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As dawn broke the riots feared by the police had failed to materialise, but peaceful protests had been reported as far afield as Washington, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Francisco. In Los Angeles, around 200 demonstrators gathered for a vigil in one of the city's African-American neighbourhoods, Leimert Park. Police in Oakland, California, said a small crowd took to the streets, with some breaking windows, spraying anti-police graffiti and burning US and California state flags. No arrests were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, then 28, killed 17-year-old Trayvon on the evening of 26 February 2012 at The Retreat, a gated community on the outskirts of Sanford. The jury of six women heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses during the five-week trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman had been charged with second-degree murder, though the jurors were also given the option of convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter. They chose neither. Judge Debra Nelson warned the crowded courtroom that there should be &quot;no outbursts upon the reading of the verdict or afterwards&quot;. Mr Zimmerman appeared emotionless as he was declared not guilty, but smiled as Judge Nelson informed him that he was free to go. The verdict implies that Mr Zimmerman acted in self-defence, and was justified under Florida law in using deadly force &quot;to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm&quot; to himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night in question, Mr Zimmerman, a resident of The Retreat, was driving through the neighbourhood when he spotted Trayvon in the rain wearing a grey hoodie. The teenager had just bought a soft drink and a packet of Skittles at a local convenience store, and was returning to the nearby house where he was staying with friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman called police, claiming Trayvon looked suspicious. The dispatcher told him to wait for officers to arrive. &quot;Fucking punks,&quot; said Mr Zimmerman. &quot;They always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened next may never be clear. Prosecutors said Mr Zimmerman left his car to pursue Trayvon on foot. Mr Zimmerman's lawyers claimed Trayvon confronted and attacked their client, knocking him to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and reaching for his gun. The altercation ended with Mr Zimmerman firing a shot from his 9mm pistol that hit Trayvon in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police declined to charge Mr Zimmerman due to Florida's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law, which allows anyone who considers themselves in danger to take whatever action they deem appropriate to defend themselves. Civil rights leaders argued that the half-Peruvian Mr Zimmerman targeted Trayvon - who had no criminal record - because he was black. A month after the shooting, President Obama addressed the issue, saying: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, on 11 April 2012, the Florida State Attorney Angela Corey charged George Zimmerman with murder. Jurors were asked to decide whether the defendant was a dangerous vigilante or a concerned citizen backed into a corner. They were not helped by the sharply contradictory testimony of witnesses: one, Jonathan Good, told the court he saw Trayvon on top of Mr Zimmerman as the two fought; another, Selma Mora, said Mr Zimmerman had the upper hand before the fatal shot rang out. Even the screams heard on a 911 call remained contentious: the mothers of both the victim and the defendant claimed the cries for help belonged to their son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors did their best to persuade the court Mr Zimmerman had taken the law into his own hands. Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda insisted: &quot;A teenager is dead through no fault of his own. He's dead because another man made an assumption.&quot; Yet the evidence did not prove sufficient to secure a conviction. Mr Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, told the jury Trayvon's death was &quot;a tragedy, but you can't allow sympathy to feed into it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr O'Mara said he was &quot;ecstatic&quot; about the verdict, but that Mr Zimmerman, who has been in hiding and dons a bulletproof vest before venturing outside, would remain &quot;very cautious&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today ??? I'm proud to be an American,&quot; Mr Zimmerman's brother wrote on Twitter following the acquittal. Robert Zimmerman later stirred anger, however, with an appearance on CNN in which he suggested Trayvon had been &quot;looking to procure firearms [and] growing marijuana plants&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders were outraged by the verdict, which the Rev Al Sharpton described as &quot;an atrocity.&quot; Roslyn M Brock, the chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, called on the US Department of Justice to investigate alleged civil rights violations committed against Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Q&amp;A: Was it really self-defence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What were the key points of the case against George Zimmerman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was never in question. What motivated him to do so was. On the night of 26 February last year, Trayvon, 17, was walking through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, when he was spotted by Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman called the police on a non-emergency line, telling them he had spotted someone on the estate and telling the dispatcher: &quot;Fucking punks. These assholes, they always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was Trayvon's race important?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gets to the heart of the controversy. Zimmerman's opponents believe he followed Trayvon only because he was a young black man wearing a hooded top in a predominately white neighbourhood. Zimmerman was ruled to have shot Trayvon in self-defence - cuts and bruises on the back of his head were evidence that the pair had fought, and that was enough for the jury to clear him of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is self-defence a plausible explanation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On recordings of a 911 call made by one of George Zimmerman's neighbours as the pair were fighting, a voice can be heard pleading for help. The prosecution claimed this was Trayvon, begging Zimmerman not to shoot him. The defence said the voice on the tape was in fact their client's, that it was Zimmerman in trouble as Trayvon beat him. Neither side was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt who was speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the witnesses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's case hinged on testimony from Trayvon's friend, Rachel Jeantel, who was on the phone with him not long before he died. She said Trayvon kept complaining that a man was watching him, and that she heard Trayvon tell someone to &quot;get off&quot; before the line went dead. Ms Jeantel, 18, lied about her age in when questioned by police, telling detectives that she was a minor because she &quot;didn't want to get involved&quot;. This, along with her evident annoyance under cross-examination, appears to have been enough to discredit her, although the prosecution again say attitudes towards her were influenced by the colour of her skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence called an expert witness who claimed the angle of the shot that killed Trayvon proved that he was on top of Zimmerman, arguing that the hole in his sweatshirt indicated that it was hanging away from his body, pictured left, consistent with someone who was above the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the police?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police came in for heavy criticism throughout the trial. Sanford police chief Bill Lee allowed Zimmerman to walk free after he shot Trayvon, insisting that there was no evidence to suggest that he had not been acting in self-defence, and invoking the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which permits those in fear for their lives to use deadly force. Zimmerman was eventually arrested six weeks after the shooting, and Lee was subsequently removed from his post and replaced by Cecil Smith, the first African-American to take charge of law enforcement in the area. Police are now attempting to prevent unrest in the wake of the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are good reasons why the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case prompts such unease. One is that Trayvon was an unarmed black teenager and his killer was white and (legally) armed. Another is that the first black president of the United States ventured an early comment, saying that if he had had a son &quot;he would look like Trayvon&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In so saying, Barack Obama pinpointed the truth that a great many white Americans will see a young man up to no good before they see a president's son. For all the civil rights advances over half a century, personified by the black family now residing in the White House, racism remains pernicious and entrenched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To any liberal European - and for many Americans Europeans are by definition liberal - the verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case will be not just troubling, but a travesty. Here was an unarmed juvenile who was killed by an armed vigilante, and the vigilante - George Zimmerman - gets off scot free. There are questions, too, about the time it took for the local police to investigate; about the defence counsel's release of personal details about Trayvon, and the fact that of the six-member, all-female jury, five were white. Lawyers have a far greater say in jury selection in US trials than here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all is so clear-cut. The prosecution, according to many reports, was not well handled, with some witnesses doing themselves no favours. And the defendant was not the wealthy white man that the term &quot;gated community&quot; suggests, but a far from well-off Hispanic whose private estate had a crime problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the verdict leaves the impression not just that it is acceptable for an individual in large parts of the US to take the law into his own hands, but that the life of a young black man is cheap. This incendiary case from central Florida - electorally, a swing district of a swing state - shows how far, despite Mr Obama's election, the US still fails to practise racial equality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury rejected the prosecution's contention that George Zimmerman pursued Trayvon Martin and instigated the fight that led to his death in Florida. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of a Florida man in the shooting death of a black teenager reverberated across church pulpits and angry street protests Sunday, setting off an anguished conversation about race, crime and how an American justice system had handled the racially polarizing case of a young man killed while walking, unarmed, to his father's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders described the failure of the six-person jury to convict George Zimmerman on any counts in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - a thin young man in a sweatshirt returning from a convenience store - as evidence of endemic racism in the American political and judicial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trayvon Benjamin Martin is dead because he and other black boys and men like him are not seen as a person, but a problem,'' the Reverend Raphael G. Warnock, senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, told his congregation on Sunday. Mr. Warnock, in an interview afterward, put the killing in the context of a month in which the Supreme Court had gutted the Voting Rights Act, with its protections for minority voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The last few weeks have been pivotal to the consciousness of black America,'' he said. ''Black men have been stigmatized. We've become a stigmatized mascot for social misery and the canvas on which America projects all of its problems.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P., said there were parallels between Mr. Martin and some of the most iconic names in the tortured American history of racial division. Emmett Till, a black teenager, was murdered in Mississippi in 1915, reportedly after flirting with a white woman. Rodney King, a black construction worker, came to world attention in 1991 when his beating by several Los Angeles police officers after a high-speed car chase was captured on video. The subsequent acquittal of those officers sparked widespread race riots, the worst in the United States since the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is no question that this case has pulled together the current generation of young people of all colors in the way that the Till case did and the way that the Rodney King case did,'' Mr. Jealous said on CNN. ''This case stands out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the immediate aftermath of the Zimmerman verdict, there were spontaneous demonstrations in several black communities, including those in New York, Washington and Oakland, California. There were no reports of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman and his supporters dismissed any racial interpretations of the verdict, arguing - as his lawyers did in court - that as a self-appointed neighborhood watch volunteer he was keeping an eye on Mr. Martin but acted in self-defense as he banged Mr. Zimmerman's head on a sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida law explicitly gives civilians the power to take extraordinary steps to defend themselves when they feel that their lives are in danger, even if they have the option of retreating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already on Sunday there were calls, including from Harry Reid, the U.S. Senate majority leader, for Floridians to re-examine that expansive law. Other critics called for its outright repeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaction to the verdict by an all-woman jury that included no African-Americans suggested that five years after Americans elected their first black president, racial relations remain, in many instances, pitched and polarized, particularly when they involve the justice system and the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders questioned whether Mr. Zimmerman, who is part Hispanic, would have ever been acquitted if he had been a black man and Mr. Martin had been white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury in Sanford, whose members looked drawn and grim as they entered the courtroom with their verdict, rejected the prosecution's contention that Mr. Zimmerman had deliberately pursued Mr. Martin because he assumed the hoodie-clad teenager was a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman said he shot Mr. Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in self-defense after the teenager knocked him to the ground and slammed his head against the sidewalk. In finding him not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the jury agreed that Mr. Zimmerman could have been justified in shooting Mr. Martin because he feared great bodily harm or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jealous of the N.A.A.C.P. said the verdict was especially upsetting for black parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It feels so often that our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys, the robbers and the cops, and the self-appointed community watch volunteers,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Chaka Fattah, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he feared that a dangerous precedent had been set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What the jury is saying is, here's George Zimmerman back, here's his gun back, and what he did was perfectly fine, and he's coming to a neighborhood near you,'' he said on CNN. ''I don't think we've seen the end of this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. Reid and Mr. Jealous indicated that the federal government would pursue the case. The N.A.A.C.P. leader said that he and his staff had received assurances from senior Justice Department officials that the case would be carefully reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Mr. Zimmerman expressed relief, but also concern for his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He's going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,'' Robert Zimmerman Jr., George's brother, said on CNN. ''There are factions, there are groups, there are people that would want to take the law into their own hands.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case began as a seemingly routine homicide but soon evolved into a civil rights cause examining racial profiling and its consequences - though the judge, Debra S. Nelson of Seminole County Court, barred that issue from the courtroom. Mr. Martin was its unlikely catalyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Barack Obama expressed sympathy for Mr. Martin's family in the weeks after the killing as he urged a thorough investigation. ''If I had a son,'' Mr. Obama said, ''he'd look like Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the verdict was read on Saturday, Mr. Zimmerman, 29, smiled slightly. His wife, Shellie, and several of his friends wept, and his parents kissed and embraced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who lost their son a few weeks after his 17th birthday, were not in the courtroom. In a statement released Sunday, their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said that the family was heartbroken and that they thanked people around the world for their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public outcry over the case built up in the weeks after the killing when the police initially decided not to arrest Mr. Zimmerman. Mr. Martin had no criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman was arrested only after civil rights leaders championed the case and demonstrators around the country demanded action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start of the trial, prosecutors faced a difficult task in proving second-degree murder. That charge required Mr. Zimmerman to have evinced a ''depraved mind,'' brimming with ill will, hatred, spite or evil intent, when he shot Mr. Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manslaughter was a lower bar, but because of Florida's laws, prosecutors had to persuade jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Zimmerman did not act in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after three weeks of testimony, the fight between Mr. Martin and Mr. Zimmerman on that rainy night was a muddle. It remained unclear who had started the fight, who screamed for help, and who threw the first punch. There were no eyewitnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense repeatedly showed photographs of Mr. Zimmerman's injuries - a bloody nose and two cuts on his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But prosecutors played up the heart-wrenching narrative of a teenager ''minding his own business'' who was gunned down as he walked home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That child had every right to do what he was doing, walking home,'' said John Guy, a prosecutor in the case. ''That child had every right to be afraid of a strange man following him, first in his car and then on foot. And did that child not have the right to defend himself?''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Injustice: There are biased judges, and then there's Debra Nelson, who's presided over what can only be called a kangaroo court in the George Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bias of Nelson, Florida Circuit Court judge and a lifelong Democrat, in favor of the prosecution and its efforts to railroad Zimmerman as a racist murderer has been palpable throughout the case. Her actions, which have actively aided the state, could poison jurors and factor into future litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her shameful rulings and behavior, therefore, are worth cataloging, and include: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VSuppressing exculpatory evidence recovered from the (double-password-protected) cell phone of Trayvon Martin that reveal deleted texts of the 17-year-old bragging about street-fighting with friends and relatives and photos showing him brandishing guns, gangsta-style. This evidence supports Zimmerman's claim he feared Martin and shot in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VDisallowing Martin's criminal background, including arrests by Miami-Dade school district police for drugs, theft, graffiti and other delinquent behavior. (Martin, in fact, had been suspended from school the week he jumped Zimmerman inside his gated townhouse complex, after police found stolen jewelry and burglary tools inside his backpack.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VExcluding any testimony from audio experts who could definitively ID Zimmerman's voice screaming for help on 911 calls as Martin bashed his head against a concrete sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VAllowing, conversely, the last-minute request of plainly desperate prosecutors to have jurors consider an alternative lesser charge of manslaughter to try to secure some kind of conviction, any kind of punishment, in the complete absence of a sound murder case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VNever sanctioning the prosecution despite Zimmerman's lawyers justifiably filing no fewer than six formal complaints against the state for withholding exculpatory and other evidence from them in violation of discovery rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VYet repeatedly overruling -- at times even reprimanding -- Zimmerman's lawyers when they objected to the underhanded tactics of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VAnd even, in one of the most bizarre interventions by a judge many court watchers have ever observed in a criminal case, directly grilling defendant Zimmerman not once, but three times about his intentions to personally testify -- while scolding his lawyers not to counsel him in what seemed to many to be an attempt by the court to bully him into taking the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeing prosecutors losing the case, Nelson jumped into the ring to give them a direct shot at Zimmerman in a last-ditch attempt to make him look guilty in front of the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even former prosecutors slammed Nelson for her obnoxious impartiality. Andrew C. McCarthy, a former U.S. attorney who has prosecuted major criminal cases, called the trumped-up Zimmerman case a &quot;travesty&quot; of justice from start to finish. Any other judge would have thrown the case out as the garbage it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In presiding over the trial of George Zimmerman, Judge Debra Nelson has made some awful rulings -- none worse than failing to direct a verdict of acquittal on the preposterous second-degree &quot;depraved mind' murder charge,&quot; McCarthy wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state's evidence that Zimmerman had the necessary criminal intent is non-existent, much less sufficient to meet the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt' standard,&quot; he explained. &quot;Compelling evidence, moreover, establishes that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, a claim the state has not come close to refuting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Nelson prevented jurors from hearing all that evidence. Over and over again, she ruled as inadmissible key facts and data that could have reinforced Zimmerman's plea of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson has higher ambitions, having twice applied for open seats on Florida's supreme court. Let's hope for the sake of impartial justice the governor continues to pass her over. She really has no business sitting on any bench.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They attended because &quot;it's not about race, it's about unity among all people - and it's about civil rights for everybody,&quot; Kimyatta Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She looked around at the crowd of some 60 people who had gathered with her Sunday evening in downtown Lancaster's Penn Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who's to say it won't be you, you or you next?&quot; she said, speaking through a bullhorn and pointing to several people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Silence your voice if you accept this - otherwise, rise up and roar like a lion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers held a &quot;Justice For Trayvon Martin&quot; rally in the Fulton Bank quadrant of the square Sunday evening, less than 24 hours after George Zimmerman's murder trial in Florida ended in his acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in his Florida hometown, claimed he shot the teen, who was unarmed, in self-defense as the teen walked through Zimmerman's neighborhood. The slaying sparked a national debate about civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster's peaceful hour-plus rally was just one of many held across the United States on Sunday in the aftermath of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is, an unarmed young man was shot, and his murderer is walking free,&quot; said organizer Nick Martin, 24, of Lancaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are upset with the verdict; we felt it was an unjust verdict, and we came out to express that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several speakers also criticized the acquittal, but they also encouraged listeners to look inside themselves to find ways of ending the prejudice, they said, that ended Martin's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One speaker urged listeners to break down walls that too often exist between people of different colors: &quot;Make friends with someone who doesn't look like you. We don't trust each other because we don't know each other!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters carried signs that read &quot;End Racism, Vigilantism (and) Inequality,&quot; &quot;Zimmerman Killed An Unarmed Child&quot; and &quot;No Justice, No Peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's rally was organized through word of mouth, said Nick Martin, who attends Lancaster's Community Mennonite Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of us heard about the verdict and immediately thought we needed to have a demonstration showing that we're concerned about it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the heat and humidity, several at the rally wore hoodies covering the backs of their heads, showing solidarity with Florida youth Martin, who was wearing a hoodie the night he was shot to death in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of going on the Internet to simply complain about the verdict, Community Mennonite Church lead pastor Susan Gascho-Cooke said she wanted to attend the rally and speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said the youngest speaker, 11-year-old Alex Armstrong of Lancaster, &quot;It could be me, it could be anyone&quot; in Martin's shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams said she would like the U.S. Justice Department to become involved in filing civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster city police said Sunday there were no problems stemming from the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several passing motorists honked in support, and some pedestrians going past yelled their encouragement, although one young man yelled an insult at one of the speakers. But the crowd quickly began to cheer the speaker and encourage her to keep talking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally ended with a man on a piano in the square playing the anthem of the civil rights movement, &quot;We Shall Overcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other rallies were held in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, San Francisco and Tallahassee, where demonstrators carried signs that read &quot;Racism is Not Dead&quot; and &quot;Who's Next?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders urged calm, but in Oakland, Calif., some angry demonstrators broke windows, burned U.S. flags and started street fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most protests were peaceful, however.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands protested in US cities overnight as President Barack Obama appealed for calm following the acquittal in Florida of a man who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. <BR>The angry protests highlight simmering racial tensions after a jury found volunteer watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering 17 year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, AFP reported.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators held noisy rallies in US cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit and Chicago. <BR>At least six people were arrested in Los Angeles early Monday when riot police broke up an &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; in Hollywood near the CNN building. <BR>To the chants of &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; a separate crowd blocked traffic on an important freeway elsewhere in the giant metropolis, local media reported. <BR>Memories are still fresh of the deadly April 1992 riots in Los Angeles, which broke out after a similar racially-tinged trial. <BR>The biggest rally Sunday was in New York City, where several thousand -- including families with children -- marched to Times Square under the watchful eye of police. <BR>Many in the multi-racial crowd brandished signs bearing a portrait of Martin, while some, despite sweltering July heat, wore &quot;hoodie&quot; sweatshirts as the teen did the night he was killed. <BR>&quot;I am appalled,&quot; said Carli VanVoorhis, a 21-year-old hairdresser. <BR>&quot;The man was armed, the kid was not, and the man with the gun got away,&quot; she said. &quot;If we say it was not a racial issue, we would be lying.&quot; <BR>&quot;We have a big problem with race, and another problem is guns,&quot; said protester Rodney Rodriguez. &quot;If Zimmerman didn't have a gun, he couldn't have killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; <BR>Fellow protester Derreck Wilson, 46, said the group had come &quot;to say in a peaceful way why we are angry. We are angry, scared and anxious.&quot; <BR>&quot;It's cathartic,&quot; he said. <BR>&quot;We all have the same desires. I want to be able to have my son to come home,&quot; added Wilson, who came to the protest from the traditionally African-American neighborhood of Harlem. <BR>The case has pitted those who believe that Zimmerman, a 29-year-old Hispanic neighborhood watchman, killed Martin in self-defense, and those who believe it was a murder sparked by racist assumptions. <BR>Obama, the first black US president, urged Americans to step back and accept the trial verdict. <BR>&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; the president said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in the town of Sanford and shooting him during an altercation on the rainy night of February 26, 2012. <BR>The defense successfully argued that Zimmerman fired his handgun in self-defense after the teen wrestled him to the ground and was slamming his head against the pavement. <BR>According to Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, people who fear for their lives can use deadly force to defend themselves without having to flee a confrontation. <BR>&quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this,&quot; Obama said. &quot;As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; <BR>Obama last year spoke emotionally about the case, noting that if he had a son he would &quot;look like Trayvon.&quot; <BR>The racial divide was evident in Sanford pastor Valerie Houston's Sunday sermon. <BR>&quot;Dr (Martin Luther) King (Jr) stated, the daily life of the Negro is still in the basement of the Great Society,&quot; she said. &quot;And today I state, the daily life of my people is still enslaved to a white supremacist society.&quot; <BR>Martin's parents -- father, Tracy, and mother Sybrina Fulton -- asked the public before the verdict to respect the trial outcome, and afterwards gave thanks for the outpouring of support they received over the past year. <BR>Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump declined to say whether they would file a civil lawsuit against Zimmerman, but said &quot;they are going to certainly look at that as an option.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama last night called for &quot;calm reflection&quot;, after a Florida jury's acquittal of neighbourhood watch man George Zimmerman for the murder of unarmed African- American teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin sparked pockets of protests in some major US cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; said Mr Obama. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for action to &quot;stem the tide of gun violence&quot; in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rights activists condemned the Saturday night verdict in a killing that stirred national debate about racial profiling and gripped the public. Protesters took to the streets in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta and Philadelphia to denounce what they saw as the US justice system again failing black Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, who is part Hispanic, shot Martin (17) on February 26th, 2012. He said it was in self-defence after the teenager knocked him down and slammed his head against the ground while he patrolled an area in Sanford, a town of 54,000 residents, not far from Disney World in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a three-week trial in Sanford and 16 hours of deliberations over two days, six female jurors found Mr Zimmerman not guilty of murder or manslaughter at 10pm on Saturday night. They believed his account that he was justified in shooting the teenager because he feared that he was threatened with harm or that his life was in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">InitiatedThe prosecution contented that Mr Zimmerman spotted the hoodie-clad Martin and assumed he was a criminal and that he initiated the fight that led to the shooting with Mr Zimmerman's legally held handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing became a cause c^8l^Ybre for civil rights groups highlighting what they argued were the consequences of racial profiling in American life and generating discussions on race relations in US society, even though the trial judge did not permit arguments around race in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even US president Barack Obama rowed in on the debate following Martin's killing, saying a month after the shooting: &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;, and promising the Martin family that the authorities would &quot;get to the bottom of exactly what happened&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman (29) smiled slightly as the verdict was read, while his wife and several friends wept in court. Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, the parents of the slain teenager, were not in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Annals of history'Benjamin Crump, their attorney, said in a statement released on their behalf that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all,&quot; referring to two notorious racially motivated murders of the 1950s and 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rights activist Al Sharpton, who supported the Martin family during the case, called Mr Zimmerman's acquittal an &quot;atrocity&quot; and &quot;probably one of the worst situations that I have seen&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this jury has done is establish a precedent that when you are young and fit a certain profile, you can be committing no crime . . . and be killed and someone can claim self-defence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Jackson, another prominent rights activist, appealed for calm following the verdict, writing on Twitter: &quot;Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies. Find a way for self construction not destruction in this time of despair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marched peacefullySeveral hundred protesters marched peacefully in downtown San Francisco. Many carried placards with slogans including: &quot;The people say guilty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chicago demonstrators chanted: &quot;No justice, no peace! No racist police!&quot; while protestors also gathered at Times Square in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr Zimmerman has walked free from a second-degree murder charge, he could still face either a civil rights lawsuit or civil suit for damages from the Martin family, similar to the case taken against OJ Simpson after he was acquitted of charges in the 1994 killing of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights group the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People is pressing the US department of justice to file a lawsuit against Mr Zimmerman over a violation of federally protected civil rights, accusing him of racial profiling which led to Martin's shooting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year and a half of living as a hermit, George Zimmerman emerged from a Florida courthouse a free man, cleared of all charges in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His brother said the former neighbourhood watch volunteer was still processing the reality that he would not serve prison time for the killing, which Mr Zimmerman (29) has maintained was an act of self-defence. A jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder late on Saturday night and declined to convict him on a lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, with many critics angry over his acquittal, his freedom will likely be limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; Robert Zimmerman Jr said during an interview on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin's killing in February 2012 unleashed furious debate across the US over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. Protesters across the country lashed out against police in the Orlando suburb of Sanford, outraged that it took 44 days for Mr Zimmerman to be arrested. Many, including Mr Martin's parents, claimed Mr Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen. Mr Zimmerman is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six anonymous female jurors - all but one of them white - considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Mr Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They deliberated more than 15 hours over two days before announcing late on Saturday night that they had reached a verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence attorney Mark O'Mara said in August 2012 that Mr Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, had been living &quot;like a hermit&quot; and weren't working because they feared for their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, police, officials and civil rights leaders urged peace and told protesters not to resort to violence. While defence attorneys said they were thrilled with the outcome, Mr O'Mara suggested Mr Zimmerman's safety would be an ongoing concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,&quot; Mr O'Mara said. &quot;They won't listen to a verdict of not guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those watching the case reacted strongly when the not-guilty verdict was announced. Mr Martin's mother and father weren't in the courtroom when the verdict was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled &quot;No. No.&quot; upon learning of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Perkins, a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder,&quot; Mr Perkins shouted, so angry he shook, looking in the direction of the courthouse. &quot;He ain't getting no probation or nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said simply on Twitter: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; - a reference to the Latin phrase from Shakespeare's Hamlet &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; - an expression of betrayal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AWAY from the courthouse in Florida where George Zimmerman had been cleared of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's murder, an unprecedented operation involving black church and community leaders, federal authorities and Florida police was under way to defuse fears of unrest at the trial's end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some feared that an acquittal of Mr Zimmerman could provoke the sort of riots that followed the not guilty verdicts for the Los Angeles police officers captured on video beating up Rodney King in 1991. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five decades after Martin Luther King''s 'I Have A Dream'' speech and in the fifth year of America''s first black presidency, the agonised soul-searching over the case is a dramatic illustration of America''s tortured relationship with race and history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of Trayvon turned into national controversy after Mr Zimmerman was initially released, unarrested and uncharged, when Sanford police accepted his contention that he had shot the teenager in selfdefence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That decision fuelled feelings of resentment against a white-led police force from the local black community that had long-standing grievances about law enforcement issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson were among the prominent black leaders who descended on Sanford to lead protests, although in the days before the verdict they called for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two key developments helped to avert the threat of unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most notably, Mr Zimmerman was put on trial - the primary demand of the &quot;Justice For Trayvon&quot; protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the city fathers in Sanford also sacked Bill Lee as police chief for his handling of the case and replaced him with Cecil Smith, a northerner from Illinois and the first African-American to head law enforcement in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took office on April 1 but has proved his new mission is no fool''s errand. Mr Smith talked about the challenges he faced in an interview at Sanford''s new police headquarters, which happens to sit in the middle of the city''s historic black neighbourhood of Goldsboro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to change mindsets in the community and in this building,&quot; he said. He has joined officers knocking on doors to ask residents about their concerns, and held public meetings to discuss race relations and the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he has also made it clear that if there are white officers with entrenched racist attitudes, he will fire them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very sad if it takes a tragedy like the death of Trayvon, to change things, but if ... we can build some trust between this department and the community, then some good will have come out of this situation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Saturday''s verdict, police, officials and civil rights leaders called for peace and told protesters not to resort to violence. Defence lawyer Mark O''Mara suggested Mr Zimmerman''s safety would be an ongoing concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those watching the case reacted strongly when the not guilty verdict was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Perkins (55), a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot; Protesters had taken to the streets late on Saturday and into yesterday morning in Florida, Atlanta and San Francisco, among other places. The demonstrators seemed to largely heed the advice of officials and others who urged them not to resort to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin family lawyer Benjamin Crump acknowledged the disappointment of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin''s supporters, but he said, &quot;for Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon''s family maintained the teen wasn''t the aggressor, and prosecutors suggested Martin was scared because he was being followed by a stranger. Defence attorneys, however, claimed Trayvon knocked Mr Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man''s head against the sidewalk when Mr Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Mr Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him as a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighbourhood committed primarily by young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman also had some supporters outside the courthouse, including Cindy Lenzen (50), of Casslebury, and her brother, 52-year-old Chris Bay. Ms Lenzen and Mr Bay - who are white - called the entire case &quot;a tragedy,&quot; especially for Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It''s a tragedy that he''s going to suffer for the rest of his life,&quot; Mr Bay said. &quot;No one wins either way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors had to sort out clashing testimony from 56 witnesses in all, including police, neighbours, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, witnesses who got fleeting glimpses of the fight in the darkness gave differing accounts of who was on top. And Trayvon''s parents and Mr Zimmerman''s parents both claimed that the person heard screaming for help in the background of a neighbour''s 911 call was their son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To secure a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury that Mr Zimmerman acted with a &quot;depraved&quot; state of mind - that is, with ill will, hatred or spite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said he demonstrated that when he muttered, &quot;F****** punks. These a*******. They always get away,&quot; during a call to police as he watched Trayvon walk through his neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury only that Mr Zimmerman killed without lawful justification. (&copy; Daily Telegraph, London)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTS broke out across the US after George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer accused of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, was cleared of all charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities had asked the residents of Sanford, Florida - where the killing and subsequent trial took place - to keep the peace after hearing the verdict on Saturday night in a case that has gripped the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As dawn broke the riots feared by the police had failed to materialise, but peaceful protests had been reported as far afield as Washington, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta and San Francisco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles, around 200 demonstrators gathered for a vigil in one of the city''s African-American neighbourhoods, Leimert Park. Police in Oakland, California, said a small crowd took to the streets, with some breaking windows, spraying anti-police graffiti and burning US and California state flags. No arrests were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dejected Last night the president said in a White House statement that Trayvon''s death was a tragedy, &quot;not just for his family, or for anSy one community, but for America&quot;, but called for calm amid fears that &quot;passions may be running even higher&quot; following the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we''re doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, outside the courthouse in Florida, about 100 protesters punched the air defiantly as they heard the verdict, chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; But an hour or so later, the dejected crowd began to disperse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman (then 28) killed 17-year-old Trayvon on the evening of February 26, 2012, at The Retreat, a gated community on the outskirts of Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury of six women and six men heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses during the five-week trial. They returned their verdict following 16 hours of deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman had been charged with second-degree murder, though the jurors were also given the option of convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter. They chose neither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson warned the crowded courtroom that there should be &quot;no outbursts upon the reading of the verdict or afterwards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman appeared emotionless as he was declared not guilty, but smiled as the judge informed him that he was free to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict implies that Mr Zimmerman acted in selfdefence, and was justified under Florida law in using deadly force &quot;to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm&quot; to himself. On the night in question, Mr Zimmerman, a resident of The Retreat, was driving through the neighbourhood when he spotted Trayvon in the rain wearing a grey hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspicious The teenager had just bought a soft drink and a packet of Skittles at a local convenience store, and was returning to the nearby house where he was staying with friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman called police claiming Trayvon looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispatcher told him to wait for officers to arrive. &quot;F**king punks,&quot; said Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened next may never be clear. Prosecutors said Mr Zimmerman left his car to pursue Trayvon on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  Mr Zimmerman's lawyers claimed Trayvon confronted and attacked their client, knocking him to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and reaching for his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The altercation ended with Mr Zimmerman firing a shot from his 9mm pistol that hit Trayvon in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police declined to charge Mr Zimmerman due to Florida''s 'stand-your-ground' law, which allows anyone who considers themselves in danger to take whatever action they deem appropriate to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders argued that the half-Peruvian Mr Zimmerman targeted Trayvon - who had no criminal record - because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month after the shooting, President Obama addressed the issue, saying: &quot;If I had a son, he''d look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, on April 11, 2012, the Florida state attorney Angela Corey charged Mr Zimmerman with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his trial, jurors were asked to decide whether the defendant was a dangerous vigilante or a concerned citizen backed into a corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were not helped by the sharply contradictory testimony of witnesses: one, Jonathan Good, told the court he saw Trayvon on top of Mr Zimmerman as the two fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another, Selma Mora, said Mr Zimmerman had the upper hand before the fatal shot rang out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tragedy Prosecutors did their best to persuade the court Mr Zimmerman had taken the law into his own hands. Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda insisted: &quot;A teenager is dead through no fault of his own. He''s dead because another man made an assumption.&quot; Mr Zimmerman''s lawyer, Mark O''Mara, told the jury Trayvon''s death was &quot;a tragedy, but you can''t allow sympathy to feed into it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil-rights leaders were outraged by the verdict, which the Rev Al Sharpton described as &quot;an atrocity&quot;. Roslyn M Brock, the chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, called on the US Department of Justice to investigate alleged civilrights violations committed against Trayvon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said in a statement in which he referred to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges - a verdict that stunned the black community and civil rights groups and spurred largely peaceful and protests in the streets in several U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women accepted that Zimmerman had acted in self-defence when he shot and killed Martin as the teenager walked to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot; A fight ensued, during which he shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were at the heart of the campaign for justice for their son, chose not to be in court on Saturday evening and spent Sunday morning in church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said on Twitter: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; The Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman's been acquitted in the state case. The department launched a probe a year ago but stepped aside to allow Florida's prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents are also considering a wrongfuldeath civil suit against Zimmerman. Sixteen years ago, O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay $25 million US in compensation to Nicole Brown Simpson's family members despite his infamous acquittal in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was walking to his father's house carrying a can of iced tea and a box of Skittles when he was gunned down by Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman claimed he shot the boy in self-defence when Martin attacked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country still smarting from a painful history of slavery and segregation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many saw overt racism in Zimmerman's focus on a black boy wearing a hoodie as he walked through a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, many argued this weekend, proves the criminal justice system is still inherently biased against black people given Martin, the unarmed slaying victim, was successfully portrayed as the aggressor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country,&quot; said Rev. Al Sharpton, the Baptist minister and civil rights activist who helped to draw attention to the case after police initially released Zimmerman without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What this jury has done is establish a precedent that when you are young and fit a certain profile, you can be committing no crime, just bringing some Skittles and iced tea home to your brother,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and be killed and someone can claim self-defence. I think that this is an atrocity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP, said Sunday, &quot;There may be a civil action brought by the family, but there should definitely be criminal charges brought by (the Department of Justice).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we have asked DOJ to continue their investigation. They are indeed continuing, and we hope that once everything that's happened that can happen here in Florida ... that the DOJ will act and will hold Mr. Zimmerman accountable for what he has done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to level a hate crime charge, Jealous added, federal investigators need to &quot;show that race was a factor in his decision-making. And there seems to be plenty of evidence that suggests that race may have been a factor. He called 911 a lot about young black men that he suspected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of being dangerous.&quot; In a New York City church, one pastor wore a pink hoodie in memory of Martin on Sunday. The boy was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Jacqueline Lewis urged her congregation to remain peaceful, reminding them that Martin Luther King Jr. &quot;would have wanted us to conduct ourselves on the highest plane of dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added: &quot;We're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Zimmerman Jr., the gunman's brother, said the former neighbourhood watch volunteer was still processing the reality that he wouldn't serve prison time for the killing, which Zimmerman, 29, maintained was an act of self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, with many critics angry over his acquittal, his freedom may be limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; Robert Zimmerman Jr. said during an interview on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats called the outcome a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans felt differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our justice system is colour-blind,&quot; Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said on CNN. &quot;You had two very capable teams laying out the evidence and the jury made the decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">With Criminal Case Closed, Justice Department Will Restart Hate Crime Inquiry</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">610  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said Sunday that it was restarting its investigation into the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin to consider possible separate hate crime charges against George Zimmerman. <BR>Mr. Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who shot Mr. Martin, was acquitted of all charges by a jury late Saturday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federal inquiry, which was started shortly after the shooting last year but had been delayed while the state criminal trial in Florida was under way, was being restarted after civil rights leaders called on the Justice Department to re-examine the case. The leaders said Sunday that they remained convinced that the shooting had a racial element. Mr. Martin, 17, was black. <BR>&quot;There is a pattern of George Zimmerman making dozens of calls to 911 over several years, frequently about young men of color,&quot; Benjamin T. Jealous, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., said in an interview on Sunday. Mr. Zimmerman and his family have defended the shooting as an act of self-defense. <BR>In a statement on Sunday, the Justice Department said that now that the state criminal trial was over, it would continue its examination of the circumstances in the shooting. &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction,&quot; the statement said. <BR>The department sets a high bar for such a prosecution. Three former Justice Department officials who once worked in the department's Civil Rights Division, which is handling the inquiry, said Sunday that the federal government must clear a series of difficult legal hurdles before it could move to indict Mr. Zimmerman. <BR>&quot;It is not enough if it's just a fight that escalated,&quot; said Samuel Bagenstos, who until 2011 served as the principal deputy assistant attorney general in the division. &quot;The government has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant acted willfully with a seriously culpable state of mind&quot; to violate Mr. Martin's civil rights. <BR>Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. hinted at those challenges last year. <BR>&quot;We have to prove the highest standard in the law,&quot; Mr. Holder said at a news conference in April 2012. &quot;Something that was reckless, that was negligent, does not meet that standard. We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with the requisite state of mind.&quot; <BR>Criminal charges under federal hate crime law have increased significantly during the Obama administration. Between 2009 and 2012, the Justice Department prosecuted 29 percent more such cases than in the previous three fiscal years. Last month in Seattle, for example, Jamie Larson, 49, pleaded guilty to federal hate crime charges that he beat a cabdriver, who was from India and was wearing a turban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase is in part because of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, enacted in 2009, which removed a requirement that a victim had to be engaged in a federally protected activity, like voting or going to school. <BR>But the Obama administration's Justice Department has been cautious in its use of the expanded law. In 2010, for example, it turned down calls by civil rights leaders to file charges in New York City in the 2006 death of Sean Bell, a 23-year-old black man who was fatally shot by police officers outside a Queens club just hours before he was to be married. <BR>&quot;There aren't that many of these cases, and it is not because the government is not being vigilant,&quot; said William R. Yeomans, a former chief of staff in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. &quot;It is very difficult to establish a defendant's state of mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With chants and prayers, sermons and signs, outrage over a jury's decision to clear George Zimmerman in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager poured from street protests and church pulpits Sunday amid calls for federal civil-rights charges to be filed in the case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations large and small broke out across the country - ranging from a few dozen people to several hundred - in support of the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as protesters decried the not guilty verdict as a miscarriage of justice. <BR>The NAACP and protesters called for federal civil- rights charges against Zimmerman, who was acquitted Saturday in Martin's February 2012 shooting death, which unleashed a national debate over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. <BR>The Justice Department said it is looking into the case to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case. Meanwhile, President Obama and religious and civil rights leaders urged calm in hopes of ensuring peaceful demonstrations in the wake of a case that became an emotional flash point. <BR>At Manhattan's Middle Collegiate Church, many congregants wore hooded sweatshirts - the same thing Martin was wearing the night he was shot. Hoodie-clad Jessica Nacinovich said she could feel only disappointment and sadness over the verdict. <BR>&quot;I'm sure jurors did what they felt was right in accordance with the law, but maybe the law is wrong, maybe society is wrong; there's a lot that needs fixing,&quot; she said. <BR>The Rev. Jacqueline Lewis, wearing a pink hoodie, urged a peaceful but vocal response. <BR>&quot;We're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;We'll aim our fight for justice against the ease with which people can get firearms in this country.&quot; <BR>At a youth service in Sanford, Fla., where the trial was held, teens wearing shirts displaying Martin's picture wiped away tears during a sermon at the St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church. <BR>About 200 people turned out for a rally and march in downtown Chicago, saying the verdict was symbolic of lingering racism in the United States. Seventy-three-year-old Maya Miller said the case reminded her of the 1955 slaying of Emmitt Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago who was murdered by a group of white men while visiting Mississippi. Till's killing galvanized the civil-rights movement. <BR>&quot;Fifty-eight years and nothing's changed,&quot; Miller said, pausing to join a chant of &quot;Justice for Trayvon, not one more.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters also gathered in Miami, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., along with a host of other cities. <BR>Hours after the verdict Saturday night, demonstrators gathered on U Street in Washington, chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; One protester carried a sign that read, &quot;Stop criminalizing black men.&quot; <BR>In Miami, more than 200 people gathered for a vigil. &quot;You can't justify murder,&quot; read one poster. Another read &quot;Don't worry about more riots. Worry about more Zimmermans.&quot; <BR>Carol Reitner, 76, of Miami, said she heard about the vigil through an announcement at her church Sunday morning. &quot;I was really devastated. It's really hard to believe that someone can take the life of someone else and walk out of court free,&quot; she said. <BR>In Manhattan's Union Square, hundreds of people gathered to voice their passions over the verdict, hoisting placards with images of Martin. <BR>Some tempered their anger, saying they didn't contest the jury's decision based on the legal issues involved. <BR>But &quot;while the verdict may be legal, a system that doesn't take into account what happened is a broken legal system,&quot; said Jennifer Lue, 24. <BR>Civil rights leaders, including the Reverands Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, urged peace in the wake of the verdict. Jackson said the legal system &quot;failed justice,&quot; but violence isn't the answer. <BR>But not all the protesters heeded those calls in the protests that broke out immediately after the verdict. <BR>In Oakland, Calif., some angry demonstrators broke windows, burned U.S. flags and started street fires. Some marchers also vandalized a police squad car and used spray paint to scrawl anti-police graffiti on roads and Alameda County's Davidson courthouse. In Los Angeles, police said a crowd of about 100 protesters surrounded an officer and eventually had to be dispersed by officers firing beanbag rounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">903  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Florida's African-American communities, reactions ran strong and deep on Sunday to an acquittal in the killing of teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;<BR>But their anger and disappointment was expressed not in street demonstrations or noisy protests but in the pews and pulpits of churches, where many called for changes in the justice system.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict reminds us that as a people we lean on the law, trust the law, embrace the law, but it seems the law doesn't embrace us,&quot; said the Rev. Arthur Jackson III, of Antioch Missionary Baptist Church of Miami Gardens, where the 17-year-old often worshiped with his mother Sybrina Fulton. &quot;We will not allow Trayvon's death to be a death in vain.&quot; <BR>Fulton was not present Sunday, but Jackson said he talked to her by phone early that morning. <BR>&quot;They are upset,&quot; he told a packed sanctuary of 1,300 worshiper's. &quot;They are very heartbroken over losing a child, as any parent would be. But she has faith in God.&quot; <BR>In the wake of the not guilty verdict delivered late Saturday in the Sanford trial of neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, the changes that Jackson and others spoke of were hard to pinpoint. <BR>Although the state's controversial Stand Your Ground law was not invoked in Zimmerman's defense, that statute and the widespread perception that the 29-year-old had racially profiled Martin helped heighten the profile of the nationally-televised case. <BR>&quot;The verdict is not the end, but the beginning of a necessary discussion about the intersection of race, racial profiling, and the law,&quot; Yolanda Strader, president of the Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. Bar Association, a group representing black lawyers in Miami, said in a statement. <BR>In Boynton Beach, Nathaniel Robinson, pastor of Greater Saint Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church, urged his congregation to do more than hold street protests to change the legal system. <BR>&quot;Holding up a picket sign doesn't do much,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to partner with different service organizations that are already on the move and petition for a civil suit.&quot; <BR>A student-run group called Dream Defenders, which advocates non-violent civil disobedience, issued a call for continuing public protest, without announcing any planned actions. <BR>&quot;We must hold on to our anger in the face of the injustice and let the feelings of love for our community push us forward in fixing our broken society,&quot; the group said. <BR>There was anger over the verdict, for sure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am trying to put it in God's hands,&quot; said Evelyn Johnson, 69. &quot;But Zimmerman got away with murder. And Trayvon is at peace.&quot;  <BR>Despite the frustration felt by many, the calm response to the decision was lauded, including by Martin's relatives.  <BR>&quot;This is a tragedy,&quot; said Trayvon's cousin Iesha Felton, 35, after one of the three services at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church. &quot;But there is no reason this should happen to any other family. Young people, stay strong in your faith. Be peaceful.&quot;  <BR>That message was apparently heeded. Law enforcement agencies reported no outbreaks of violence in response to the verdict.  <BR>In Fort Lauderdale, Pastor Rasheed Baaith of Christ Resurrection Community Church urged worshipers to turn the other cheek.  <BR>&quot;We pray that [the Lord] lifts this deep hurt off from us,&quot; he said in his sermon. &quot;While I'm tremendously disappointed and in pain for Trayvon's parents, I'm also praying for Zimmerman.&quot;  <BR>Church member Rickey Bradwell, 59, said his faith has kept him grounded despite a verdict he believes is unjust.  <BR>&quot;It was a bad decision because there should be some type of justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, whether it be a murder or manslaughter conviction,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of negativity and violence was expected, but we are a different folk today. We can embrace peace.&quot; he said.  <BR>Miami Gardens Mayor Oliver Gilbert said the verdict disappointed many in his community. &quot;We're all sad,&quot; he said. &quot;Seventeen months ago Trayvon was killed and we believe the verdict did not go the way we wanted it to.&quot;  <BR>He said the expectation of violence voiced by many &quot;were the same expectations Zimmerman had that night&quot; he saw Trayvon walking the neighborhood.  <BR>Laniah Smith, 15, of Christ Resurrection Community Church, said an eruption of violence would only have deepened the anguish.  <BR>&quot;I think it's good people didn't waste their time being violent, because even if they did, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still not be here,&quot; she said.  <BR>At the New Jerusalem First Baptist Church in Hollywood, the Rev. James Bernand noted that being angry is natural, but it's important to channel it through non-violence.  <BR>&quot;We cannot sit back and do nothing ... We need to fight back, but we need to do it in a constructive way not a destructive way ... If there is a peaceful constructive protest, we need to join it,&quot; he said.  <BR>Contributing to this report were staff writers Wayne Roustan and Melhor Leonor and researcher Barbara Hijek.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace rally planned  <BR>What: Community Peace Rally, in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.  <BR>Where: New Mount Olive Baptist Church, 400 NW 9th Ave., Fort Lauderdale.  <BR>When: Tuesday, 7 p.m.  <BR>Who: Senior Pastor Marcus Davidson, elected officials and law enforcement officers.  <BR>Why: &quot;This rally is not for the sake of bashing George Zimmerman or any vigilante justice. This rally is for the sake of understanding...we must ensure that peace prevails among our people and our community.&quot; - Rev. Davidson</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1107  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Saturday's verdict acquitting George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin - and even before then - there has been no shortage of excellent analysis on the reasons behind the verdict, implicating everything from lack of evidence to inherent racism in the jurors to inherent racism in our criminal justice system. &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>I give you three of my favorites: one from Emily Bazelon at Slate, in which she discusses the state of the law in Florida; another from Justin Peters, also at Slate, written before the verdict and articulately laying out the truly difficult burden facing the prosecutors; and finally a trenchant and wide-ranging reflection from Ta-Nehisi Coates at The Atlantic. &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Last year, we wrote about Texas' own Stand Your Ground law. &nbsp;As we wrote last year, Texas' version of the law - and, we note, it is not an exact match - is codified at &sect;9.31, et seq. of the Texas Penal Code. &nbsp;The law as we know it was first passed in 1973, with the most recent amendments to it being enacted by the legislature in 2007. &nbsp;The notion of standing one's ground as a tenet or maxim of the law is not particularly new. &nbsp;What's relatively new and particularly Texan is just how much ground one can stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Borrowed from English common law, American common law permitted one to stand one's ground in the face of attack but incorporated a duty to retreat if it could be done safely.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a retreat could not be accomplished safely, then the person under attack could use deadly force to protect him or herself against death or serious bodily injury. &nbsp;Traditionally, there was one exception: there was no duty to retreat in one's own home. &nbsp;One's home was one's castle. &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>Texas common law and then Texas criminal statutes pared back this duty to retreat. &nbsp;Section 9.31(a) of the Penal Code reads thus: <BR>&quot;(a) Except as provided in Subsection (b), a person is justified in using force against another when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to protect the actor against the other's use or attempted use of unlawful force. The actor's belief that the force was immediately necessary as described by this subsection is presumed to be reasonable if the actor:&nbsp;(1) knew or had reason to believe that the person against whom the force was used:&nbsp;(A) unlawfully and with force entered, or was attempting to enter unlawfully and with force, the actor's occupied habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment;&nbsp;(B) unlawfully and with force removed, or was attempting to remove unlawfully and with force, the actor from the actor's habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment; or&nbsp;(C) was committing or attempting to commit aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery;&nbsp;(2) did not provoke the person against whom the force was used; and&nbsp;(3) was not otherwise engaged in criminal activity, other than a Class C misdemeanor that is a violation of a law or ordinance regulating traffic at the time the force was used.&quot;Section 9.31(e) explicitly eliminates the requirement to retreat, and Section 9.31(f) states that under this section, neither judge nor jury may consider whether the person retreated, while determining criminal culpability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 9.31(d) then goes on to limit the use of deadly force to an ostensibly discrete set of circumstances also found in Subchapter C of the Penal Code. &nbsp;Those alleged limits, however, are simply the situations found in Section 9.31(a), but where the person reasonably believes that not just any force will do - deadly force must be employed (Section 9.32); instances of protecting a third person (Section 9.33); and preserving another's life in an emergency (Section 9.34). &nbsp;  <BR>The Texas law departs radically from the traditional notion of self defense. &nbsp;In the age-old tension between dignity of the person and dignity of life, it seems to err on the side of dignity of the person. &nbsp;Where the traditional notion of self-defense gave a person the right to use deadly force once he had retreated &quot;to the wall,&quot; and where the wall was often confined to one's home, Texas expands the scope of where a person may use deadly force: to the home, to the car, to the person's own business, and even to the person's place of employment, as well as to anywhere where they may be to prevent various violent crimes.  <BR>Notably, the law gives an enormous amount of discretion to the actor who seeks to use the force in any of these situations. &nbsp;The standard employed is reasonable belief. &nbsp;Therefore, if a person uses deadly force, and she is entirely mistaken about the actions or intentions of the person against whom she uses the force, but she was reasonable in her belief (and mistake), there is no culpability. &nbsp;Further, the statute and case law also permit a person to use deadly force and not just do so while retreating or merely standing his ground; he can actually pursue the person against whom he seeks to use the force if doing so is consistent with the rest of the law, or even depart from the retreat in order to retrieve a weapon to fight back. &nbsp;  <BR>The statute also presents other issues. &nbsp;If a person is engaging in criminal activity, he cannot avail himself of the protections of the statute. &nbsp;In a sense, this is like a trial before a trial. &nbsp;Before a person has been convicted of engaging in criminal activity - even in her own home - she must surrender any protections she may have had to defend herself under this law. &nbsp;Section 9.34 is perhaps the least intuitive and least interpreted section of the Texas law. &nbsp;For instance, a person may use deadly force to preserve the life of another in an emergency. &nbsp;  <BR>The protection of the law is not without limits, however. &nbsp;Generally, a person cannot claim to stand his or her ground and use lethal force merely to protect property. Lethal force can be used, however, if while protecting property, the person's life is in danger. &nbsp;Also, the person cannot create the situation. &nbsp;Last year, a Houston jury convicted a firefighter of murder after he attempted to invoke the stand-your-ground defense. &nbsp;The defendant in that case had gone to his neighbor's house to complain about noise, and a confrontation ensued in the street; the defendant recorded the event. &nbsp;The defendant then shot one of the men at the party; the man was unarmed. &nbsp;The defendant, apparently, had been armed with a recording device and a firearm.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An interesting coda to this story. &nbsp;Last year, it was reported that economists at Texas A&amp;M had found a correlation between rates of homicide and states that have stand your ground laws. &nbsp;That report may be viewed here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure mounted on the Justice Department Sunday to pursue federal criminal charges in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in the aftermath of the acquittal Saturday of his killer, George Zimmerman. <BR>NAACP President Ben Jealous called on the Justice Department to take up the killing of Mr. Martin, a 17-year-old who was unarmed and black.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jealous said Justice Department officials should bring charges under a 2009 hate crimes law, known in shorthand as the Shepard Act, that makes it a federal crime to willfully cause bodily injury, or attempting to do so with a firearm, when the act was committed because of race, religion or sexual orientation. &quot;There is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,&quot; he told CNN's State of the Union, referring to Mr. Zimmerman. <BR>An ongoing federal probe has been looking at whether Mr. Zimmerman could be prosecuted under the Shepard Act, which was passed in the wake of the brutal, high-profile killings of Matthew Shepard, who was a gay college student, and James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man. <BR>The FBI and Justice Department civil rights prosecutors last year opened an investigation into the shooting of Mr. Martin. That probe continues, and it will include a detailed review of all the evidence presented in the state case, according to officials. <BR>It may prove more difficult to charge Mr. Zimmerman federally than it was to try him in state court, as the legal threshold for bringing a federal charge is much higher. Under the U.S. hate crimes statute, prosecutors must show a specific discriminatory intent in his actions. Simply demonstrating negligence or recklessness would not be sufficient. <BR>Alan Vinegrad, a lawyer at Covington and Burling LLP, who as a Justice Department lawyer in the 1990's prosecuted high-profile civil rights cases in New York, said a federal prosecutor would have to meet several legal conditions in order to bring a case under civil rights laws that predate the Shepard Act. For instance, such a prosecution would have to show that Mr. Zimmerman targeted the teen because of his race and because he was using a public facility, in this case a public street. <BR>&quot;There are significant challenges that a federal prosecutor would have in bringing a civil rights case,&quot; said Mr. Vinegrad. <BR>Mr. Jealous, who said his group had spoken with senior Justice officials about the matter, cited comments from young black boys in Mr. Martin's neighborhood who said they had felt singled out by Mr. Zimmerman, a 29-year-old former neighborhood-watch volunteer who is Hispanic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels so often that our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys,&quot; he said.  <BR>Mr. Jealous was one of many civil rights and elected officials who spoke about the case Sunday on the morning talk shows. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D., Ariz.) said he supported a Justice Department investigation into the case. He stopped short of saying that Mr. Zimmerman should be charged at this point but said the investigation should &quot;to lead to a consequence of charges, if necessary.&quot;  <BR>Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican and possible presidential candidate for 2016, defended the judicial process and the jury's decision Sunday.  <BR>&quot;I think our justice system is color blind,&quot; he told CNN's &quot;State of the Union.&quot; &quot;That jury made the right decision from their standpoint.&quot;  <BR>Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also defended the verdict.  <BR>&quot;It seemed to me it was an accurate verdict,&quot; he told the ABC program &quot;This Week,&quot; adding that there were a lot of &quot;reasonable doubts&quot; about Mr. Zimmerman's guilt.  <BR>The case shouldn't have been prosecuted in the first place, said Rep. Steve King (R., Iowa). &quot;The evidence didn't support prosecution, and the Justice Department engaged in this. . . . I regret that this all happened. I'm sorry that it was turned into a race issue,&quot; he said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;  <BR>Mr. Martin's family is still &quot;in disbelief&quot; about the verdict but is going to look at the option of filing a civil suit, family lawyer Benjamin Crump told ABC. &quot;They deeply want a sense of justice,&quot; he said.  <BR>While the judge continually tried to bar race from the arguments and deliberations, Mr. Crump said the trial was infused with it. &quot;We would be intellectually dishonest,&quot; he said, &quot;if we don't acknowledge the racial undertones in this case.&quot;  <BR>Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, who resigned amid a prostitution scandal and is now running for New York City comptroller, appeared on ABC and called the verdict &quot;a failure of justice.&quot; Still, he said, the federal government would have a difficult time bringing another criminal case against Mr. Zimmerman because of prohibitions against trying a defendant twice on similar charges.  <BR>Some senior Democrats said the justice system worked as designed.  <BR>&quot;I don't always agree with what the jury does, but that's the system and I support the system,&quot; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; &nbsp;He said he would &quot;accept the verdict.'  <BR>Rep. Chaka Fattah, (D., Pa.) a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN's &quot;State of the Union&quot; that the verdict sends a signal that Mr. Zimmerman's could commit the same act again and be found not guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the acquittal of George Zimmerman began to sink in Sunday, the streets of South Florida stayed mostly quiet. But anger and disappointment filled pews in African-American churches where pastors tried to comfort their aggrieved flocks. <BR>The ministers themselves were struggling.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments after the not-guilty verdict in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black Miami Gardens teenager, was announced Saturday night, the Rev. Arthur Jackson III said his young nephew asked him: &quot;Why?&quot; <BR>&quot;I didn't know what to say,&quot; Jackson told his congregation at Antioch Missionary Baptist, the Miami Gardens church where Trayvon's mother has worshipped. <BR>Every pew and chair in the sanctuary was full hours after a jury of six women dismissed the second-degree murder charge against Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watchman who shot the unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon in the heart during a violent struggle on a residential street in Central Florida more than a year ago. Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, said he acted in self-defense. <BR>When Zimmerman wasn't immediately charged, the high-profile case galvanized civil-rights activists and prompted a national debate over racial profiling and Florida's contentious Stand Your Ground law. <BR>On Sunday, President Barack Obama urged Americans to think about how to increase compassion and understanding, stem gun violence and prevent future tragic deaths. <BR>&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; said Obama, who last year noted that if he had a son, he would have looked like Trayvon. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; <BR>Protestors angry with the jury's decision demonstrated Sunday across the country, including San Francisco; Newark, N.J.; New York; Atlanta and Madison, Wisc. They carried signs in Washington, D.C., and rallied in downtown Chicago, the Associated Press reported. More protests are planned for Monday. <BR>A late-night gathering in Oakland, Calif., Saturday ended with broken windows, burned U.S. flags and a vandalized police car, according to the AP. About 200 people marched after the verdict was delivered through downtown Tallahassee. <BR>A statewide &quot;Day of Action&quot; was scheduled for Tuesday outside the Florida Capitol by Dream Defenders, a group dedicated to social change through non-violent civil disobedience. <BR>In South Florida, the peaceful demonstrations were muted by rainstorms throughout the day. By Sunday afternoon, Miami-Dade police had reopened parks previously closed for planned gatherings, and a rumor control line was shut down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miami is a far more mature community than it was 25, 30 years ago when we had violent reactions to criminal court verdicts,&quot; said Ed Shohat, a member of Miami-Dade's Community Relations Board, which was monitoring reaction through churches, community organizations and on social media, and did not see any signs of unrest.  <BR>Police officers and pastors held meetings over the five-week trial encouraging potential demonstrators to remain peaceful.  <BR>&quot;The tragic loss of life of a young man - a product of our hometown - has been a very emotional issue for our community,&quot; Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said in a written statement urging residents &quot;to come together and pray for the families as we move forward in the healing process.&quot;  <BR>A vigil Sunday evening at the Torch of Friendship in downtown Miami near Bayfront Park drew more than 100 people. They marched to the steps of the Freedom Tower, some wearing hoodies like the one Trayvon wore the night he was killed.  <BR>Others held protest signs - &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; - lighters and candles, chanting even as rain began to fall.  <BR>Earlier in Miami Gardens, Jackson, the church pastor, was asked by reporters if he thought violence might erupt in response to the verdict.  <BR>&quot;They asked me, 'Will the people in the community arm themselves?' I said, 'Yes. We're armed with power of the Lord.'&quot;  <BR>&quot;We just keep our faith,&quot; said I'esha Felton, one of Trayvon's cousins. &quot;We don't want this to happen again.&quot;  <BR>At Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Liberty City, the Rev. Gaston Smith delivered a joyful sermon to his parishioners because, he said afterward, &quot;They came to church sad today.&quot;  <BR>He told the dozens of people assembled that judgment and vengeance belong to God.  <BR>&quot;Give us healing, not hatred,&quot; he said. &quot;Make us better, not bitter.&quot;  <BR>Smith said he stayed up all night praying and reading the Bible, &quot;trying to make sense&quot; of the verdict. &quot;There's a feeling in our community that a 17-year-old black kid has no value,&quot; he told the Miami Herald.  <BR>Sunday afternoon, a diverse group of about a dozen people organized by the interdenominational group Mission Miami gathered in front of North Miami City Hall to pray for peace, unity and the Martin and Zimmerman families. After holding hands and praying for 20 minutes, they departed with hugs and a song.  <BR>&quot;We are a wonderful people that work hard and love our families and want what everyone wants, the opportunity to live our lives free from molestation, persecution, and in the pursuit of our greatest happiness,&quot; Miami Gardens Mayor Oliver Gilbert III said in a written statement advising his constituents to defy expectations of violence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will mourn Trayvon and grieve with his family.&quot;  <BR>In the Central Florida town of Sanford, where the shooting took place, some residents sought solace in family, community and familiar places.  <BR>Richard Taylor, who lives in the city's historically black Goldsboro neighborhood, walked with his 5-year-old daughter, Ty Juaiun Burke, to a landscaped stone-and-wood memorial for Trayvon and 10 others who may have been unjustly killed near Sanford.  <BR>&quot;How am I supposed to explain to my kids that a kid like them was walking home when someone else jumped out and shot him - and that person isn't in jail, where bad people are supposed to go,&quot; he said.  <BR>Ty Juaiun pulled at her dad's T-shirt and asked about the memorial: &quot;are those people in there?&quot;  <BR>&quot;No, baby,&quot; he said. &quot;They're in heaven.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trials, Andrew Cohen writes, &quot;can never act as moral surrogates to resolve the national debates they trigger.&quot; <BR>On Saturday night, George Zimmerman was found &quot;not guilty&quot; in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The verdict has spawned a fair amount of outrage. &nbsp;But it's not an outrageous verdict. The outrageous parts came long before the verdict, and could never have been fixed by a trial. <BR>&quot;I think the jury basically got it right,&quot; wrote Ta-Nehisi Coates. They were charged only with interpreting Florida law and the facts at hand. And &quot;by Florida law, in any violent confrontation ending in a disputed act of lethal self-defense, without eye-witnesses, the advantage goes to the living.&quot; <BR>Zimmerman's trial bore a weight it could never carry. It was supposed to bring clarity and course to the events of that night, 18 months ago, when Zimmerman and Martin met in the dark and then things happened and then Zimmerman shot Martin and Martin died. But we'll never have real clarity on what happened that night. And there'll never be real closure, either. The legal system promises justice but demands evidence &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; When the truth of events can never be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the legal system can't deliver on its promise of justice. <BR>Trials, Cohen writes, &quot;are tiny slivers of the truth of the matter, the perspective as narrow as if you were staring at the horizon with blinders on, capable only of seeing what was not intentionally blocked from view.&quot; <BR>But blinders can bring focus, too. Some of the issues driving the trial can be seen more clearly in its aftermath. <BR>Florida's gun laws, for instance, makes cases like this one likely and even inevitable. Would Zimmerman have left his car and followed Martin without the comfort of the cold steel strapped to his body? It's unlikely. But Florida's laws are such that the kind of people who want to get out of their car and tail teenagers who scare them can carry guns when they do it, and Florida's laws are such that if there's then a confrontation and the gun goes off the person holding the gun is very likely to walk free. <BR>And then there's the racial reality of the case. &quot;The most damning element here is not that George Zimmerman was found not guilty,&quot; writes Jelani Cobb. &quot;It's the bitter knowledge that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was found guilty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can understand the verdict to mean validation for the idea that the actions Zimmerman took that night were those of a reasonable man, that the conclusions he drew were sound, and that a black teenager can be considered armed any time he is walking down a paved street,&quot; Cobb continues. <BR>That might go a bit far. We can also understand the verdict as saying Zimmerman's guilt wasn't proven rather than that his actions were reasonable. But to understand the verdict as simply that is to ignore - or will away - everything around it, and everything before it, and everything that African-American men see in it, and what it says about how they have to act going forward. <BR>When Gawker's Cord Jefferson was in college in Virginia, he and his girlfriend were parked in a hotel lot eating sandwiches. The security guard drove up and asked Jefferson's partner to step out of the vehicle. But she wasn't in trouble. She was just being checked up on. &quot;Are you safe right now?&quot; The guard asked. <BR>It almost goes without saying that Jefferson is black and his girlfriend was white. <BR>&quot;It is a complicated thing to be young, black, and male in America,&quot; writes Jefferson. &quot;Not only are you well aware that many people are afraid of you-you can see them clutching their purses or stiffening in their subway seats when you sit across from them-you must also remain conscious of the fact that people expect you to be apologetic for their fear.&quot; <BR>During the trial, Martin's mother was asked by the defense whether she was avoiding the fact that Martin's actions could've contributed to his death. Perhaps if Martin had acted differently - if he hadn't been scared or been angry, or if he'd turned around and smiled and spoken to Zimmerman in a voice that reminded Zimmerman of kids he knew and liked rather than kids he feared - perhaps then, Martin would be alive today. Perhaps if he'd been quick enough and clearheaded enough to apologize for Zimmerman's fear the night would have all turned out fine. We can see that now, too, and it's an ugly thing to see.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One trial for George Zimmerman is over, but another one begins. Found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Zimmerman is a free man today. But it's unlikely he will be able to resume a normal life anytime soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions will dog Zimmerman for the rest of his days, including why he saw fit to tail a black teenager wearing a hoodie on a February 2012 night in Sanford, Fla. A licensed, gun-carrying member of a neighborhood-watch group, Zimmerman had called in a suspicious person's notice to a police dispatcher. Zimmerman was told to back off and wait for officers to arrive. He didn't take the advice and, eventually, there was a fatal confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday night, a jury of six women acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree-murder charges in Martin's death. So far, the verdict in this emotionally charged case has produced little violence -- a tribute to all parties, including Martin's family, for asking the public to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But tensions remain high. No matter the verdict, it's still a tragedy. Nothing will bring back Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old black kid who was walking to his father's house when he encountered Zimmerman, 29, who is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Off the hook in his criminal trial, Zimmerman may now wind up in a federal court. NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous has launched a petition calling for the U.S. Justice Department to open a civil-rights case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this what the country needs -- more divisiveness concerning racial attitudes? Maybe it does, just to find the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are not blaming the Florida jury for this verdict. Based on the insufficient prosecutorial evidence presented in court, the jury was compelled to decide that Zimmerman was acting in self-defense under the state's Stand Your Ground Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, justice leaves a bitter taste. After a two-week trial, we still don't know who was the aggressor leading up to the fatal moment in the confrontation. And while Martin, who was unarmed, had gained the upper hand in the fight, according to a witness, it remains questionable as to whether Zimmerman's life was in extreme danger when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman doesn't have any regrets about that February night, shame on him. He should. He acted irresponsibly. Even police encountering a threatening situation are urged to call for backup; Zimmerman was told to stand down, and he didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What fears preyed on Zimmerman to do what he did? Was he purely thinking about public safety, or was there something more ominous in his pursuit of Martin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy doesn't end with the Florida verdict. Zimmerman is a free man, but he will never be free from his conscience and the circumstances surrounding Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTERS reacted with fury after a neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager was cleared over the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for George Zimmerman, 29, argued he acted in selfdefence and with justifiable use of deadly force in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was cleared by a jury of second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case sparked a fierce debate about racial profiling in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama had said if he had a son 'he'd look like Trayvon'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict police and community leaders appealed for calm in Sanford, the town where the shooting took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protest marches were staged in several cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia and Washington, and there were reports of buildings being attacked in Oakland, California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman showed little reaction as the verdict was read out. His lawyer Mark O'Mara said after the case: &quot;Hopefully everyone will respect the jury's verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the Martin family lawyer, said: &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin will forever remain in the annals of history... as a symbol for the fight for equal justice for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin's family maintained throughout the trial that the teenager wasn't the aggressor, and prosecutors suggested Mr Martin was scared because he was being followed by a stranger. But defence attorneys claimed Mr Martin knocked Mr Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the concrete sidewalk when Mr Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Mr Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him as a 'wannabe cop' vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighbourhood committed primarily by young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claimed Mr Zimmerman assumed Mr Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racially-charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one of the few times it was one of the few times it was came from witness Rachel Jeantel, the Miami teenager who was talking to Martin by phone 'moments before he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she overheard Mr She said she overheard Mr Martin demand: 'What are you following me for?' and then yell, 'Get off! Get off!' before his mobile phone went dead.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON _ President Barack Obama's administration pledged Monday to continue a yearlong investigation into Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death and determine whether to file federal charges following a state jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Obama took the unusual step of speaking publicly about a case in a state court, he stopped short of criticizing the jury that handed down its verdict late Saturday after a trial broadcast on national television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he used the case to push for a series of gun control measures that were defeated earlier this year after an elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president wanted to convey that he felt that the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy for his family, for a community, but also for the country,&quot; White House spokesman Jay Carney said of the shooting death last year of the black teenager. &quot;And he wanted to express his view ... that we should ask ourselves if we are doing all that we can to foster compassion and understanding in our communities and to stem the tide of gun violence, as well as how we can prevent future tragedies like this from happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, who has a white father and a Latina mother, argued that he was defending himself when he shot Martin, 17, as the teen was walking home through a Sanford, Fla., gated community in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that he is mindful of the &quot;pain felt by our nation surrounding the tragic, unnecessary shooting death&quot; of Martin and that the case provides an opportunity for the nation to speak honestly about &quot;complicated and emotionally charged issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are resolved ... to combat violence involving or directed at young people, to prevent future tragedies and to deal with the underlying attitudes, mistaken beliefs and stereotypes that serve as the basis for these too common incidents,&quot; Holder said at the anniversary celebration of the predominantly African-American sorority Delta Sigma Theta. &quot;And we will never stop working to ensure that _ in every case, in every circumstance, and in every community _ justice must be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder and two other Cabinet members _ Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan _ will speak Tuesday at the NAACP conference in Orlando, Fla., not far from Sanford. They are expected to speak about gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal has led to scattered demonstrations across the nation and questions from civil rights organizations. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed an NAACP petition calling on the Justice Department to launch a civil rights investigation, while thousands have signed a White House petition asking Holder to file charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Capitol Hill, few lawmakers weighed in on the case beyond the head of the Congressional Black Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, told MSNBC that she was &quot;disheartened and troubled&quot; by the verdict. &quot;They put a young black boy on trial for being in his own neighborhood, walking home from the store,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four leaders _ House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.; and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. _ have been uncharacteristically quiet. In answer to a question Sunday on NBC, Reid said he accepted the verdict but planned to take a closer look at Florida's gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland mentioned the case briefly when delivering opening remarks at the NAACP conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must come together as a nation to learn from the tragedy of his death and take steps to ensure that every single life is equally cherished and protected under our laws,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Washington, Holder said his department will &quot;continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carney said Obama would not get involved in the Justice Department investigation and declined to say whether Obama is feeling pressure to weigh in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a decision made by the Justice Department, by career prosecutors, and all questions about how that process is undertaken should be directed there,&quot; he said. &quot;And that is not something the president involves himself in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, after Martin's death but before Zimmerman was charged, Obama weighed in on the case with the most personal of statements. &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; he said when asked about the case in the Rose Garden in March 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama issued another statement this weekend, calling on every American to undergo a period of &quot;calm reflection&quot; after the verdict was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carney declined to say whether Obama had spoken to Martin's family this weekend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON _ The &quot;true genius of America,&quot; Barack Obama said the night America elected its first black president in 2008, is &quot;that American can change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uproar over the George Zimmerman verdict is a vivid, somber reminder of how that change comes slowly, even haltingly at times, and how much race still courses through American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the days of legal segregation and institutional discrimination are now a generations-old memory, major policy disputes roiling Washington continue to have racial subtexts. The immigration fight is in one sense a fight for the loyalty of the growing, influential Latino voting bloc. The battle over how or whether to strengthen the recently diluted Voting Rights Act stirs fears that blacks in the South will lose long-cherished rights. Other clashes over the size, scope and cost of government continue to have racial undercurrents as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Different groups have different views of what government policy should be, and that doesn't seem to be going away at all,&quot; said Merle Black, a Southern politics expert at Emory University in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman verdict has the potential to harden racial attitudes that have been developing for generations. The Sanford, Fla., neighborhood watch volunteer was found not guilty Saturday in connection with the death of black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History shows that once certain groups of voters learn to trust a political party, they don't switch allegiances. They remember perceptions of who worked against their interest, perhaps in opposing civil rights laws or denying funding to programs for lower-income people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black voters were intensely loyal to the Republican Party for roughly 70 years, remembering Abraham Lincoln's abolishing slavery and the party stalwarts who continued that legacy. Democrats were the party of the segregated South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The perception began to change during Franklin Roosevelt's presidency, as his New Deal helped ease the Depression's pain and first lady Eleanor Roosevelt became a champion of civil rights. When her husband ran for re-election in 1936, he got an estimated 71 percent of the black vote. Obama, the nation's first black president, got 93 percent of the black vote in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Latino community is still emerging as a political force. Though it has been trending more Democratic in recent years, Republicans still see opportunities. Polls suggest Latino voters will back Republicans who demonstrate sensitivity to immigration issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been a leader in the bipartisan effort to create a path to citizenship for the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants. He has endured withering conservative criticism for his stance and yet remains a prominent voice in his party and a potentially formidable 2016 presidential contender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly there's a subtext to this whole fight over immigration. Both parties have blatant political motives on this issue,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll and author of &quot;Minority Party,&quot; a book about race in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Latino community is watching closely. An America's Voice/Latino Decisions poll of Hispanic voters last month found 53 percent named immigration as the nation's most important issue. Nearly two-thirds said they knew an undocumented immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also showed a willingness to vote for either party, as 48 percent said they had voted for a Republican in the past. As the undocumented immigrants become legal voters, most could very well side with either party, argued Adrian Pantoja, senior analyst at Latino Decisions, which studies Hispanic voting trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Undocumented immigrants are still learning the positions and orientations of the political parties,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the more the Democratic Party promotes itself as the party of racial sensitivity, the more it hamstrings Republicans' efforts to diversify. Obama on Sunday issued a somber statement asking &quot;every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; Sixteen months ago, Obama was more blunt. &quot;When I think about this boy I think about my own kids,&quot; he lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans this week have said little. Neither House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, nor Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has spoken publicly about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican Party officials routinely deny any racial undercurrent to their thinking on immigration, voting rights or for that matter any other issue. The party earlier this year launched an aggressive effort to woo minority voters through grassroots organizing and other strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But long-held images persist, and there has been little Republican enthusiasm for revisiting last month's Supreme Court ruling on the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The court struck down a key provision requiring areas with histories of racial bias to get federal approval for changes in voting laws. The act is a touchstone for many blacks, who recall its pivotal role in securing the right to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans urge looking at a broader picture. Wooing minorities will not happen all at once, and a key way to engage them, said former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, is to stress the party's economic views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As increasing numbers of people grow tired of politics that divide people,&quot; he said, &quot;you try breaking down the barriers with a growing economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His party has had only limited success with that mantra. President George W. Bush got 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. The former Texas governor's record as sensitive to Latino concerns such as education and immigration helped, but so did the booming economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, though, minority voters still zero in on certain issues more than whites. A 2009 Pew study of black voter attitudes found 53 percent of blacks thought major conflict existed between blacks and whites, while only one-third of whites felt that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now comes the Zimmerman case, sparking a new dialogue about race in American life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's likely to continue for some time, said Black of Emory University, because &quot;in different ways, race and ethnicity still structures a lot of American politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROTESTS erupted across the US yesterday after a neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager was cleared of murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the 17-year-old victim Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family yelled 'No! No!' outside a Florida court when the verdict was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flags were burnt and cars and windows smashed as marches were held in seven cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Oakland, California, said they were dealing with 'acts of vandalism' following protests by about 100 people. There were reports of marchers damaging a police squad car and officers forming a line to block the protesters' path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called for calm last night, saying the death was a tragedy and America should seek ways to stem gun violence. 'We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,' he said. 'I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was freed after he was found not guilty of all charges over the shooting of Trayvon in February last year. He said he acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury considered nearly three weeks of conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor. The killing unleashed furious debate across the US over racial profiling and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called the 29-year-old defendant a liar and 'wannabe cop' vigilante but defence lawyers said after his acquittal: 'George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defence.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: Yeah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: OK, we don't need you to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first tragedy of the Trayvon Martin case is that it didn't have to happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman didn't have to trail the teenager through the darkened streets of the gated Florida community, didn't have to get out of his truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was told not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the struggle that followed, the unarmed boy was shot and killed   an unarmed African-American teen, shot and killed by a Neighborhood Watch volunteer who found his presence &quot;suspicious.&quot; It's those details that caused a public outcry when police and prosecutors initially declined to charge Zimmerman with a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those same details hang over Saturday's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation should respect the jury that found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. Defense attorneys argued that he fired in self-defense, and prosecutors couldn't prove otherwise. Without enough evidence to challenge Zimmerman's version of events, jurors had no choice but to acquit. We saw a criminal justice system that is designed to protect the rights of the accused, that rightly sets a high bar for a criminal conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors reached a unanimous verdict. The jurors did their job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same can't be said of police and prosecutors in the aftermath of the shooting. It is their cavalier response   not the verdict   that compounds this tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford, Fla., police quickly accepted Zimmerman's explanation that he pulled his gun because he felt his life was in danger. They weren't duly troubled by his remarks that Martin was a &quot;punk&quot; who &quot;looks like he's up to no good.&quot; They didn't sufficiently question his account or his motives. They shrugged it off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An angry public demanded to know whether police and prosecutors would have scrutinized the evidence more closely if Martin were white. It was, and is, a fair question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million people signed an online petition demanding Zimmerman's arrest. The U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into Martin's death. The Sanford police chief stepped down, and a special prosecutor was named to handle the case. Six weeks after the shooting, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the Zimmerman was eventually acquitted of the charge   and the lesser charge of manslaughter, which the jury also rejected   doesn't validate the cursory dismissal by law enforcement back in February 2012. This case deserved to be examined thoroughly and adjudicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the case moved to trial, many of those who led the campaign stressed that what they demanded was not an outcome, but a trial. But many now are bitterly disappointed at the result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was fair. The evidence came up short. The outrage was that there almost wasn't a trial at all.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New laws needed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As our president has requested, I am willing to accept the verdict of the jury in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently no laws were violated. Our legislators need to get busy and write new laws that will define leaving one's home with a loaded weapon and looking for trouble as vigilantism. The phrase &quot;stand your ground&quot; means you are minding your own business and someone else initiates a threat against you. That is not what happened in this instance. The exact sequence of events, who first hit whom, who was screaming on the tape, do not matter. The bottom line is that if George Zimmerman had stayed home that night, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would be alive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patricia Merrifield<BR>Carmel Valley </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shame for Zimmerman, jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what we know about the George Zimmerman trial: Zimmerman assumed that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was up to no good or planning to commit a crime based on the way he looked or the way he was walking. That's clear from the 911 recordings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know that Zimmerman followed Martin and that Martin reacted to the actions that Zimmerman initiated. We don't know what was said or who threw the first punch but we know a fight broke out, which never would have happened if Zimmerman had stayed in his truck or hadn't made such erroneous assumptions about Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight seemed to be pretty evenly matched until Zimmerman pulled the gun. Then the fight was over and so was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life. Martin may have been getting the better of Zimmerman but there's no evidence that Zimmerman's life was ever in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman expressed anger and perhaps hate when the whole episode started and I'm sure those emotions escalated when he found himself in a fight. He should be ashamed of himself for ending a non-life-threatening fight this way and so should the jury for acquitting him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel DeCamp<BR>Seaside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shame on Ben Jealous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recall thinking it was pretty cool when Ben Jealous was elected to head of the national NAACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born and raised in sleepy Pacific Grove, his white father the creator of &quot;Breakthrough for Men,&quot; his black mother the creator of &quot;Break Free for Women,&quot; his is a dynamic, socially proactive family. I thought he would bring balanced and rational thinking to the organization known to take over-the-top reactionary positions on issues that often do people of color more harm than good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well my expectation of the young man has been dashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shame on Ben Jealous to have the anti-Constitutional gall to demand that Barack Obama and the Department of Justice ignore the verdict in the Zimmerman trial. Certainly Zimmerman, who is half-Jewish and half-Hispanic, therefore more ethnic that Ben Jealous, is a low life but there's isn't a shred of evidence to prove he acted out of racist hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How come the Hispanic and Jewish communities aren't taking to the streets to confront the loonies led by Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Ben Jealous?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confront them and tell them to grow up and shut up and go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Greenleaf<BR>Big Sur</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Play by the rules</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did so much work on the obviously commercial Carmel Canine Sports Center get done on agricultural land without permits?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county informed the developers that &quot;any activity not related to agricultural production&quot; was prohibited. Under the pretext of preparing for &quot;agricultural production,&quot; the developers have stripped the 45-acre site of all vestiges of agricultural use and begun constructing parking lots and other facilities. They have done this while posting signs and submitting plans to the county announcing the development of a large for-profit operation. In response, the county has acquiesced in this commercial development with full knowledge that it is &quot;not related to agricultural production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the developers is a member of the county Planning Commission, which plays a central role in determining how this project proceeds. Under these circumstances, the county is obliged to comply with the law and its own rules and to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Apparently the county has chosen not to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not you are in favor or are directly impacted, you have an interest in seeing that the county plays by the rules.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A way to ease tight parking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding theJuly 11 article by Phillip Molnar on packed parking in Monterey , I wanted to share an observation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I often am the first customer on weekdays at Peet's Coffee when it opens at 5 a.m., sometimes arriving at 4:45. I have watched five or more cars park in the lot and the drivers walk into Trader Joe's in their work uniforms to presumably go to work. It is possible that later these same drivers move their cars elsewhere during shift breaks. However, it appears to me that they still contribute to the lack of parking spaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would think that if there were incentives (e.g. parking vouchers at garages) provided by all the shopping center employers, these same employees might park elsewhere and walk the extra five to 10 minutes. Of course, there will always be the occasional employee who is late and has to park in front to get a timecard punched on time, but all in all this solution might be advantageous to storekeepers, employees and customers alike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing something about water problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I keep seeing articles and op-eds in the paper on how frustrated everyone is with how the water situation on our Peninsula is being handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well I would like to say hats off to the folks who have stepped up to take a leadership role and get something done on this issue. It can't be easy to stand up and try to help, and then be barraged with criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to say thank you to everyone who is trying to find a solution to this very complex problem.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">621 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's trial raised as many questions as it answered, but one thing was proved convincingly: television in courtrooms can have damaging effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury had barely been seated when observers wondered why defense attorney Don West opened with a tasteless knock-knock joke. Would he have tried if he wasn't playing to a national audience?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida was among the first states to permit televised trials, beginning in 1979. Notably, there had been a four-year delay because it proved impossible to get participants to grant permission. Telecasts finally began only after the state's Supreme Court removed the need for waivers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's high court declared, &quot;We are persuaded that on balance there is more to be gained than lost.&quot; The justices said they were primariy motivated by a &quot;commitment to open government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, that finding could also be used to argue against cameras in court. Is it acceptable for anything whatsoever to be &quot;lost&quot; in providing a fair trial? Should &quot;open government,&quot; while undeniably important, really be the &quot;prime&quot; factor in the criminal justice process?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having spent much of my career involved with Candid Camera, I am convinced that the presence of cameras is inhibiting. It can also encourage grandstanding, as Johnnie Cochran &amp; Co. demonstrated in O.J. Simpson's 1995 courtroom debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Zimmerman trial, televised testimony by prosecution witness Rachel Jeantel led to a raft of harsh comments about her in social media. Jeantel, who was only 17 at the time of Trayvon Martin's death, had been reluctant to testify. Her media experience is unlikely to inspire witnesses to come forward in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman never testified, and as it turned out he didn't need to. But Robert Shapiro, another cast member from the O.J. trial, told CNN he would have advised Zimmerman not to take the stand because TV might make him nervous. Imagine that: a man faces decades in prison, and a notable attorney believes his big worry could be television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, federal courts, up to and including the U.S. Supreme Court, have resisted TV coverage, despite the fact citizens would probably benefit by watching the proceedings. Trials like Zimmerman's, on the other hand, are of dubious educational value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Zimmerman's attorneys wrapped up their case, the nation got a glimpse of the next unwelcome chapter in video justice. The defense played a computer animation in its closing argument, employing Hollywood technology like that in the film &quot;Iron Man.&quot; In the video, Martin punches Zimmerman in the face at the start of their confrontation, even though no witness actually saw such a scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman's lawyers argued that digital images are simply modern extensions of in-court diagrams, it's hard to imagine that jurors didn't begin to feel they had actually witnessed something based on real life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television's poor performance turned laughable at one point when a prosecution witness, professor Scott Pleasants, testified via webcam. In a moment certain to live on YouTube for eternity, television viewers flooded Pleasants' computer with random messages, causing such a disruption that Judge Debra Nelson had to cut the feed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As technology improves and distribution via the Internet and cable-TV expands, there is an assumption that the negative impact of media gradually fades, while its utility expands. In fact, just the opposite seems true. Modern trials now involve the pressure of live TV and Hollywood style recreations, as well as instant second-guessing on social media. Tabloid interests are being served, but not necessarily justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York, Boston, San Francisco and other cities saw loud rallies and marches demanding &quot;Justice for Trayvon.&quot; Thousands demonstrated in New York's Union Square on Sunday evening. About 2,000 of the demonstrators then marched on Times Square, stopping traffic as they zigzagged through the streets to avoid police lines.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police tried and failed to funnel the crowd into controlled lanes. They managed to halt the march near the square but demonstrators forced their way around, with about 1,000 staging a sit-in at Times Square. In San Francisco and Los Angeles - where police had broken up an earlier protest with beanbag rounds - officers closed streets as protesters marched to condemn Mr Zimmerman's acquittal. Hours after the verdict, demonstrators gathered in Washington chanting: &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; and carrying signs that read: &quot;Stop criminalising black men.&quot; The Los Angeles protest stopped traffic for about 25 minutes, prompting police to issue a citywide tactical alert. In Boston about 500 racially mixed protesters left their demonstration site in the Roxbury neighbourhood and started marching in the streets alongside police escorts on motorcycles and on foot. Demonstrators raised signs saying: &quot;We Demand Justice,&quot; &quot;Stop Racial Profiling&quot; and &quot;Never Forget. Never Again. Justice for Trayvon.&quot; Over 500 people rallied on the streets of San Francisco, some carrying yellow signs with Mr Martin's photo. About a dozen police motorcycles and vans trailed the group of marchers, who banged on drums as they walked and continuously chanted: &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; Justice Department officials said it was considering whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Mr Zimmerman had been acquitted. President Barack Obama called the death of 17-year-old Mr Martin a tragedy for the country and urged calm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing unleashed furious debate across the US over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, blinked and barely smiled when the verdict was announced on Saturday night. He could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter. But the jury of six women, all but one of them white, reached a verdict of not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother and father were not in the courtroom when the verdict was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled &quot;No! No!&quot; upon learning of the not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teen's father, Tracy, reacted on Twitter: &quot;Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said simply: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; a reference to the Latin phrase &quot;Et tu, Brutus?&quot; known as an expression of betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Zimmerman lived. None of the witnesses who were called had a clear view of their encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers said the case was classic self-defence, claiming Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're ecstatic with the results,&quot; defence attorney Mark O'Mara after the verdict. &quot;George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of his defence team, Don West, said he was &quot;thrilled this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighbourhood committed primarily by young black men. Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Zimmerman's mindset &quot;fit the bill of second-degree murder&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We charged what we believed we could prove,&quot; Corey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors' names have not been made public, and they declined to speak to the news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the verdict drew near, police and city leaders in Sanford and other parts of Florida said they were taking precautions against the possibility of mass protests in the event of an acquittal. Martin family lawyer Benjamin Crump acknowledged the disappointment of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's supporters, ranking the teen alongside civil rights heroes Medgar Evers and Emmett Till in the history of the fight for equal justice. But he urged them not to resort to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara, Zimmerman's lawyer, said his client is aware he has to be cautious and protective of his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;They won't listen to a verdict of not guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict came a year and a half after civil rights protesters angrily demanded Zimmerman be prosecuted. That anger appeared to return onSaturday night outside the courthouse, at least for some who had been following the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosie Barron, 50, and Andrew Perkins, 55, both black residents of Sanford, stood in the parking lot of the courthouse and wept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I at least thought he was going to get something, something,&quot; Barron said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added her brother: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perkins was so upset he was shaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder,&quot; Perkins shouted, looking in the direction of the courthouse. &quot;He ain't getting no probation or nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Zimmerman supporters also were outside the courthouse, including a brother and sister quietly rejoicing that Zimmerman was acquitted. Both thought the jury made the right decision in finding Zimmerman not guilty &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; they felt that Zimmerman killed Martin in self-defence. Cindy Lenzen, 50, of Casslebury, and her brother, 52-year-old Chris Bay, stood watching the protesters chant slogans such as, &quot;the whole system's guilty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lenzen and Bay &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; who are white &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; called the entire case &quot;a tragedy&quot;, especially for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be possible to consider the case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted Saturday of all charges in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, as anything but a sad commentary on the state of race relations and the battle over gun rights in America today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly it is about race -- ask any black man, up to and including President Obama, and he will tell you at least a few stories that sound eerily like what happened that rainy winter night in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Zimmerman's conviction might have provided an emotional catharsis, we would still be a country plagued by racism, which persists in ever more insidious forms despite the Supreme Court's sanguine assessment that ''things have changed dramatically,'' as it said in last month's ruling striking down the heart of the Voting Rights Act. (The Justice Department is right to continue its investigation into whether Mr. Zimmerman may still be prosecuted under federal civil rights laws.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury reached its verdict after having been asked to consider Mr. Zimmerman's actions in light of Florida's now-notorious Stand Your Ground statute. Under that law, versions of which are on the books in two dozen states, a person may use deadly force if he or she ''reasonably believes'' it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm -- a low bar that the prosecutors in this case fought in vain to overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These laws sound intuitive: who would argue that you may not protect yourself against great harm? But of course, the concept of ''reasonable belief'' is transformed into something deadly dangerous when firearms are involved. And when the Stand Your Ground laws intersect with lax concealed-carry laws, it works essentially to self-deputize anyone with a Kel-Tec 9 millimeter and a grudge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a bad year so far for gun control. But if anything, cases like this should be as troubling as the mass killings that always prompt a national outcry and promises of legislative remedy. We were heartened that President Obama, in his statement after the verdict was issued, took the opportunity to denounce once again ''the tide of gun violence'' sweeping the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, what is most frightening is that there are so many people with guns who are like George Zimmerman. Fear and racism may never be fully eliminated by legislative or judicial order, but neither should our laws allow and even facilitate their most deadly expression. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was an unarmed boy walking home from the convenience store. If only Florida could give him back his life as easily as it is giving back George Zimmerman's gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin reverberated from church pulpits to street protests across the country on Sunday in a renewed debate about race, crime and how the American justice system handled a racially polarizing killing of a young black man walking in a quiet neighborhood in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers, members of the clergy and demonstrators who assembled in parks and squares on a hot July day described the verdict by the six-person jury as evidence of a persistent racism that afflicts the nation five years after it elected its first African-American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trayvon Benjamin Martin is dead because he and other black boys and men like him are seen not as a person but a problem,'' the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, told a congregation once led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Warnock noted that the verdict came less than a month after the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to void a provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. ''The last few weeks have been pivotal to the consciousness of black America,'' he said in an interview after services. ''Black men have been stigmatized.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer, had faced charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter -- and the prospect of decades in jail, if convicted -- stemming from his fatal shooting of Mr. Martin, 17, on the night of Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, a modest Central Florida city. Late Saturday, he was acquitted of all charges by the jurors, all of them women and none black, who had deliberated more than 16 hours over two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, calling Mr. Martin's death a tragedy, urged Americans on Sunday to respect the rule of law, and the Justice Department said it would review the case to determine if it should consider a federal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As dusk fell in New York, a modest rally that had begun hours earlier in Union Square grew to a crowd of thousands that snaked through Midtown Manhattan toward Times Square in an unplanned parade. Onlookers used cellphones to snap pictures of the chanting protesters and their escort by dozens of police cars and scores of officers on foot. Hundreds of bystanders left the sidewalks to join the peaceful demonstration, which brought traffic to a standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, the Rev. Valarie J. Houston drew shouts of support and outrage at Allen Chapel A.M.E. as she denounced ''the racism and the injustice that pollute the air in America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Lord, I thank you for sending Trayvon to reveal the injustices, God, that live in Sanford,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman and his supporters dismissed race as a factor in the death of Mr. Martin. The defense team argued that Mr. Zimmerman had acted in self-defense as the 17-year-old slammed Mr. Zimmerman's head on a sidewalk. Florida law explicitly gives civilians the power to take extraordinary steps to defend themselves when they feel that their lives are in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, told National Public Radio that race was not a factor in the case, adding: ''I never have a moment where I think that my brother may have been wrong to shoot. He used the sidewalk against my brother's head.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who had said shortly after Mr. Martin was killed that if he had a son, ''he'd look like Trayvon,'' urged the nation to accept the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement. ''Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, one of the country's leading advocates of gun control, said the death of Mr. Martin would continue to drive his efforts. ''Sadly, all the facts in this tragic case will probably never be known,'' he said. ''But one fact has long been crystal clear: 'Shoot first' laws like those in Florida can inspire dangerous vigilantism and protect those who act recklessly with guns.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reactions to the verdict suggested that racial relations remained polarized in many parts of this country, particularly regarding the American justice system and the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I pretty well knew that Mr. Zimmerman was going to be let free, because if justice was blind of colors, why wasn't there any minorities on the jury?'' said Willie Pettus, 57, of Richmond, Va.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maxine McCrey, attending services at Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York, said the verdict was a reminder of the failure of the justice system. ''There's no justice for black people,'' she said. ''Profiling and targeting our black men has not stopped.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. McCrey dabbed at her eyes as she recalled the moment she learned of the verdict. ''I cried,'' she said. ''And I am still crying.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many blacks, and some whites, questioned whether Mr. Zimmerman, who is part Hispanic, would have been acquitted if he were black and Mr. Martin were white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He would have been in jail already,'' Leona Ellzy, 18, said as she visited a monument to Mr. Martin in Sanford. ''The black man would have been in prison for killing a white child.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Fard, a community organizer in a black neighborhood in Denver, said Mr. Martin would be alive today if he were not black. ''If the roles were reversed, Trayvon would have been instantly arrested and, by now, convicted,'' he said. ''Those are realities that we have to accept.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even race's role in the case became a matter of a debate. One of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers, Mark O'Mara, said he also thought the outcome would have been different if his client were black -- but for reasons entirely different from those suggested by people like Mr. Fard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He never would have been charged with a crime,'' Mr. O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This became a focus for a civil rights event, which again is a wonderful event to have,'' he said. ''But they decided that George Zimmerman would be the person who they were to blame and sort of use as the creation of a civil rights violation, none of which was borne out by the facts. The facts that night were not borne out that he acted in a racial way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, Tommy Keith, 62, a white retired Cadillac salesman, rejected any contention that this was anything more than a failed murder case presented by the state. ''The state's got to prove their case, O.K.?'' he said. ''They didn't. Stand Your Ground law is acceptable with me, and these protests are more racial than anything else. In my opinion, it's not a racial thing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments of the announcement of the verdict Saturday night and continuing through Sunday, demonstrations, some planned and some impromptu, arose in neighborhoods in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, New York and Atlanta. There were no reports of serious violence or arrests as the day went on, a contrast with the riots that swept Los Angeles after the verdict in another race-tinged case, the 1992 acquittal of white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black construction worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In downtown Oakland, dozens of protesters filled the streets to denounce the verdict shortly after it was announced. Some of the protesters set fire to trash cans, broke the windows of businesses and damaged police patrol cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 40 people in Atlanta, carrying sodas and Skittles to underscore the errand to a store that Mr. Martin was completing when he was shot, marched to Woodruff Park on Saturday night. In Washington, about 250 marchers protested the verdict late Saturday and early Sunday as police cruisers trailed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hundred protesters gathered at a rally in downtown Chicago on Sunday, some wearing signs showing Mr. Martin wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'm heartbroken, but it didn't surprise me,'' said Velma Henderson, 65, a retired state employee who lives in a southern suburb of Chicago. ''The system is screwed. It's a racist system, and it's not designed for African-Americans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar sense of resignation flowed through St. Sabina, a Catholic church on the South Side of Chicago, where many parishioners are black. They gathered in the sanctuary holding signs that read, ''Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murdered again by INjustice system.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Like many of you, I'm angered, I'm disappointed, I'm disgusted,'' said the Rev. Michael Pfleger, who is white, told his congregation at St. Sabina. ''And yet like many of you, I'm not shocked. 'Cause unfortunately, this is the America that we know all too well. Yesterday, we watched the justice system fail miserably again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As blacks and whites struggled with the racial implications of the debate, many called for prayer and peace and urged that there be no escalation of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My heart is heavy,'' said Milton Felton, a cousin of Mr. Martin's, outside Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Miami Gardens, Fla., where members of the family had gathered. ''But that's our justice system. Let's be peaceful about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, parishioners seemed stricken by what many described as a reminder of how far the nation still needed to go to resolve its racial differences. ''I felt he was going to get off,'' said Helen Corley, attending services there. ''He knew he could do it and get away with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It crushed my spirit,'' she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- From the moment George Zimmerman held up his arms and told the police that he had shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, one fact was undisputed: an unarmed black teenager lay dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as one top Florida defense lawyer, Michael Band, said on Sunday, ''Trials, for better or worse, are not morality plays.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start, prosecutors faced a difficult case -- weak on evidence and long on outrage. Mr. Zimmerman had the power of self-defense laws on his side, and was helped by a spotty police investigation and prosecutorial missteps. The initial investigation foundered when the local prosecutor balked at bringing charges, convinced that overcoming the self-defense claims would prove impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But six weeks after the killing, his replacement, Angela B. Corey, from the Jacksonville area, charged Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder, a tall order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the trial, the fight between Mr. Martin and Mr. Zimmerman that preceded the shooting produced a muddle of testimony -- and grist for reasonable doubt. It remained unclear who had thrown the first punch and at what point Mr. Zimmerman drew his gun. There were no witnesses to the shooting and no definitive determination of which man could be heard yelling for help in the background of a 911 call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only version of events came from Mr. Zimmerman, who did not take the stand, denying prosecutors a chance to cross-examine him. His statements to the police spoke for him at the trial. Defense lawyers also had a powerful piece of evidence in photographs of Mr. Zimmerman's injuries: a bloody nose and cuts and lumps on the back of his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed that he shot Mr. Martin only after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him, straddled him and slammed his head into the concrete -- ''a weapon,'' as his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, called it. The murder charge required a showing that Mr. Zimmerman was full of ill will, hatred, spite or evil intent when he shot Mr. Martin. But prosecutors had little evidence to back up that claim, legal experts said. They could point only to Mr. Zimmerman's words during his call to the police dispatcher the night he spotted Mr. Martin walking in the rain with his sweatshirt's hood up and grew suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Punks,'' he said, adding a profanity. ''They always get away,'' he said, using another profanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Zimmerman appeared calm during the call and did not describe Mr. Martin's race until he was asked. And defense lawyers brought in witnesses to say that Mr. Zimmerman, on the whole, was a courteous, kind and caring neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That was a fatal flaw right from the start in the case,'' said Jeff Weiner, a well-known Miami criminal defense lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toward the end of the trial, prosecutors asked the judge to include the lesser charge of manslaughter, but the jury rejected that as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts pointed to what they said were errors by the prosecution. Several prosecution witnesses struggled on the stand and appeared not to have been prepared, including Rachel Jeantel, the young friend of Mr. Martin's who said he had told her on the phone that he was being followed and was scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors interviewed Ms. Jeantel for the first time in the house of Sybrina Fulton, Mr. Martin's mother, while Ms. Fulton sat next to her. Shaken up by Ms. Fulton's presence, Ms. Jeantel softened her account of the phone call to protect Ms. Fulton, she testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors also were hurt by the testimony of Officer Chris Serino of the Sanford Police Department, the chief investigator on the case. He told the jury he believed Mr. Zimmerman's account was truthful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet another trouble spot was the testimony of Dr. Shiping Bao, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Mr. Martin. On the stand, legal experts said, he came across as befuddled, shuffling through his notes because he could remember so little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was horrific,'' said Richard Sharpstein, a prominent Miami criminal defense lawyer. ''It was the deadly blow to this case because the case depended on forensic evidence to contradict or disprove George Zimmerman's story.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The performance was the opposite of that by Dr. Vincent Di Maio, a nationally recognized forensic pathologist, who took the stand for the defense. Polished and concise, Dr. Di Maio said the evidence and injuries to Mr. Zimmerman were consistent with the defense's account: that Mr. Martin was leaning over the defendant when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When Bao completely imploded, that was check,'' Mr. Sharpstein said. ''When Di Maio testified, it was checkmate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence of Mr. Zimmerman's injuries may have helped his case, but it was not legally necessary. He needed to show only that he feared great bodily harm or death when he pulled out his gun, which he was carrying legally, and shot Mr. Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Classic self-defense,'' Mr. O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after Mr. Zimmerman was arrested, there appeared to be a chance that the defense would invoke a provision of Florida self-defense law known as Stand Your Ground. Ultimately it was not part of Mr. O'Mara's courtroom strategy, though it did play a pivotal role immediately after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision, enacted by the Florida Legislature in 2005 and since adopted by more than 20 other states, allows people who fear great harm or death to stand their ground and not retreat, even if they can safely do so. The language is part of the state's overall self-defense law and thus was included in the judge's instructions to the jury. If an attacker is retreating, people are still permitted to use deadly force. But Mr. O'Mara said he did not rely on that provision in the courtroom because Mr. Zimmerman had no option to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Stand Your Ground provision also allows a defendant claiming self-defense to seek civil and criminal immunity from prosecution at a pretrial hearing based on a judge's determination. Mr. O'Mara did not seek such a hearing, fearing that if he had lost and was then forced to go to a jury trial, he would have already divulged his case to prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That was a brilliant strategic move,'' Mr. Sharpstein said. ''It precluded the state from previewing the defense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Stand Your Ground did play a role when the police were contemplating whether to charge Mr. Zimmerman, said Tamara Lave, an associate professor of law at the University of Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, if the police believe there is probable cause that someone acted in self-defense, as Mr. Zimmerman said he had, they are not allowed to make an arrest, she said. The self-defense claim also may have affected how thoroughly the police interviewed witnesses, preserved the crime scene and screened Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, the police arrested Mr. Zimmerman, but only after Gov. Rick Scott of Florida had appointed Ms. Corey as prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference after the verdict, Ms. Corey said prosecutors had been hindered by the fact they inherited the case well into the investigation. Still, she forged ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''What we promised to do was get this case in front of a jury,'' she said, ''and give Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman their day in court.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A news analysis on Monday about legal issues in the murder trial of George Zimmerman referred incompletely to the use of the Stand Your Ground provision of Florida's self-defense law. As the article correctly noted, Mr. Zimmerman's defense lawyers did not use the Stand Your Ground strategy in the self-defense case for their client. Some of the provision's language, however -- that Mr. Zimmerman ''had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force,'' including deadly force -- was contained in the judge's instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Regret is a very strong word . . . Regret implies that your actions - you have culpability in what you did for what happened. ' - Robert Zimmerman Jr. (left), on whether his acquitted brother, George (right), felt  any regret over the killing last year of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin (center) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George Zimmerman plans to start packing heat again - the same gun he used to kill Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - and he's going to need it, his lawyer said yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defense lawyer Mark O'Mara said Zimmerman's acquittal by a Florida jury means he's entitled to get back the Kel Tec-9 pistol he used to fatally shoot Martin last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked whether Zimmerman, 29, intends to carry the weapon, O'Mara replied &quot;yes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;[There's] even more reason now, isn't there?&quot; O'Mara told ABC News. &quot;There are a lot of people out there who actually hate him, though they shouldn't.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lawyer's comments came as Zimmerman's brother, Robert Jr., said George has no regrets over the deadly confrontation - and nothing to apologize for. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Regret is a very strong word,'' Robert Zimmerman told CNN.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Regret implies that your actions - you have culpability in what you did for what happened. And I think that's what you're asking is, 'Does he share or accept the blame?' I think that George, outside of the word 'blame,' feels and has felt - and I've expressed this before - very bad.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert - who has been acting as a spokesman for his embattled family - added that his brother should not apologize for anything. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I don't think that people who are forthcoming and forthright in what they do and believe they're doing the right thing should then go back,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Robert also said George &quot;does have emotion about the fact that he had to take a life in self-defense,&quot; before adding, &quot;But that is incompatible with finding culpability in what he did.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On NPR, Robert Zimmerman said he took &quot;exception&quot; to the notion that Martin was &quot;unarmed&quot; during his struggle with George on Feb. 26, 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He used the sidewalk against my brother's head,&quot; Robert said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Robert told CNN that his brother - who has gotten death threats - &quot;is going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman - who has been in hiding for months and wears a bulletproof vest and a disguise whenever he ventures out - remained in seclusion yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His not-guilty verdict spurred protests across the nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Civil-rights leaders urged the feds to bring charges against Zimmerman for shooting Martin, 17, while on a volunteer neighborhood-watch patrol of his gated community in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, President Obama called Martin's death a &quot;tragedy&quot; for the entire country that &quot;has elicited strong passions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; Obama said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama also said that &quot;the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; is to &quot;ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  O'Mara all but dared Martin's family to file a widely anticipated civil suit against Zimmerman, adding that Zimmerman might be filing lawsuits of his own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There are a number of events that happened during this case and the way certain people handled it that we may need to hold responsible. We'll see,&quot; O'Mara said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Close friends of Zimmerman told Reuters that he was deeply hurt by the way prosecutors portrayed him as a racist vigilante who targeted Martin simply because he was black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Donnelly, who testified for the defense, said Zimmerman told him: &quot;Sometimes, I have to go look at a mirror. They are talking about a totally different human being. They are talking about a racist. I'm not a racist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over dinner recently with Donnelly and his wife, Leanne Benjamin, the one-time cop wannabe said he now hopes to become a lawyer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'd like to help other people like me,&quot; Benjamin quoted him saying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said he had already contacted the Justice Department and pledged that &quot;there will be a federal civil-rights phase&quot; against Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;How is it that young Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could be killed by George Zimmerman and George Zimmerman gets no time, when Michael Vick got 2&sup1;/  years for killing dogs?&quot; Jealous fumed on CNN's &quot;State of the Union,&quot; referring to the African-American NFL star who went to jail for running dog fights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,&quot; Jealous said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) vowed that the case wasn't over yet.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think the Justice Department is going to take a look at this. This isn't over with, and I think that's good,&quot; Reid said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Reid added: &quot;I support the system. I'll accept the verdict.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton said federal charges were the next available route in the Martin family's quest for justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Clearly, there are grounds for civil-rights charges,&quot; Sharpton said on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The trial happened. The verdict came in. It does not exhaust the legal options of this family and the bigger community issues of civil rights.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a prepared statement, the Justice Department said it was evaluating &quot;the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil-rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate ,&quot; the statement added. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The popular, squeaky-clean wide receiver apologized for the ominous tweet, posted moments after Florida jurors acquitted the neighborhood-watch volunteer in the killing of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My tweet last night was my initial interpretation of the reaction I was reading on Twitter,&quot; Cruz wrote yesterday. &quot;I immediately realized my tweet was a mistake, and I apologize. That's why I deleted it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The day before, Cruz had tweeted: &quot;Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his much more conciliatory later tweet, Cruz said the tragedy of Martin's death should spark more dialogue and less violence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;I believe conversation not confrontation leads to change and progress,&quot; Cruz wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I never have and never advocate violence under any circumstances and I pray that we all encourage and educate each other.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz added that he has only kind thoughts for the victim's loved ones, saying, &quot;My prayers continue to go out to Trayvon Martin's family.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When all was said and done, the Sanford jury reached a modest conclusion: The state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman was guilty of a crime in the tragic killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not that the state didn't try. When local police and a local prosecutor found little evidence against Zimmerman, Florida's governor appointed a state attorney who ultimately charged him with second-degree murder. And when prosecutors saw their case collapsing, they desperately sought other, lesser charges: anything for a conviction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If some are now outraged by the jury's acquittal, perhaps it's because they were fed a steady political narrative about race when the evidence did not support it. One press outlet coined the term &quot;white Hispanic&quot; to describe Zimmerman. Another doctored a tape of Zimmerman's 911 call, making him sound racist when he wasn't. And now this city's mayoral candidates are chiming in to second-guess the jury and fan the flames. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The six jurors who heard all the evidence did not call George Zimmerman a hero. All they did was conclude he is not a criminal. How much better we - and the heartbroken family of Trayvon Martin - would have been if this case had not from the start been drafted into the service of other, more political agendas. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Bloomberg yesterday used the national fury over the verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting to push his anti-gun agenda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;One fact has long been crystal clear: 'Shoot first' laws, like those in Florida, can inspire dangerous vigilantism and protect those who act recklessly with guns,&quot; Hizzoner said in a statement that avoided mention of race in the controversial case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Such laws, drafted by gun-lobby extremists in Washington, encourage deadly confrontations by enabling people to shoot first and argue 'justifiable homicide' later,&quot; Bloomberg said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed child attempting to walk home from the store, will continue to drive our efforts&quot; to change those laws, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City comptroller candidates Eliot Spitzer and Scott Stringer also blasted the Florida verdict that cleared neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in the unarmed teen's death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stringer, at a Union Square rally denouncing the verdict, called the jury's decision &quot;madness.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It was sickening,&quot; he said. &quot;Being black and walking down the street is not a crime.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spitzer, the former governor and attorney general, called the verdict &quot;a failure of justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;An innocent young man was walking down a street, was confronted by a stranger with a gun, and that innocent, young man was shot. The criminal-justice system should be able to deal with situations like that. It didn't,&quot; Spitzer said on ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The city's mayoral candidates also made the rounds at churches to denounce the decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bill Thompson, the only African-American candidate, told reporters: &quot;It's not just Trayvon as a teenager. That could've been anybody who was black, anybody who was Latino.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, whose children are biracial, said the Justice Department should bring a civil case against Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This is such a slap in the face to justice,&quot; he said during the Union Square protest.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, that was fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, the jury in the George Zimmerman trial found him not guilty in the death of Trayvon Martin. By Monday, one of the six anonymous female jurors announced that she had signed on Martin Literary Management&nbsp;to shop around a book about the experience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My hope is that people will read Juror B37's book, written with her attorney husband, and understand the commitment it takes to serve and be sequestered on a jury in a highly publicized murder trial and how important, despite one's personal viewpoints, it is to follow the letter of the law,&quot; Martin Literary Management&nbsp;president&nbsp;Sharlene Martin said in a statement.&nbsp;&quot; It could open a whole new dialogue about laws that may need to be revised and revamped to suit a 21st&nbsp;century way of life.&nbsp;The reader will also learn why the jurors had no option but to find Zimmerman Not Guilty due to the manner in which he was charged and the content of the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, who has so far chosen to remain anonymous, has only been identified as Juror B37. But&nbsp;the very public trial means that some information is available about Ms. Juror B37. During the selection process, the juror revealed that she gets all her news from the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Today</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show and only uses newspapers to line parrot cages (among other things).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not known whether they will participate in any media at this time or decide to reveal their identities given the sensitivity of the verdict and the outpouring of mixed reactions by the American public,&quot; Ms. Martin said in a statement, about the juror and her attorney husband/co-author.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the juror may continue to elect to remain anonymous, writing a book about the case is one way to get on the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Today</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began as a confrontation on a rainy February night between a neighbourhood watch volunteer and a teenage boy walking home from a grocery store. But it rapidly turned into a heated and polarising national debate about race, profiling, guns and self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the Florida neighbourhood watch captain who shot and killed 17-year African American high school student Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a killing that raised major questions about race and gun control in America, was yesterday found not guilty of his murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It prompted an outpouring of outrage on twitter and protests around the US including in Washington DC, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a dramatic three-week trial and more than 16 hours of deliberation, the all-woman jury in Sanford, Florida, reached a not guilty verdict after deciding that the 29-year-old had acted in self-defence when he shot and killed Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman remained expressionless as the verdict was read out with his family members smiling broadly. The Martin family, who had pushed so publicly for an investigation into their son&quot;s death, were not in the court as the verdict was read out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge told Zimmerman he was free to go, telling him that the GPS beacon that had been tracking him while on bail would be switched off as he left the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We&quot;re ecstatic with the results,&quot; defence lawyer Mark O&quot;Mara said after the verdict. &quot;George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of his defence team, Don West, said he was pleased the jury &quot;kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting in a gated community in a town of 50,000 people 50km north of Orlando, caused a national public outcry last year after the Martin family and civil rights leaders alleged police had failed to properly investigate Zimmerman, who was not arrested until 44 days after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black teenager had been walking to his father&quot;s house after buying some sweets at the local shop when he was seen by Zimmerman, who called the police but ignored the orders of police dispatchers not to confront the boy. A fight then ensured during which Zimmerman shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the shooting caused a furore which led to the sacking of Sanford&quot;s white police chief, even drawing in President Barack Obama who said that if he had a son &quot;he&quot;d look like Trayvon&quot;, sparking a national debate over race relations in America more than 20 years after the infamous beating of Rodney King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as time passed and more details emerged about Zimmerman, whose mother is Hispanic, the racial tensions surrounding the case eased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family&quot;s demands for a full investigation and trial were met and a new, black police chief, Cecil Smith, was installed in Sanford with a mission to promote even-handed policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, supporters of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;s family gathered outside the court to await the verdict expressed anger and disappointment at the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernie de la Rionda, the assistant state attorney who was the chief prosecutor in the case against Zimmerman, said he and his two fellow prosecutors were unhappy about the outcome of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am disappointed, as we are, with the verdict. But we accept it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We live in a great country that has a great criminal justice system. It&quot;s not perfect, but it is the best in the world Call for calm after not-guilty verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and we respect the jury&quot;s verdict,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the verdict both families, civil rights leaders including Jesse Jackson, and local police had all called for a calm response to a case that has riveted America over the last three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial turned on several key defence witnesses who appeared to support Zimmerman&quot;s claims that he had acted in self-defence and shot Martin as an act of last resort after the teenager banged his head repeatedly into the concrete pavement, a claim consistent with his head injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the most telling testimonies, forensic pathologist Vincent DiMaio said that examination of the bullet wound had supported Zimmerman&quot;s contention that Martin was on top, straddling him during the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also central to the trial was the question of whether it was Zimmerman or Martin that was heard screaming for help on an emergency call moments before the fatal shot was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts from the FBI ruled that with Martin dead, it was impossible to prove scientifically who was screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among some black residents of Sandford, there was anger and sadness at the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders have added their calls for calm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama says he knows the not-guilty verdict reached late Saturday has elicited strong passions around the U.S. In a statement released Sunday, Obama is asking that all Americans respect the call for calm reflection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) From New York to California, outrage over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager poured from street demonstrations and church pulpits Sunday as protesters called for justice for the victim and demanded federal civil rights charges against the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests were planned later Sunday in Boston, Detroit, Baltimore, San Francisco and other cities over the Florida case, which unleashed a national debate over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. One protest in California hours after the verdict late Saturday ended with vandalism while police dispersed another crowd by firing beanbag rounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, the Justice Department said it is looking into the case to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney&quot;s office for the Middle District of Florida are evaluating evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin a tragedy for the country and urged calm reflection, a message shared by religious and civil rights leaders hoping to ensure peaceful demonstrations in the wake of a case that became an emotional flash point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan, congregants at Middle Collegiate Church were encouraged to wear hooded sweatshirts in memory of Martin, who was wearing a hoodie the night he was shot to death in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Jacqueline Lewis, wearing a pink hoodie, urged peace and told her congregation that slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. &quot;would have wanted us to conduct ourselves on the highest plane of dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she added, &quot;we&quot;re going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congregant Jessica Nacinovich, wearing a hoodie, said she could only feel disappointment and sadness over the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just wanted to come and be here with everybody in solidarity and talk and pray and sing about where we go from here,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a youth service in Sanford, Florida, where the trial was held, teens wearing shirts displaying Martin&quot;s picture wiped away tears during a sermon at the St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after the verdict, demonstrators gathered on U Street in Washington, D.C., chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; One protester carried a sign that read, &quot;Stop criminalizing black men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, about 200 demonstrators marched through downtown Tallahassee carrying signs that said &quot;Racism is Not Dead&quot; and &quot;Who&quot;s Next?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chicago, black clergy members called for calm, with the Rev. Ira Acree of Greater St. John Bible Church saying the community should become &quot;a united voice for peace&quot; because it can&quot;t control the verdict but it &quot;can control our streets and communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 200 people turned out for a rally and march in downtown Chicago, saying the verdict was symbolic of lingering racism in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-three-year-old Maya Miller said the case reminded her of the 1955 slaying of Emmitt Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago who was murdered by a group of white men while visiting Mississippi. Till&quot;s killing galvanized the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller said she felt as if &quot;nothing has changed in 58 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Association for the Advance of Colored People, a leading civil rights organization, called for the opening of a civil rights case against Zimmerman in an online petition addressed to Attorney General Eric Holder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, urged peace in the wake of the verdict. Jackson said the legal system &quot;failed justice,&quot; but violence isn&quot;t the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all the protesters heeded those calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, California, some angry demonstrators broke windows, burned U.S. flags and started street fires. Some marchers also vandalized a police squad car and used spray paint to scrawl anti-police graffiti on roads and Alameda County&quot;s Davidson courthouse. In Los Angeles, police said a crowd of about 100 protesters surrounded an officer and two people threw bottles when more police arrived. The officers used beanbag rounds to disperse the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most protests were peaceful, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan&quot;s Union Square, hundreds of people gathered to voice their passions over the verdict, hoisting placards with images of Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some tempered their anger, saying they didn&quot;t contest the jury&quot;s decision based on the legal issues involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;while the verdict may be legal, a system that doesn&quot;t take into account what happened is a broken legal system,&quot; said Jennifer Lue, 24, an Asian-American resident of Harlem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone should feel about this, whether you&quot;re Asian-American or African-American,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alec Baldwin has returned to Twitter to denounce George Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star slammed the door on his account late last month after an explosive rant aimed at a journalist who had accused his wife of tweeting during James Gandolfini&quot;s funeral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently the not guilty verdict announced at the weekend in Zimmerman&quot;s case was enough to prompt Baldwin&quot;s resurgence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star kept it brief when commenting on the outcome of the trial, which saw Zimmerman, 29, charged with second-degree murder in the death of an unarmed 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin was gunned down near his home in Sanford, Florida in February 2012 and the defendant, a Hispanic American, had been accused of racially profiling the teen, who was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida is a parallel universe. A f***ed up one.&quot; Baldwin wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His note came about 90 minutes after the verdict was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baldwin&quot;s previous rant was deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star came under fire last month for what some called &quot;homophobic&quot; comments aimed at a male reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baldwin declared the MailOnline journalist a &quot;toxic little queen&quot; for erroneously reporting about his wife&quot;s alleged tweets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much of this sh** are people supposed to take? With these f***ing blatant lies EVERY DAY,&quot; Baldwin tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife DID NOT use her phone, in any capacity, at our friends funeral. Now, f*** this twitter + good luck to all of you who know the truth (sic),&quot; he continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MailOnline later admitted to the error, blaming a &quot;Twitter bug&quot; in the website&quot;s timestamp system for the report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) The U.S. neighborhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager is now a free man, but the Justice Department said it is looking into Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;s death to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama and numerous celebrities expressed sorrow at the verdict, which has led to largely peaceful protests across the country by civil rights leaders and others. Hundreds gathered in New York&quot;s Times Square and in Los Angeles on Sunday, some chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles police said they began making arrests early Monday morning after about 80 protesters gathered in Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard and an unlawful assembly was declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 Los Angeles police officers in riot gear converged on the crowd and ordered people to disperse. Police said they made seven arrests throughout the day, The Los Angeles Times reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, California, police confronted a crowd at a downtown intersection after a small crowd began breaking windows and spray painting graffiti Sunday night, the Oakland Tribune reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February 2012 shooting first drew national attention when Zimmerman wasn&quot;t arrested for weeks, and the case has continued to raise questions over race and self-defense gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury late Saturday found the 29-year-old Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and declined to convict him on a lesser charge of manslaughter. Zimmerman has said he shot the 17-year-old in self-defense in a nighttime confrontation in his Florida gated community, where Martin was visiting family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were told that Zimmerman was allowed to use deadly force when he shot the teen not only if he actually faced death or bodily harm, but also if he merely thought he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With many critics angry over Zimmerman&quot;s acquittal, his freedom may be limited. He may also face civil lawsuits from Martin&quot;s family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He&quot;s going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; his brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr. told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama called Martin&quot;s death a tragedy for America but asked that everyone respect calls for calm reflection. It was a rare statement from the president on a case that doesn&quot;t directly involve the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Attorney General Eric Holder called the killing was a &quot;tragic, unnecessary shooting&quot; and that it provides an opportunity for the nation to speak honestly about complicated and emotionally charged issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department says the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and federal prosecutors in Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, plus evidence and testimony from the state trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama would not involve himself in decisions by the Justice Department on whether to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman because it would inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many, including Martin&quot;s parents, said Zimmerman had racially profiled Martin. Zimmerman, whose mother was born in Peru, identifies as Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s family has maintained the teen was not the aggressor, and prosecutors suggested Martin was scared because he was being followed by a stranger. Defense attorneys, however, said Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man&quot;s head against the sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors portrayed Zimmerman as a vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men. Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department opened an investigation into Martin&quot;s death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and the local U.S. Attorney&quot;s office are continuing to evaluate the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has a long history of using federal civil rights law in an effort to convict defendants who have previously been acquitted in related state cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But experience has shown it&quot;s almost never easy getting convictions in such high-profile prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Vinegrad, a former U.S. Attorney, said federal prosecutors &quot;would have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr. Zimmerman attacked Mr. Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court did not release the racial and ethnic makeup of the six-person jury, but the panel appeared to reporters to be made up of five white women and a sixth who may be Hispanic. The jurors did not talk to reporters after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--New Haven County residents said the lasting effects of the George Zimmernan not guilty verdict is the concern race relations will worsen along with questions about the judicial system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriel Roman and his wife, Judy, of Seymour felt &quot;justice wasn't served for Trayvon Martin and his family. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judy Roman said she believes this will cause a rift between the different races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not just blacks and whites, but any race,&quot; Seymour said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thinking of it as a parent, you would want justice to be served,&quot; Gabriel Roman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judy Roman said she followed the case closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a feeling he would be found not guilty,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Betty Welch of Milford was surprised the jury reached a not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he should have been held accountable for something. I'm always disappointed when justice isn't served,&quot; Welch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie, of Milford felt the verdict was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think there was enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. I personally would have been upset if he was found guilty,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephanie, who declined to give her last name, said she didn't believe the not guilty verdict would affect her life moving forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siblings Rasheem and Rashida Robinson of East Haven said the verdict forced them to lose more faith in the country's justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Regardless of race, a crime was committed and he should have went to jail,&quot; Rashida Robinson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just seems like justice wasn't served,&quot; Rasheem Robinson added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deborah Stewart of New Haven referred to the case as &quot;terrible&quot; and a &quot;travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart talked about a racial experience a family member had in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was coming out of the bowling alley with her family and there were people outside calling them the &quot;n-word,&quot; people think prejudice doesn't exist anymore but it does,&quot; Stewart said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This really does affect our everyday lives,&quot; Stewart said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hats off to Flagler County Sheriff Jim Manfre, who in a recent interview outlined four future programs to reduce crime and possibly provide a homeless shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first three programs, as fitting the sheriff's office, would be to provide counseling, work release and a halfway house for prisoners. The fourth future program would be to provide a home for the homeless. Never have I heard any public official propose such a program. The possibility for saving the 30 percent of &quot;down-on- their-luck&quot; homeless would not only be a social benefit but also an economic one as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The space for some of the above could be the vacated buildings due to the new prison and the relocation of the sheriff's office. It's not too early to plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palm Coast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just follow the law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently a resident of Palm Coast wrote about doing away with red- light cameras in Palm Coast. What is the problem with these cameras? Is it that drivers feel the need to run red lights and don't want to pay the fine for getting caught? Or is it the act of making a right- hand turn at 12-14 mph, as stated in a letter on July 8, while pulling out in front of a driver who probably has the right of way? The statue states you may turn right on red after coming to a complete stop, looking for oncoming traffic, and -- if no vehicle is coming -- making a right turn on red. This does not mean turning right after slowing down to 12-14 mph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you don't want to get a ticket, there is a small pedal on the floor next to your accelerator that you can push -- and you will not get a ticket. I know; I have used this pedal for more than 50 years and I have never gotten a ticket for running a red light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are in such a hurry that you cannot stop at a red light, leave home five minutes earlier and you will get where you are going at the time you need to be there. Remember, if you are the victim of a red-light runner and you are seriously injured, was the complaining worth the pain? So my advice to everyone is stop complaining and press the brake pedal when the light turns red! Remember, driving is a privilege granted by the state, and not a right. Privileges can be taken away if you don't obey the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daytona Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spaceport still a 'no'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I attended the spaceport meeting in New Smyrna Beach on June 25. I wish to thank Capt. Scott Tripp and all the knowledgeable professionals for their passionate pleas to save our lagoon system from the boondoggle that was presented by those who do not live on our lagoon, love our lagoon, or make their living on our lagoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, a clear message: We do not want a spaceport at Shiloh. Period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider these statements by Volusia County Councilwoman Deb Denys:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- We are going &quot;where we have not gone before.&quot; Yes we have -- it's called Kennedy Space Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oak Hill is ripe for enterprise.&quot; Please ask any of us if we want our pristine area turned into a toxic soup mess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the statement by Dale Ketcham of Space Florida that there had been no commercial space flights from Florida. Elon Musk's supply missions were such -- and launched from Florida's existing launch pads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also consider this: The federal government seized land for the KSC &quot;buffer area&quot; not only from the state of Florida, but also from private home owners. Environmental impact studies have already been determined at KSC. The audacity to request the Federal Aviation Administration conduct a study on land that Space Florida doesn't own is a waste of taxpayer money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why state that the existing shuttle landing facility would be appropriate for Space Florida to use, but not the existing launch pads. How are these two sites not synonymous entities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ketcham's title is &quot;chief of strategic alliances.&quot; Why doesn't he start working on an alliance with NASA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a collective arrogant attitude and waste of tax dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two possible legacies. First, we destroy a fragile ecosystem. Or second, we saved, for eternity, our fragile ecosystem and all who hold it as life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will remain optimistic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edgewater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resolve conflicts with words</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If George Zimmerman were trained in basic conflict resolution techniques and strategies on how to deal with difficult and challenging people, he may have been able to defuse the situation without violence. If he knew how to approach Trayvon Martin without causing anger and suspicion, the result may have been different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, it appears, relied on the fact that he had a firearm if push literally came to shove. He had no need to develop his communication skills because he apparently knew how to fight and use a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, if Martin learned the same things as part of his education or upbringing and did not resort immediately to violence, the results certainly would have been different. Talking it over, working it out, throwing out some words instead of throwing hands can work. It's worth a try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palm Coast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep natural gas in U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to your editorial on fracking and its potential, we need to delve deeper. Unlike oil, traded in the global market, natural gas is not attached to a daily benchmark. But natural gas has become a strategic resource that the U.S. should develop with the goal of increased domestic consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to think beyond using gas to power our utility companies. For example, natural gas is extensively used in the production of fertilizers -- and it's disheartening to learn most of our nitrogen and potash, in fertilizer form, comes from imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been two decades since ground was broken here in the U.S. on any new ammonia plants. Now is the time. My understanding is there are 14 new plants on the horizon in five states, with upward of $10 billion invested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding the recent explosion and tragic loss of lives at the fertilizer plant in West, Texas, we need to ramp up production domestically. Aside from creating construction jobs -- and later permanent jobs in each plant -- our farming industry would benefit from local sources of fertilizer, in turn benefiting U.S. consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet I fear natural gas producers will simply move their product to overseas markets in pursuit of more profit, to counter the low prices we enjoy now. I am reading that billions of dollars are being invested in liquefied natural gas plants to export the gas on massive ships to overseas markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It just seems incongruous to me that we would take a dynamic, cheap resource such as natural gas, found literally under our feet, liquefy it and send it to markets in Asia or India before fully exploiting it here at home. Fracking has created an opportunity for our country's advancement. Let's not scupper it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local clergy and the NAACP will hold a rally Saturday in Daytona Beach as part of a nationwide drive urging federal prosecutors to charge George Zimmerman with violating the civil rights of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin when he shot the teen to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo Galleries </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zimmerman Trial Reaction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. L. Ronald Durham of Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Daytona Beach, as well as other area clergy and the local NAACP chapter, will hold a &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; National Day of Action Vigil. Rev. Al Sharpton called for the rallies in at least 100 cities with the local one set for noon Saturday in front of the 5th District Court of Appeal, 300 S. Beach St.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a rally that Rev. Sharpton asked us all for last night,&quot; Durham said Monday. &quot;We're hoping this will jump-start the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rallies aim to convince the U.S. Department of Justice to press criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman for fatally shooting the 17-year-old youth who was unarmed and carried only Skittles and iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first comments since Zimmerman's acquittal Saturday night, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that Martin's parents have suffered a pain that no parent should have to endure. Holder said Monday that Martin's killing was a &quot;tragic, unnecessary shooting&quot; and that the youth's death provides an opportunity for the nation to speak honestly about complicated and emotionally charged issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the Justice Department said it is reviewing evidence in the case to determine whether criminal civil rights charges are warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham said there is solid support in Washington by members of the Congressional Black Caucus to urge Holder to file the civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham said that he and about 200 other pastors from around the nation were on a conference call with Sharpton on Sunday night concerning the Zimmerman verdict and the Justice for Trayvon National Day of Action Vigil. Sharpton will not attend the Daytona Beach rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press release Durham said: &quot;If we don't act now, to stem the far reaching implications for the verdict in this trial, anyone can now find themselves followed or confronted by a stranger, and when asked 'why are you following me?' can be shot using this ruling as the basis of their defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted of second degree murder and manslaughter late Saturday night in a Seminole County courtroom by a jury of six women. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer at his townhouse community in Sanford, fatally shot Martin in February 2012 after he and the unarmed teen -- dressed in a hooded sweatshirt which has become a symbol for protesters -- got into a physical confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case quickly became about race - Martin was black, Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is from Peru -- after several civil rights leaders said Zimmerman racially profiled Martin when he saw him walking along a sidewalk in his community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman maintained that he shot the youth in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict delivered Saturday after 10 p.m. sparked several mostly peaceful demonstrations in various cities across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal shows the inequality in the justice system, said Cynthia Slater, president of the NAACP for Volusia County and the second vice president of the Florida State Conference NAACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a senseless death,&quot; Slater said. &quot;We have to look at the whole criminal justice system and how African-Americans and other minorities are treated when it comes to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham is collaborating with Rev. Troy Bradley of Greater Union First Baptist Church in DeLand, who said he would be putting the word out about Saturday's rally to various pastors in the DeLand area, as well as in DeLeon Springs and Osteen. Bradley said any member of his church is welcome to attend the rally and transportation will be provided by the church if needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham is asking that young people attending the rally Saturday to wear a hoodie and take a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search for justice in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin began in the winter of 2012 amid accusations that the authorities in Sanford were racially biased and unable to see the truth in a case of likely racial profiling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within weeks the search detoured into a heated national debate over guns and Florida's controversial stand your ground self- defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer accused of second-degree murder in Martin's death came to trial, the search had become a nationally televised court drama accompanied by endless analysis and commentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now the search, conducted throughout in the glare of the media spotlight, has ended with the two-word judgment of a jury of Zimmerman's peers: not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases ultimately aren't tried in the court of public opinion. A jury's verdict is the definitive finding in our system. In any criminal or civil case, we can argue about the evidence and its implications, but a jury verdict should always command public respect and acceptance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the public digests the final outcome of the case, all should heed the words of Monzell Ford, a Daytona Beach pastor who went to Sanford Saturday to await the verdict. &quot;Hate has no place in this right now,&quot; Ford said. &quot;Our nation already is too divided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some felt a guilty verdict was the only acceptable outcome. After all, a teenager died for reasons that will forever remain clouded. But Martin's race did not affect the resolve of the special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Rick Scott. The case was thoroughly investigated and vigorously prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's trial went on for almost three weeks, and jurors heard testimony from 56 witnesses. Despite being sequestered throughout the trial, the jurors didn't rush to judgment: they deliberated for more than 15 hours before reaching a verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the jury apparently saw what many courtroom observers and legal experts saw -- the overall weakness of the case against George Zimmerman. With the lack of detailed eyewitness testimony concerning the scuffle between Martin and Zimmerman, there was room for reasonable doubt about Zimmerman's guilt. And in our system of justice, the state must prove charges beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who feel the trial did not produce justice now are pinning their hopes on a U.S. Justice Department investigation of civil rights violations in Martin's death. That may be a fruitless probe, given that the state's prosecutors were unable to find evidence that Zimmerman was motivated by racial animus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most important thing now is for all to accept the jury's verdict, even if they do not agree with it. Justice is administered in a courtroom, not on the streets or on TV talk shows. The justice system isn't perfect, but it worked as designed in the trial of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Mr Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict. Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court,'' Judge Deborah Nelson said after the decision was read.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--Monday again, here comes another work week...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weather: Scattered showers continue. Another typical summertime day, as we'll have a 30 percent chance of scattered showers, mainly in the afternoon, with highs in the middle 80s. Scattered showers continue tonight with lows in the lower 70s. Skies will clear on Tuesday with highs near 90. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman verdict reaction continues. Barely 36 hours after a six-woman jury in Sanford, Florida returned a not-guilty verdict against George Zimmerman, reaction was fairly subdued from those opposed to the verdict, though scattered violent acts occurred in Oakland, California. Zimmerman was acquitted Saturday night of second-degree murder charges in the killing of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager he confronted as a neighborhood-watch captain. &quot;We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,&quot; President Obama said Sunday in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over-filled pickup flips, two killed. A pickup truck carrying 10 or more children flipped over in a two-vehicle crash north of Guntersville, killing two and injuring nine. No word on what caused the crash. Alabama does not have laws restricting riding in the open beds of pickups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports: A new home run king? It could be, as Chris Davis set a new Major League Baseball record by hitting 37 homers before the All-Star Game break. That puts the Baltimore slugger within reach of 61, the single-season record set by Roger Maris that many baseball purists consider to still be the &quot;real&quot; record, as Barry Bonds' mark of 73 and Mark McGuire's 70 are considered tainted due to allegations of performance-enhancing drugs. Davis will be featured in tonight's MLB Home Run Derby at New York's Citi Field... NASCAR: Brain Vickers, a Sprint Cup part-timer splitting time with Mark Martin, won his first race since 2009 Sunday at Loudon, N.H. Vickers held off Kyle Busch for the win. Also making news was 71-year-old Morgan Shepherd, who became the oldest driver ever to start a race in NASCAR's top series; he finished 41st... Golf: And at the other end of the age spectrum we find Jordan Spieth, who at age 19 became the first teenager to win a PGA tour event since 1931. Spieth won the John Deere Classic on Sunday in a three-way playoff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the group's success at garnering capacity crowds year after year, it isn't far-fetched to argue that returning British reggae band Steel Pulse was the perfect choice to spark up another run of shows at Pacific Amphitheatre this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outfit's members - anchored consistently by vocalists David Hinds and Selwyn Brown, plus masterful keyboardist Sidney Mills - are veterans of their craft, delivering ample, uplifting hits spanning nearly four decades of rockin' steady.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appearance Saturday saw them in top form, bringing an air of infectious glee to their 16-song set that spread through the audience like convivial contagion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the droves of fans (many clad in black, gold, red and green) who packed in for this opening Saturday night of the OC Fair's five-week season hit a high point even before the headliners took the stage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite literally, actually: many of them ignited copious amounts of cannabis early on while Santa Barbara-based, Hawaii-bred band Iration blazed through a short opening set of upbeat, tropical-tinged tunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with a few carefree cuts from just-released third album &quot;Automatic,&quot; the group did good by playing to the crowd's lifted spirits with a sunny cover of Tom Petty's &quot;Mary Jane's Last Dance.&quot; Bonus for local music fans: one of Dana Point's most down-home artists, Micah Brown, sat in as backup singer and occasional lead guitarist for the entire set. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its audience well-buzzed in advance, Steel Pulse had no trouble enhancing the veritably vivacious vibe. Hinds &amp; Co. settled in with a strategic set that began with a few revered pop-reggae hits to get people moving: &quot;Prodigal Son,&quot; &quot;Roller Skates&quot; and the Marcus Garvey-eulogizing &quot;Worth His Weight in Gold (Rally Round).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, true to their more serious activist undertones, they rocked through some slow-burning protest songs, including the passionately sung &quot;No More Weapons,&quot; the Kingston-meets-Motown feel of &quot;A Who Responsible&quot; and the hip-hop-infused &quot;Drug Squad,&quot; which came off equally fun-loving as saxophonist Jerry Johnson captivatingly crushed his extended jazzy solo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while &quot;Steppin' Out&quot; marked the hardiest party point near the end of a four-song encore - &quot;That's why we'll love you forever!&quot; shouted Hinds in reaction to an overpowering sing-along on the chorus - the show concluded with a timely social message. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pausing to wish backing vocalist and dancer Keysha McTaggert a happy birthday, the frontman segued to something more somber: &quot;Speaking of anniversaries, it's been 100 years since the birth of Rosa Parks ... and coming up on 50 years in August since (Martin Luther King Jr.'s) 'I Have a Dream Speech,' &quot; he mentioned, dipping into the acoustic-led &quot;Let Freedom Ring.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hinds reiterated that intimation shortly before the end: &quot;I'm sad to say that 100 years after the birth of Rosa Parks, we're still out here in the streets fighting for justice. ... This last song is a special tribute to Trayvon Martin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that, the group launched into recently released single &quot;Put Your Hoodies On,&quot; poignantly capturing the outfit's penchant for embedding social consciousness within cool, spirit-elevating grooves. Safe to say this audience was feeling the intoxicating result on all levels.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said, referring to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges - a verdict that stunned the black community and civil rights groups and spurred largely peaceful protests in the streets in several cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury accepted that Zimmerman had acted in selfdefence when he shot and killed Martin as the teenager walked to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot; A fight ensured during which he shot Martin dead. Zimmerman,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman's been acquitted in the state case. The department launched a probe a year ago but stepped aside to allow Florida's prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents are also considering a wrongful-death civil suit against Zimmerman. Sixteen years ago, O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay $25 million in compensation to Nicole Brown Simpson's family members despite his acquittal in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many blacks saw overt racism in Zimmerman's focus on a black boy wearing a hoodie as he walked through a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, many argued this weekend, proves the criminal justice system is still inherently biased against black people given Martin, the unarmed slaying victim, was successfully portrayed as the aggressor in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As worshipers began filing into Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church, youth pastor Kevin Jones, whose duty it was to give the sermon the morning after the George Zimmerman verdict, shook his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, he would not be addressing the not-guilty verdict in his sermon, he said softly. Back in 2012, when neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Jones was one of many black pastors who expressed their sadness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones climbed the steep steps of the venerable church in the north-end Sapodilla neighborhood, a center of black community and commerce for nearly a century, going back to the days when black and white people officially lived apart. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the steps, the arc of racial justice is steep. It requires pacing oneself, rather than bleeding out in rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Jones' decision not to feed the distress and anger there might be in his flock, the verdict was on their minds. Zimmerman, a white Hispanic man, had gone free after shooting the unarmed black teenager on a street in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralph Pittman Sr., another Tabernacle minister, was urging a small group of well-dressed women in the front pews to focus not on what may have been lost, but what still remains: &quot;We still have hope,&quot; he said. Amen to that. The middle-aged women nodded in agreement that they had all been through worse and survived it, in terms of civil rights struggles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to look at where you have come from,&quot; he advised them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indicating his dark, striped Sunday suit, he said: &quot;I wasn't always like this. Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above the vestibule the words of the psalmist said it another way:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call on the Lord in my distress and he answers me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman case hit almost all of the sourest notes in American society: race, profiling, self-defense laws and guns. Not surprisingly, opinions were strong, emotions were high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the White House released a statement from President Barack Obama that said, in part, &quot;The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Trump, sometime presidential candidate, Palm Beach resident and erstwhile &quot;birther,&quot; delivered a relatively measured tweet: &quot;Zimmerman is no angel but the lack of evidence and the concept of self-defense, especially in Florida law, gave the jury little other choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everett Wilkinson, the head of the National Liberty Foundation, formerly the Florida Tea Party, called the verdict fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman should never have been arrested or even tried,&quot; Wilkinson said. &quot;The media got a hold of it and the race-baiters like Al Sharpton and portrayed him as this racist monster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilkinson said he still absolutely supports the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law which, while not a direct issue in the Zimmerman case, was considered one of the key factors in it. He added that in the future, it was possible that someone might confront Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He might be out somewhere, and he has the right to pull a gun and defend himself, but I hope we don't see a repeat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Beverly Elliot-Morrison woke up on Sunday morning after spending much of Saturday glued to her computer for news on the jury's deliberations, she had a case of verdict hangover: Yes, it was still true -- Zimmerman was exonerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the family reunion she was attending in Albany, Ga., the Zimmerman trial was on everyone's minds since they arrived on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing I thought of was Michael Vick,&quot; she said, referring to the pro football player who got a 23-month jail sentence for running a dog-fighting operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A kid is walking down the street and is shot and killed by a person that profiled him, and that person gets nothing. It makes you think that the life of a dog is more important than the life of a little child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrison, who felt so strongly about the case that she led a busload of local residents on a protest in Sanford last year, was consoled by, of all people, her 19-year-old grandson in a Facebook exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wrote on Facebook, 'This is unbelievable, I'm in tears, I'm really surprised there is still not justice.' And Nikalas wrote, 'Grandma, it's up to God. Just because you're not behind bars doesn't mean you're free. He's got to face this for the rest of his life.'~HOA~128~128~&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nikalas Chappell, at age 19, is the same age that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would have been . And he doesn't kid himself that just because he's a college student in Philadelphia he doesn't have to stay alert .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Racial profile is used every second of the day,&quot; Chappell said. &quot;That thought is always in my head. You can't be too careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks sees the underlying problem as the stand your ground law, which has been extended to allow more leeway in what is considered self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The laws and social norms are very much pushing people to escalate aggression, and there is never a good result from that,&quot; Franks said. &quot;It's a terrible situation to find yourself in as a community, with a law that irresponsibly encourages citizens to use weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Franks recalled that Joe Horn was acquitted after shooting two burglars in the back as they were robbing a neighbor's house in Texas, which has a law similar to stand your ground. Like Zimmerman, Horn was told by a 911 operator not to confront the burglars. Horn told the 911 operator that he had the right to shoot them because of the law, which had just been enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An elderly man bleeding profusely from a cut on his head sat on a chair on the side of a street in Goldsboro just two blocks from a new Sanford police station Sunday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to witnesses, the man's face was bloodied when he fell after being hit with a stun gun in the back of the head while trying to flee police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbors in the historically black community were incensed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're profiling the neighborhood,&quot; Charlie Carter shouted. &quot;I'm tired of them profiling the neighborhood. I don't need that much police protection. They need to back their butts off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after George Zimmerman walked out of the Seminole County Courthouse a free man, the incident illustrates the powder-keg tension between police and residents in the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police did not respond to requests to confirm the accounts of neighbors, who said more than 10 minutes passed before an ambulance was called for the injured man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the incident sparked outrage from more than a dozen Goldsboro residents, who said the situation in Sanford is close to the boiling point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An inch. Less than a centimeter away,&quot; Carlos Walker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when a Sanford Fire Department officer kicked over the empty chair that had been occupied by the man, neighbors viewed it as a poke in the eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He did not need to do that,&quot; Alkini Ranking said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days earlier, Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger told reporters from around the country that &quot;there is no tension in Seminole County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many blacks, Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watch captain, is indistinguishable from a certified law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ranking and others are convinced that the Zimmerman verdict combined with a bitter legacy of racism in Sanford is a recipe for disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black community of Goldsboro incorporated as a city in 1891. Twenty years later, Sanford absorbed the city as part of its westward expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1946, Jackie Robinson played his first minor-league baseball game in Sanford before becoming the first black man ever to play in the major leagues. White fans booed him off the field, and the police chief threatened to cancel the game if Robinson played. Robinson was forced to leave town twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This hasn't just started. It's been going on for years. Trayvon (Martin) just opened doors up to let people know what's gone on here,&quot; Ranking said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford and throughout the nation, black clergy used the pulpit to push their parishioners to turn their rage and disappointment into determination and civic action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Pastor Lowman Oliver, the death of Martin and the verdict was &quot;reminiscent of the days of old school&quot; and his marches a half-century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got up and told the world this is not right. We're not going to be putting up with this stuff no more,&quot; Oliver preached to at least 50 churchgoers during Youth Day services Sunday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the faces of the few young black men before him, Oliver said he wonders who is going to take his place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I let this exist then all of them, when they go to the store, are subject to get shot,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the next generation of clergy did not seem as optimistic that the Zimmerman case and Martin's death would spark significant changes for blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what we can do right now,&quot; Crystal Haynes, the church's youth coordinator, said while dishing out chicken, baked beans and macaroni and cheese in the church hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't feel like justice was served. What can we do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver's answer was to walk in the footsteps of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I consider this as another civil rights movement,&quot; Oliver said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus now needs to be on gun laws and racial profiling, he said. He noted to his parish that the Department of Justice already received hundreds of petitions asking for an investigation into the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When are we going to stop this kind of nonsense?&quot; Oliver said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many blacks say something needs to be done, most are not sure exactly what that is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threats of violence and vandalism won't help, said Jalaneia Evans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the end of the day, someone's going to be without, and then there's going to be another case. We've got to leave it up to God,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's not guilty verdict may put an end to the case, said Justin Carter of Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's nothing we can really do about this situation,&quot; Carter said. &quot;But we can't be silent. If we're silent, nothing will be fixed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphonso Carter saw nothing out of the ordinary in the George Zimmerman trial verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never go in a white neighborhood,&quot; the 15-year-old from Delray Beach said. &quot;They always think we're gonna steal.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other young people out and about Sunday in Lake Worth and West Palm Beach -- some of them the same age as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year-old black teenager Zimmerman was acquitted of killing late Saturday -- saw the verdict the same way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Carter and other Palm Beach County youths, the Zimmerman trial was all about race, and the prejudice they see in Zimmerman's decisions the night Martin died is a part of their daily lives, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Marshall of Lake Worth simply didn't see the logic behind the jury's verdict, saying that if he was in a position similar to Martin's, he would have fought back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got to protect myself,&quot; said Marshall, 25. &quot;If you're trailing me and you're not a police officer, then I don't know who you are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellison Robins, also of Lake Worth, distilled the case to what he saw as its bare elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just see a white man shooting a black boy and getting off,&quot; Robins, 20, said outside of the predominately black Lake Worth Church of God after Sunday's service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And both the verdict and the culture he lives in teach him to be careful. He said he has to second-guess how he carries himself in public and make an effort for people to trust that he's not a &quot;bad kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just makes it hard,&quot; Robins said. &quot;After a while you can put people into a position where they want to do wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some say it's time for the media to move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I swear to God, I thought this was over last year,&quot; said Russell Read, 19, of Coconut Creek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing outside the Cruzan Amphitheatre, awaiting a performance by New Orleans rap artist Lil' Wayne, Read said the media are distracting the public from more important events around the world. And besides, not everything was known about the night Martin died, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for me to believe that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin wasn't doing something wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm sure he was looking around, doing something sketch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When attorney Craig Lawson got up Sunday morning, he had one of the most difficult tasks of his legal career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had to explain to his 14-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son how a Seminole County jury could have decided that George Zimmerman was not guilty of the February 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was walking from a convenience store with a bag of Skittles and a can of tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a lawyer, Lawson said he could explain how difficult it is to win a conviction when, as in this case, there were no eyewitnesses, and when the person on trial claims he acted in self-defense, as Zimmerman did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He could explain how reasonable doubt is a high standard -- one that protects innocent people from being unjustly convicted. He could explain that even though there are rules that require that juries represent a cross section of the community, it just happened the one in Sanford that acquitted Zimmerman was composed of women, only one of whom -- described as Hispanic or black -- wasn't white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as a black man, looking at the confused and frightened faces of his children, Lawson said he was hard-pressed to argue that the jury verdict was fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The system doesn't look at us fairly. There's nothing new about this,&quot; he said. His advice to young African-Americans: &quot;You have to be careful out there. You have to be vigilant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys Chris Haddad and John Howe said they would give all young people the same advice, particularly in light of a 2005 National Rifle Association-backed state law that gives gun owners broad power to use deadly force if they believe they are in danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worst message that comes out of (the acquittal) is if you have a gun, not only should you shoot the person but you should kill them,&quot; said Howe, the first black president of the Palm Beach County Bar Association. &quot;You have every incentive to shoot them and kill them because then that person isn't there to refute your version of events.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haddad agreed. &quot;The law has evolved so people with guns have a far greater right to use them,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as this law remains on the books, these types of things are going to continue to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman didn't ask Seminole County Circuit Judge Debra Nelson to clear him on the basis of the state's now infamous &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. In the wake of the national uproar that surrounded Martin's killing, Gov. Rick Scott appointed a panel of lawyers, law enforcement officials and Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Krista Marx to review it. They essentially affirmed the law, but suggested that members of neighborhood watch groups, like Zimmerman, shouldn't be allowed to &quot;pursue, confront or provoke potential suspects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zimmerman didn't specifically invoke the law in his defense, it was part of the jury instructions. The six jurors were told they could acquit Zimmerman if they believed that he was justified in using deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson told the six: &quot;If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the law was passed, such rights extended only to a person's home under the legal theory that a person's home is his castle, Haddad said. Even then, people had a duty to retreat, even if it meant only closing the door to keep an intruder from getting inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the stand your ground law, Zimmerman could invoke it anywhere he had a legal right to be. Further, he could argue that he believed he faced the possibility of &quot;death or great bodily harm&quot; even if others might question the danger he faced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to put yourself in the role of the person of what they perceived, even if it might not have been accurate,&quot; attorney Michael Salnick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, the jury was instructed: &quot;The danger facing George Zimmerman need not have been actual. ... Based upon appearances, George Zimmerman must have actually believed that the danger was real,&quot; according to the instruction that guided the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many have argued that Zimmerman set the wheels in motion by getting out of his truck and apparently chasing Martin, even after a police dispatcher told him to stay put, Salnick and other attorneys said there is nothing inherently sinister about a neighborhood watch volunteer approaching someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking at it as a human being, I wished he had never gotten out of his car,&quot; Haddad said. &quot;But from a legal standpoint, there was nothing illegal about it. Morally, ethically? Yes, you could certainly question it. But legally? No.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mixing of moral and legal issues is one of the most prevailing -- and disconcerting -- aspects of the trial, said Bruce Reinhart, a former federal prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said white people are regularly prosecuted for shooting black people. The problem is no one other than Zimmerman knows what happened and he insisted he acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think you can say the justice system failed,&quot; he said. &quot;The jury did its job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions about racism and gun ownership are societal problems that the legal system isn't designed to answer. &quot;The legal part is over. Let's focus on the bigger problems. Let's have a productive dialogue on the bigger issues, such as, how do we raise our kids so they have more sensitivity?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, he said, while the legal system didn't punish Zimmerman, he is unlikely to return to the life he had before he killed Martin. Just as Casey Anthony was shunned after being acquitted of killing her daughter, Zimmerman will probably suffer the same fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman may not be legally guilty, but if society thinks he did wrong, it will treat him accordingly,&quot; Reinhart said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear whether the legal system is through with him. The federal government could pursue him for criminal civil rights violations, although most legal observers said they doubted such action would be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More likely, Martin's parents could pursue a civil lawsuit against him. West Palm Beach civil attorneys, including Jack Scarola and Ted Babbitt, said civil cases require only that a jury find that Zimmerman caused Martin's death by &quot;a preponderance of the evidence&quot; -- often described as 51 percent. If a jury believed that Martin was somewhat responsible, they could apportion some blame to him while still holding Zimmerman mostly responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, both said, is that it doesn't appear Zimmerman has any money. As is the American way, both acknowledged, he could get a lucrative book deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't see anybody seriously taking the case except for the publicity,&quot; Babbitt said, &quot;which would, of course, be enormous.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acquitting George Zimmerman required jurors to ignore crucial facts. Mr. Zimmerman was an armed adult. Trayvon Martin was an unarmed child. Mr. Zimmerman was spoiling for a confrontation. Mr. Martin was buying snacks. Police dispatchers advised Mr. Zimmerman to back off. Did Mr. Martin feel he was being stalked? Jurors never got to hear his version, because Mr. Zimmerman killed him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key to Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal apparently was the defense contention that he was in genuine fear for his life. Defense witnesses portrayed him as a softie who could not have held his own once embroiled in a fight. Ignore everything before Mr. Zimmerman got himself into that jam, and the not guilty verdict makes narrow sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it doesn't fit any satisfying definition of justice. The person who starts a fight should be legally culpable if that fight escalates to the point that the instigator has to use lethal force to save his own life. He shouldn't lose the right to defend himself; the other combatant should not be free to kill him with impunity. But the person who starts a fight is not innocent. Self-defense law should be clarified to allow manslaughter or its equivalent in cases like this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As disappointing as this trial's outcome is, it could have been worse. Citing Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, police initially did not arrest Mr. Zimmerman. But that blatant injustice did not stand. Protests led to national publicity, which led to the appointment of special prosecutor Angela Corey, who made the decision to charge Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder. Charging Mr. Zimmerman with that crime was the right call, as was Seminole County Circuit Judge Debra Nelson's decision last week to explicitly instruct jurors that they could consider the lesser charge of manslaughter. If the judge had not allowed that option, second-guessing after the acquittal would be even more intense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial issues hang over this case. Did Mr. Zimmerman profile a black teen wearing a hoodie? Did jurors unconsciously do the same, with defense attorneys subtly steering them in that direction? As we have noted, jurors could not form a direct impression because Mr. Martin could not take the stand. The NAACP has asked the U.S. Justice Department to prosecute Mr. Zimmerman for violating Mr. Martin's civil rights. The Justice Department said Sunday it is reviewing the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal prosecution following a state acquittal should be rare. But this case deserves serious federal scrutiny, particularly given lawmakers' unconcern that state laws are inciting amateurs to draw and use guns they're dangerously ill-prepared to use in a crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal centered on his right to defend his life. A federal case would focus on Mr. Martin's right to live his life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be a shame if the unnecessary death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin produced more paydays for the man who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager in the heart during a scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But George Zimmerman, the Sanford, Fla., neighborhood watch captain who has already received hundreds of thousands of dollars from gun-rights advocates and other supporters, is likely to be offered millions through lucrative book and movie deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges late Saturday night by a sequestered jury that had deliberated about 16 hours over two days. The five-week-trial had included more than 50 witnesses and 60 pieces of evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That a verdict was returned at night almost seemed by design to reduce the possibility of sparking protests that might turn violent. But heated arguments stemming from Martin's death at the hands of the white Hispanic defendant 17 months ago will likely continue for a long time. People remain bitterly divided not only by race, but their attitudes toward Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight-year-old law, which has been mimicked in more than 20 other states, is an abomination. It extends the so-called Castle Doctrine - which gives a person the legal right to use deadly force in his home - to anywhere, anytime. Zimmerman's lawyers contended that Florida's law, which does not require a person to use deadly force only as a last resort, gave their client the right to shoot Martin. They presented testimony suggesting that Zimmerman, though he outweighed Martin, was unable to protect himself otherwise in their fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given that the law was such a huge hurdle to overcome, the decision to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder is being criticized by other legal experts. Indeed, the prosecutors all but admitted failure to prove that charge when late in the trial they succeeded in getting the judge to instruct the all-female jury - five white women and one Hispanic - that they could also consider convicting Zimmerman of the lesser charge of manslaughter. But in the end, Stand Your Ground prevailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can only imagine how events might have turned out the night Martin was killed had it not been for this law that encourages people to shoot first and ask questions later. Zimmerman said he wasn't familiar with the Stand Your Ground law, but that was one of several lies he told, including trying to hide $135,000 he had raised for his defense online. The law was covered extensively in a criminal-justice course that he took in college when he was thinking of becoming a policeman. Were it not for knowing about the latitude that Stand Your Ground provided, would Zimmerman have been armed and on the streets looking for trouble?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is only a small chance that federal authorities will charge Zimmerman with violating Martin's civil rights. More likely, his next court date, if there is one, will be in a wrongful-death trial similar to the one that made sure O.J. Simpson didn't benefit financially after being exonerated in the death of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. Ironically, that trial, which also divided America by race, provided a black defendant and a white victim. Eighteen years later, people still disagree about the Simpson verdict, just as they disagree about Zimmerman's. But their arguments won't bring either victim back to life.    </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debate swirled Sunday over the not-guilty verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, as public officials and private citizens focused on racial profiling, self-defense, and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayor Nutter, who last year called the shooting &quot;an assassination,&quot; was among those who expressed disappointment in George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of Martin, 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A young black man is dead without any real explanation,&quot; Nutter said in a statement. &quot;George Zimmerman took an innocent life. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who at trial was made to appear threatening when all he had was a bag of Skittles and an iced tea, should not have died at Zimmerman's hands, and I believe the jury should have exacted a penalty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From government offices and church pulpits, to public plazas and river walks, people - many with strong emotions - weighed in on the jury verdict that was issued Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside the Municipal Services Building, the statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo, who had a poor relationship with Philadelphia's African American community, was a focal point Sunday for a vigil for Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This system is still racist,&quot; read a poster that was hung around the statue's neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Passers-by took pictures of the demonstration area and voiced their opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A young black kid was killed because he was black,&quot; said Aine Ni Shoinnaigh, 35, an Ireland native who immigrated to the United States five years ago. &quot;If Trayvon had been a young white kid in that suburb smoking a crack pipe, he probably would have been allowed to go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman's mother is Hispanic, and his father is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That man [Zimmerman] is going to have to live with that. He killed a child,&quot; said the Rev. Patricia Thomas, 61, associate pastor of Spirit and Truth Worship Cathedral in Strawberry Mansion. &quot;He got off legally, but morally he did not get away. We have a legal system that's broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It does seem like there's an underlying race issue,&quot; said Abby Blackmore, 28, a native of New Zealand who was visiting Philadelphia. &quot;It doesn't matter who killed who. [How people judge one another] should be color-blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Philadelphia, as in many cities throughout the nation Sunday, protests over the verdict remained largely peaceful, despite highly charged emotions. In some places, demonstrators burned American flags as President Obama - and the Martin family - urged nonviolence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Parry, a former federal and state prosecutor who practices law in Philadelphia, reviewed the case and said &quot;Zimmerman should have never been charged in the first place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Thanks to Zimmerman's tenacious lawyers, the prosecution was forced to release the evidence that established self-defense,&quot; Parry said. &quot;It's not that they botched the case. They brought a case they should have never brought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the White House, Obama referred to Martin's death as a &quot;tragedy&quot; and called for &quot;calm reflection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this,&quot; the president said. &quot;As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church in West Philadelphia, the sermon Sunday addressed the verdict indirectly, focusing on how God would want the congregation to react, and on the larger social ills that underlie the killing and its aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There's a lot of consternation,&quot; said Pastor Tokunbo Adelekan. &quot;People are deeply disappointed. Profoundly upset. . . . But also not surprised at the way things have gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Racism is in the air that we breathe,&quot; Adelekan said after the service. He hoped his members came away with &quot;a sense of reassurance and hope,&quot; instead of &quot;a sense of retributive justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jurors' work was summed up in two words by Isaiah Elum, 21 and black, of Northeast Philadelphia, who was on a walk near the Art Museum Sunday: &quot;No justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe something should've happened,&quot; said Elum, whose thoughts then went to Martin's parents. &quot;At the end of the day, they lost a son. He's not here to tell his story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protests carried into the evening, when about 500 people gathered at LOVE Park before marching around City Hall and down Market Street toward Independence Mall shouting, &quot;Boycott Florida!&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't even like guns, but what it says is I better buy one,&quot; Michael Wilson, 55, of Philadelphia Action Network, said of the verdict. &quot;You better get a gun and be prepared to use it, because the police won't protect you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeff Rousset, 27, a national organizer for Prometheus Radio Project, said the verdict &quot;continues a long legacy of white supremacy in the United States, and it continues to demonstrate the U.S. prison system is built on the bones of slavery to kill and incarcerate black and brown bodies, and never to protect them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearby, Mary Parlee, 27, visiting from Boston, thought she knew how the verdict should go - until she watched the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My initial thought was that George Zimmerman should have been locked behind bars for the rest of his life,&quot; Parlee said. She said she followed the case closely, and &quot;felt completely different after hearing the defense's arguments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm not sure he should have gotten off completely, but I can see why they came to that verdict,&quot; Parlee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nutter's expression of disappointment over the verdict came with a call for constructive action:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to resolve to make life better in America for all our children, regardless of skin color. Let us focus our anger and resolve to work toward a more just, safer and more caring America.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REGULAR READERS of this column know that Tattle is no fan of the &quot;faux reality&quot; TV empire built on the breasts and buttocks of Kim Kardashian and her whiny, overindulged family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no matter how much attention she craves, no one except her doctors should have access to her medical records. So it's encouraging that hospital-to-the-stars Cedars-Sinai has reportedly fired half-a-dozen employees, according to the Los Angeles Times, for hacking patient records, including those of North's mama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times reported that four of the canned hospital workers were employees of physicians with staff privileges, one was a hospital medical assistant and one was an unpaid student-research assistant.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really? Unpaid researchers have access to medical records? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five of the ex-Cedars employees accessed a single patient's record - wonder who - while one viewed 14 records, the Times reported. We sure hope those records weren't observed while the worker was supposed to be working - reminiscent of the SEC workers who watched porn while Wall Street burned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim K told TMZ.com that she had been contacted by the hospital about the breach (of security, not birth) and she was pleased that the hospital had taken prompt action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time this has happened at Cedars-Sinai, and the unfortunate fact of the matter is that if you're a celebrity in a hospital, some low-paid worker (with minimal ethics) may see your stay as a potential cash cow and you will get far too much attention. If you're a regular citizen, you won't get any attention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stars and Trayvon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At her Nashville concert Saturday, Beyonce called for a moment of silence for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin during her show at Bridgestone Arena. Her concert started about 30 minutes after the George Zimmerman not-guilty verdict began to circulate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to have a moment of silence for Trayvon,&quot; Bey said as the stage grew dark with just a few key lights shining. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce then sang the chorus of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; before transitioning into her hit &quot;Halo.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Facebook, Young Jeezy posted a new song, &quot;It's a Cold World (A Tribute to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin),&quot; with a comment: &quot;I am in no way shape, form, or fashion . . . trying to capitalize off of the latest series of events. These are my true feelings and my form of expression about it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell Simmons, a producer and entrepreneur, posted a blog entry that said that he'd be supporting the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Foundation in helping to repeal laws like Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law. He signed off, &quot;God bless you little brother. Rest in peace.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called for those upset with the verdict to channel their energy away from violence, telling followers that &quot;we must remain peaceful. No matter what, remain peaceful.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If u have any anger this evening,&quot; Simmons wrote on Twitter, &quot;put that energy into challenging these horrible laws that allow overly-anxious neighborhood watchmen to carry guns and shoot innocent people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Burgundy Berry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halle Berry has married for the third time and for the third time she hasn't married Tattle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, the groom is actor Olivier Martinez, and the pair wed Saturday in a village church in France's Burgundy region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owner of the Chateau de Vallery, where the couple stayed with their 60 guests, said yesterday that the betrothal Saturday ended with a dinner and an unusual fireworks display - of water, fire and snow - in the chateau gardens. A wedding cake followed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrice Vansteenberghe said that the actress - 46 and pregnant - and her 47-year-old husband &quot;were very beautiful and very happy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TATTBITS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has been outed as the author of The Cuckoo's Calling under her pseudonym Robert Galbraith. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hoped to keep this secret a little longer because being Robert Galbraith has been such a liberating experience,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation, and pure pleasure to get feedback from publishers and readers under a different name.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cuckoo's Calling, a story about a war veteran turned private investigator who is called in to probe the mysterious death of a model, was published to rave reviews in April. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday Times claimed it was investigating &quot;how a first-time author with a background in the army and the civilian security industry could write such an assured debut novel&quot; when it connected the dots. The paper said that clues included the fact that Rowling and Galbraith shared the same agent and editor, and that Little, Brown published Rowling's novel for adults, The Casual Vacancy. It also said that the book's style and subject matter resembled Rowling's work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rowling's publicist confirmed the paper's detective work, and the news helped the novel climb straight to the top of Amazon's best-seller list yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* 20th Century Fox has formed a new joint venture to turn the studio's library of films into musicals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like &quot;Avatar&quot;? &quot;Die Hard&quot;? &quot;Star Wars&quot;? Or that incredible one-man-and-a-singing-beach-ball musical, &quot;Cast Away&quot;? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what rhymes with &quot;Wolverine&quot;? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forgotten in this move is that Broadway, before it became overwhelmed by shows based on movies, used to create original musicals. And 20th Century Fox made musicals: &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (Rex Harrison version), &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; the Marilyn Monroe/Jane Russell starrer &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,&quot; Ethel Merman in &quot;There's No Business Like Show Business,&quot; the great Bob Fosse movie &quot;All That Jazz,&quot; and more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the Nicholas Brothers' best work in film was done at Fox. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, come on, Fox. We don't need &quot;Ice Age: The Musical.&quot; Come up with something new. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HUNDREDS OF peaceful protesters marched around City Hall yesterday to voice their disappointment and call for justice for slain Florida teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin the day after George Zimmerman was acquitted in Martin's shooting death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Center City gathering was one of several across the country in the hours following the controversial verdict. It also punctuated a day marked by reflection on the case, which reignited the national debate about racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was terrified. The first thing I did [after hearing the verdict] was kiss my kids,&quot; Northeast Philadelphia resident Alaya Burnett, 33, a mother of two sons, said in LOVE Park. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowd of mostly black protesters ranged from toddlers to the elderly. Many held signs and expressed frustration, if not shock, at the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Antoinette Cottman, 46, was blunt about the dangers facing her son, who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I realize my son is a target,&quot; said Cottman, a Germantown resident. She said that her son, Dante, 25, has been arrested twice for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or fitting the description of someone wanted by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cottman was joined at the protest by her niece, Lateshia Burris, 35, and Burris' son, Kanard. A soft-spoken, skinny 14-year-old, Kanard bears a striking resemblance to Martin, except that Kanard has a dyed-blond streak in his hair. After hearing the verdict, he said he would think twice before going to certain areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If it's a busy neighborhood that is unfamiliar, I'll hold back,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Near the back of the crowd stood Paige Bordthauser, 31, a teacher on a business trip from Charlottesville, Va. When trying to describe her reaction to the verdict, she immediately teared up and took a moment before speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was really surprised and disappointed,&quot; said Bordthauser, who is white. &quot;My fiance is black and we plan to start a family. That could have been him. If we had a son, that could have been it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Bright Hope Baptist Church in North Philadelphia, Senior Pastor Kevin R. Johnson's sermon invoked the memory of the late William Gray III, the former congressman and Bright Hope pastor. Gray, who died July 1, was memorialized at the church on Saturday, but Johnson also weaved in references to the verdict, calling it a reminder of how far America has to go to get past the effects of Jim Crow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also chided Florida State Attorney Angela Corey for appearing &quot;relieved&quot; in a post-verdict interview, adding that she would not have reacted that way if it were her child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That's the problem, it's never been their child,&quot; Johnson shouted from the pulpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson said that after the verdict, his 12-year-old son said to his wife and him: &quot;I don't understand. He was just a boy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And for me, how do you help your child understand that it's a crime to be walking while black?&quot; Johnson asked after the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several local elected officials also weighed in on the issue, with Mayor Nutter saying he was &quot;deeply saddened&quot; and strongly disagreed with the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A young black man is dead without any real explanation,&quot; Nutter said in a statement. &quot;George Zimmerman took an innocent life. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who at trial was made to appear threatening when all he had was a bag of Skittles and an iced tea, should not have died at Zimmerman's hands, and I believe the jury should have exacted a penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged residents to remain calm and work toward preventing similar tragedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to resolve to make life better in America for all our children, regardless of skin color. Let us focus our anger and resolve to work toward a more just, safer and more caring America,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philadelphia state Sen. Vincent Hughes took to Twitter on Saturday to voice his displeasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Heart's broken about the verdict,&quot; Hughes tweeted. &quot;But we must maintain our focus &amp; lift up the lives of our sons &amp; clear the path 2 the future they deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;God bless Trayvon. God bless the Martin family,&quot; Hughes said in another tweet. &quot;Be cool, folks and honor them with our prayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Justice Department said yesterday that its investigation is &quot;ongoing.&quot; A spokesman said the department will consider evidence gathered during the federal probe, as well as evidence and testimony from the state trial, to determine if it &quot;reveals a prosecutable violation&quot; of civil-rights statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many compared the case to landmark trials during the civil-rights movement, including the deaths of civil-rights activist Medgar Evers and Emmett Till, the 14-year-old whose murder in Mississippi in 1955 helped ignite the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The signal and precedent that it sends is a tad bit frightening,&quot; City Councilman Curtis Jones said of the verdict. &quot;I understand the principle of 'stand your ground,' but if you take it literally it means stand, don't go pursuing people where you're almost looking for trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philly state Sen. Anthony Hardy Williams Jr. said the Martin family's response and peaceful protests reflected &quot;a generation that wants to release its reaction in a constructive way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We'll see if this case is what vaults us forward similar to Emmett Till,&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DON WEST, the defense attorney for George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin case, used to be a DJ at WMMR. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former 'MMR DJ Michael Tearson said West worked for the station between 1977 and 1978, during the second tenure of legendary program director Jerry Stevens. &quot;He was there for basically a long sip of water,&quot; Tearson said about West's short stint. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other 'MMR employees who worked at the station around the same time could not place West.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although he appears to have a made-for-radio name, not even the longest tenured employees recall his time at 'MMR,&quot; said program director Bill Weston. &quot;Was it pre-'68 during our Sinatra years?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West received a bachelor's degree and a master's of education from Penn, according to his LinkedIn profile, and has a history in radio, working at Los Angeles' KROQ before his &quot;not very long and not very successful&quot; (according to Tearson) WMMR shift. He then moved up to Toronto's CHUM-FM. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West made waves during his opening statement when he told a joke: &quot;Knock, knock. Who's there? George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman who? Congratulations, you're on the jury.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, I didn't think it was very funny, either. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Imus returns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Imus is back on Philly's radio dial after a six-year absence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outspoken radio DJ returned to the local airwaves this morning, taking the 6 to 9 a.m. on IQ 106.9 FM. Previously occupying the morning-drive spot was &quot;Philly Morning News,&quot; hosted at one point by Larry Mendte and Al Gardner until Mendte was fired in December, with Gardner getting the ax in March. Recently, the show was hosted by Lionel and Michelle Murillo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imus hasn't been on the air in Philly since 2007 when he was fired from CBS for making racially insensitive comments about the Rutgers' women's basketball team. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent Arbitron ratings show IQ 106.9 FM tied with similarly formatted talk-radio station 1210 WPHT, with each taking a 2.1 market in the most recent data. The previous two months of data show IQ 106.9 with a lead over WPHT, however. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Monteith's final Philly moment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cory Monteith, the &quot;Glee&quot; star who was found dead in his Vancouver hotel room on Saturday, filmed what will now be one of his final roles in Philadelphia last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;McCanick,&quot; directed by Josh C. Waller, starred Chestnut Hill's David Morse and Warminster native Mike Vogel. Morse plays Eugene &quot;Mack&quot; McCanick, a detective who, along with his partner (Vogel), hunts a criminal recently released from prison (Monteith). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greater Philadelphia Film Office chief Sharon Pinkenson referred to &quot;McCanick&quot; as a &quot;microbudget&quot; film and a labor of love for all involved when it was shooting in Philly. The film does not yet have a release date. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monteith was interviewed on WMMR's &quot;Preston and Steve&quot; show hours after filming wrapped. The show's Twitter account wrote yesterday that he was &quot;such a nice guy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6ABC in the park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you were around LOVE Park on Thursday, you might have caught the 6ABC morning team, including Matt O'Donnell, Tamala Edwards, David Murphy and Karen Rogers, shooting a promo for the station. Five hundred people applied through Facebook to talk with the morning team and write on a big board what 6ABC meant to them. About 150 people chosen showed up despite the not-so-nice weather. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fun fact: O'Donnell wears two friendship bracelets on his wrist made by his daughter. So cah-yoot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Big' night</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our own &quot;Big&quot; Reuben Harley will put on his chef's whites tomorrow night at classy pizza-centric joint Zavino as a guest chef. Rube will be serving ground turkey lasagna, pesto linguine with broiled chicken, seasonal salad with Dijon vinaigrette, caramelized onion goat cheese with beef bacon and a &quot;Sumthin' sexy cocktail,&quot; featuring Malibu Bay Breeze with Patron and peach Schnapps </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">725 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They united and spoke, sang and chanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They clapped and yelled, cried and grieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, they sat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two diverse rallies in Pittsburgh on Sunday merged at the Hill Distict's Freedom Corner to speak out against the not guilty verdict issued Saturday night in George Zimmerman's trial -- culminating with a sit-in that blocked Centre Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A first group of about 120 people spoke out in Mellon Park around 3 p.m.; many then moved to Crawford Street and Centre at 6 p.m. to continue the discussion with about 200 of their peers, despite the sweltering heat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by 6:32, about a dozen people, mostly women, moved from the gathering to sit in the middle lane of the roadway between the Freedom Corner monument and St. Benedict the Moor Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The women always lead the movement,&quot; a woman screamed from the curb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another woman, who was sitting, yelled to the crowd standing, &quot;How long are you going to listen to people talk?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Red-eyed, with tears streaming down their faces, two young black women tightly gripped each other's hand as they sat cross-legged on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not doing this for me. I am doing this for my sister and brother. ... We shouldn't have to wait for the next thing. You can't plan for this. The next thing could happen tonight,&quot; said Bria Thomas, 20, of Observatory Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to feel like this is my country, too. It's not. The system was never built for us,&quot; said Brya Adams, 19, of Manchester. &quot;We matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another woman said she couldn't leave her friends' sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kind of racism leads to people not feeling like they're people,&quot; said Helen Gerhardt, a 46-year-old white woman from East Liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After two orders to disperse, 12 remained sitting: six black women, four white women and two white men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police cars blocked Centre Avenue from Crawford to Vine Street, and officers stood uphill, stacks of zip-tie handcuffs in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group discussed the benefits and downfalls of civil disobedience and whether being arrested could affect change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're just enslaving our bodies,&quot; a woman said, advising the group that they couldn't make positive change from inside a jail cell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we get up, we're submitting, too. It's lose-lose,&quot; a seated woman retorted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel you. It's modern day slavery,&quot; the first woman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the duty commander and commander of the city's North Side police station, RaShall Brackney, arrived, she kneeled in front of those sitting and told them they could continue their protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she would leave a police car at each end of the block, return the other units back into service, and the group was welcome to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would love that we sit here and talk about it and come up with a plan, a sustainable plan,&quot; she told them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the black women sitting told the commander, &quot;Sister, I know you, I took hip-hop aerobics with you. But, sister, my question is can you really expect us to put our trust in the police? We can't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man told those sitting that the chance of having Cmdr. Brackney on call showed that &quot;God is on our side,&quot; telling them that if she wanted to have them moved or arrested, they would have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to do things peacefully,&quot; Cmdr. Brackney, still kneeling, told the group. &quot;We're going to do things sustainably -- that means not just for the moment, not just because it's emotional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here's what I want from all our young ladies, and here's what I'm going to suggest: Every time we have a homicide in our communities that's committed by one of us, that we go to that same place and we sit there. That we hold that community accountable, the same way that we want to hold Seminole, Fla., accountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This course of action, the commander later said, was to &quot;not [give] any additional fuel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic was diverted around the block, and the group wasn't causing a major disturbance or endangering other citizens, she said. The commander, who was on duty until 8 this morning, said she would monitor the sit-in through the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The young people need a way to express their confusion about the verdict,&quot; said Cmdr. Brackney, who offered to attend a gathering to discuss sustainable plans for the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brandi Fisher, president and CEO of the Alliance for Police Accountability, said she hadn't expected the rallies to end with a sit-in. She said she was proud of and respected those sitting for what they believed in, and she was proud of the police response.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--George Zimmerman's acquittal produced mixed reactions from Monroe County residents Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman supporters were somewhat muted in their response while those who believed that the community watch member murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were in disbelief and expressed a lack of confidence in the justice system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody from my congregation in New York to my friends in California, this hit us like a tsunami wave. It hit everybody,&quot; Tonyeaka Grant of Saylorsburg said. &quot;My friends were in tears. Some of them couldn't even breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Counterman of Price Township said he was surprised by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He really should have gotten second-degree murder. That's as prejudiced as prejudice gets,&quot; Counterman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant said she may have supported some kind of lower-level conviction against Zimmerman given the uncertainty about the fight between the two men, but she couldn't stand for him walking free after killing an unarmed Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't have cared if he would have gotten hit with jail time for two years. Put him in there for something. He had a loaded weapon. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had nothing,&quot; Grant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cheryl Wilson of Canadensis said the case was the latest example of racial prejudice affecting the criminal justice system, and that the evidence proved Zimmerman was guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police told Zimmerman not to pursue Trayvon. Based on that alone, Zimmerman broke the law. He disobeyed the police and pursued Trayvon anyway, even though he was not a threat to him,&quot; Wilson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Hudson of Tannersville said Martin posed no real threat to Zimmerman, so the self-defense story is irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think the use of deadly force might be appropriate. But in reality, it's never appropriate because it's not like his life was being threatened,&quot; Hudson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanda Lasher of Stroudsburg said watching the case on TV actually convinced her that Zimmerman could be found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Following the case changed my perspective. Initially, I was on the borderline, but as the evidence was brought forward, I figured the acquittal was there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marcy Schock of Bangor said she wasn't very passionate one way or the other, but felt that Florida prosecutors could have made a better case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think one of the reasons it came out the way it was was that the prosecution could have done better,&quot; Schock said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindsey Jones of Stroudsburg compared the case to another Florida incident, in which a woman named Marissa Alexander was convicted despite using the same &quot;stand your ground&quot; defense Zimmerman did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Florida needs to get their act together. It's not even,&quot; Jones said. &quot;They need to have consistency.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember all those people who made you scoff when they saidthe Trayvon Martin case wasn't about race? They were right, even if they didn't really understand why. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its root, Martin's case wasn't about race. Never was. His skin pigmentation was an enabling symptom, not the illness itself. The sad fact is that confining such cases to race obscures the scope of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's about being Different. Which, sure, frequently includes race, but also transcends it in equally significant if somewhat less obvious ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another shooter might object to long hair, Lennon glasses and an Occupy Wall Street t-shirt. Another shooter might object to a woman protesting laws that target her uterus. Another shooter might object to pale youth in sad-clown goth makeup and black clothes. Another shooter might object to gay men holding hands in the park. And, yes, any one of those objectionable people might themselves object to anyone who meets their own concept of the Different, and therefore threatening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals harbor different ideas about what is Different, and therefore objectionable, and - given the right sequence of escalating events - life-threatening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It becomes an especially acute risk when we're talking about communities like Sanford, Fla. or Chambersburg, Pa., where particular ideologies and demographics dominate and apparent or merely suspected fish out of water really stand out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real legacy of the Martin case is thatStand Your Ground laws enable a circumstantial, conditional open season on the Different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some might chalk our fear of the Different up to base human nature, a fundamental condition that no law can even address, let alone prevent. They'd probably be right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we certainly can avoid and reject laws purpose-built to inject reasonable doubt into every step of a lethal-force encounter. Variants of such laws exist in half the nation's states, including Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken in isolation, no one wins the Martin case. If there is an opportunity for anything positive to arise therefrom, it rests not within legislatures but within each and every one of us. It depends on our willingness to confront our fear, to honestly assess its source, to determine how to short-circuit the spark that takes us from Different to Deadly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a difference between defending against clear and present danger, and lower-brain discomfort with the Different that drives us to it. We must find that line within ourselves. That is a large part of the difference between a reasonable human being and an unfeeling sociopath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a bonus, such self-awareness would make variants on Stand Your Ground laws wholly unnecessary, and therefore ripe for repeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--Late Saturday night the country found out neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a Florida community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 17-year-old Martin was an unarmed black teenager who had just gone to the store to buy iced tea and a pack of Skittles, and was heading home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances of the killing, the trial and the verdict set off heated debates about racial profiling and self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the Rev. Margaret Redmond gave a highly passionate and animated sermon to a congregation of about 30 people at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church about the incident and the verdict reached on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon was a 3.0 student who mentored young children in his community. He didn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from page 1A ________________________ belong to a gang, he didn't sell drugs and he wasn't even packing no heat,&quot; Redmond said. &quot;Yet he found himself on the wrong end of a gun of a man that feared him so much that he felt obliged not to let him get away with going to the store for some candy and iced tea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redmond preached in frustration, often times yelling her sermon to the congregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh God, I'm angry. I want to know when we will see justice!&quot; she said emphatically. &quot;I want to know, when do the black and brown bodies stop being strange fruit for a picnic? I'm hurting. My son could be Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He was doing nothing but being a kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redmond said all that really matters in the case is that a 17-year-old kid was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't care who you were rooting for, Zimmerman or Trayvon, the fact of the matter is Trayvon is still dead and George Zimmerman still killed him,&quot; she said. &quot;The law says Zimmerman is not a murderer but his actions say he is a killer. I don't know what kind of theology he has but I do know that Zimmerman is going to have to live with that thought for the rest of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redmond told the congregation that what happened to Martin could've happened for a reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps God has taken Trayvon to a better place, a place where there is no profiling, a place where nobody will look at him and think he's just an angry black man,&quot; she said. &quot;Just maybe, God is using Trayvon as our Emmett Till to get us up and do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On most Sundays, the steps of the John Marshall Courthouse in downtown Richmond are deserted. But the Sunday after the Saturday that a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was no ordinary Sunday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While court was not in session, more than 250 people convened a civil court of public opinion on the north steps of the dark-bricked hall of justice -- unified by the feeling that the system had failed the 17-year-old victim and searching for a way to channel anger, fear and despair into change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A system can't fail those it was designed to protect,&quot; read one of the many handmade signs scattered among the diverse crowd of black and white, young and old, who assembled at sunset to hear preachers, activists and elected officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground against racism,&quot; read another sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richmond activist James J.J. Minor, 38, told the gathering to have faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice will be served,&quot; he said. &quot;It may be on layaway, but it will be served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Rev. Uzziah Harris, 37, offered a prayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're praying for healing now,&quot; he said. &quot;Even when man does wrong, God will have the final say-so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders urged their followers to view the verdict as a call to action, more than an opportunity to vent outrage over a decision that can't be undone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict has been rendered, now the work begins,&quot; read a statement issued by the Richmond NAACP's president, Kim Allen. She urged supporters to organize to fight laws like Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that have what Allen termed &quot;loopholes for injustice, racial profiling and other acts of discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our responsibility to take the actions necessary to protect the rights and lives of ourselves, our families and our communities,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Del. Delores L. McQuinn, D-Richmond, was still dressed in her Sunday best when she addressed the crowd. She said she went to bed angry Saturday night, and woke up angry Sunday morning before she went to church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I look ... I see Trayvon in many faces of these African-American men,&quot; she said, reflecting on her anger and the &quot;senseless murder&quot; of the teen armed only with a pack of Skittles in his pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do we do?&quot; she asked rhetorically, before offering an impassioned plea for action so that in her mind, this latest rally, this latest eulogy for a life cut short, wouldn't end when everyone went home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vote, McQuinn said. Become involved in the classroom, mentor someone. Start making a difference, one person at a time in your community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get mad -- get mad as hell,&quot; McQuinn said. &quot;But after you get mad, get up and do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting her own emotions, she added: &quot;Love is always stronger than hate. Always.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally ended with a march around the deserted courthouse building. But those in attendance seemed determined to seek change. Some saw it as a matter of life and death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Gresham listened as she held her daughter, Arielle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're not going to take my baby,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still stung by the verdict of not guilty, I am disgusted to read comments in the article in the paper on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a proven liar, who was 100 pounds heavier than Trayvon&nbsp;Martin that night and now fattened up to look unfit and no threat to a skinny 17-year-old, decided to take a gun, hunt a boy he assumed was no good and then kill him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Trayvon had beat the life out of him, he would have deserved it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He started it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman and his lawyers went on right-wing radio shows and Zimmerman was asked by one host if he had any regrets. He replied &quot;No&quot; and added: &quot;It was God's will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then we read the quote in your story on Sunday where a white brother and sister in their 50s called the case &quot;a tragedy,&quot; especially for Zimmerman. &quot;It's a tragedy that he is going to suffer for the rest of his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you kidding me?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least he has a life and with the likely NRA speaking tour, endorsements and since it is Florida, his long-awaited job with a police department, he and his lawyers will be just fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travesty of justice doesn't even come close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Bee Simpson, South Pasadena</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headline on Zimmerman verdict was inflammatory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your July 14 headline &quot;Zimmerman walks&quot; is highly inflammatory, and incites the very thing that communities are attempting to avoid. Local law enforcement is on tactical alert, and praying that people will remain calm during this time. And then along comes your headline to add fuel to the fire. This type of tabloid reporting is designed to sell papers without regard for any possible negative repercussions that may be brought about. Your newspaper would serve the community better by keeping your editorial views out of the front-page headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Rob Daltorio, Jr., Monterey Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First name for Trayvon, last name for Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a brave jury that came down with the verdict that they did. With the media leaning in favor of Martin, it should have gone in the other direction, but it did not. And this is a terrific surprise for the Martin supporters: they are very unhappy with the verdict, to say the least. And further legal action is implied. Ever since the Martin and Zimmerman became the topic of the media, especially with the radio talk shows, more often than not, when the subjects of this case were mentioned, it was on a first name basis for Trayvor Martin and always on the last name basis for George Zimmerman. This name game certainly favored Martin. Even their physical descriptions, when described, favored Martin: &quot;the thin 17-year-old youth ... against a much older, heavier opponent&quot; is how one newscaster described the fatal confrontation, and was echoed through the airwaves by popular talk show hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word &quot;opponent&quot; automatically put Zimmerman in the losers' corner. And this is not an isolated case, especially now that Zimmerman is a free person. With such rhetoric in abundance, it is maybe just a matter of time before a movie is made about this famous case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Tony Farinella, El Monte</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if the shooter instead had been black?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, on the night of July 13, 2013, an unarmed teenager, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, shot to death in February, 2012, was put on trial while the shooter, George Zimmerman, was set free. Even though the defense team and prosecutors seem to be OK with the not-guilty verdict, both sides constantly stating that &quot;it's not about race,&quot; the world watched and made the correct judgment. The questio remains: What if the shooter had been black? -- Sharlene White, Oceanside</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peaceful protests this weekend in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal should not dissolve into complacency. They should inspire renewed activism to change gun laws and societal attitudes so that armed confrontations are not encouraged, as they are today in places like Florida, and so that people who end up shooting and killing unarmed individuals have some responsibility if their own actions brought on the confrontation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We say peaceful protests because the violence and destruction committed by small numbers of protesters -- vandals, really -- in Oakland and other cities have no political legitimacy. Anger over Trayvon Martin's death is understandable, but the impulse to destroy property and attack blameless individuals is never justified. The peaceful marchers and the millions more Americans who had visceral reactions to this case are the ones capable of productive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are, consciously or not, on common ground with Gabby Giffords and others fighting for sensible gun laws and sensible attitudes toward gun violence. The toll it takes nationwide, with murder rates rising after decades of decline, makes it a major public health threat of our day. Its victims disproportionately are young men of color -- often dying at the hands of others of the same race. While the Martin case aroused outrage because it began as racial profiling, the other deaths too often are shrugged off. That is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's gun changed the dynamic on that fateful night. Calling 911 to report the suspicious character -- Martin was walking at night while black and wearing a hoodie -- Zimmerman was told not to pursue him. Surely he would have heeded that instruction had he not felt the invincibility of carrying a firearm in a state that glorifies the right to kill rather than avoid a fight. This is the societal effect of stand-your-ground laws passed by Florida and some 20 other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was upset at being followed. He may well have jumped Zimmerman in a fit of stupid male teenage machismo. But if Zimmerman had done what he'd been told to do, no one would have been hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case has to reinforce the fears of black families. They need to teach their children not only to obey the law but also how to behave so as not to raise suspicions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if a black man in a hoodie had decided a white teenager walking in his neighborhood looked suspicious? What if police told him not to follow the kid but he did anyway? And what if, when the white kid attacked him, he pulled a gun and shot him -- really, does anyone think that black man would not have been immediately arrested? Wouldn't police have looked at why he stalked the kid in the first place? Didn't the teenager have reason to be afraid?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin will leave a legacy if this trial inspires more Americans to look critically at our gun laws and the behavior they encourage. Behavior like that of George Zimmerman. Criminal or not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An odd case for Oakland to focus on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As shocking as George Zimmerman's acquittal may seem to most of us, let's keep in mind that there are so many murder victims whose killers slip through the cracks of the justice system or are simply never brought to justice. I find it more shocking that Oakland residents would protest Zimmerman's acquittal when the city of Oakland itself has had close to 50 homicides in just this year alone, which already surpasses last year's homicide total and includes a former student of mine, Aya Nakano, who was murdered in a senseless manner last month and whose killers have yet to be found. It seems that the national media has an odd way of selecting stories to cover and Oakland residents will wreak havoc on their own city based on something that happened 3,000 miles away. Think about murder victims in your own city and let's be more sensible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida law is ridiculous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the recent acquittal of teen-killer George Zimmerman, if he actually stayed in his car and waited for police to arrive as the dispatcher told him, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would be alive today. It's as simple as that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we really supposed to blame Trayvon for attacking Zimmerman, a complete stranger, who approached him while carrying a loaded weapon? Do we want to teach our kids to listen and obey random people who come up to you in the middle of the night?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I blame Zimmerman for the killing, ultimately, I blame the ridiculous Florida laws for his acquittal. The whole situation is tragic, from the killing to the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right to protect one's own life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman was right on the money. Those who object to his killing of an unarmed individual need to consider how many times police do the exact same thing and are never held responsible. A good example was in Oakland about a year and a half ago when an officer shot and killed a fleeing robbery suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect in no way threatened the officer. Although believed to be armed, it was later determined that he was not. Yet there was no action or charges against the officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theory that when a member of law enforcement for whatever reason &quot;feels threatened&quot; has the right to use deadly force but an ordinary citizen does not, conflicts with the principle of equal protection as guaranteed by the Constitution. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's actions were suspicious, and Zimmerman absolutely had the right to protect his life as much as anybody else.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paper goes overboard in bashing Chavez</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there no end to the Mercury News unremitting animosity toward Cindy Chavez? From its hostility toward her labor background to its ridiculous assertion in a recent editorial that her opponent is by far the better candidate, this paper has worked overtime to hammer Chavez. While Teresa Alvarado is fluffed as a fresh face who will engage from day one, Chavez is relentlessly attacked as a union crony with a shady side. Now she cozies up to Republicans, just like the Republican-endorsed Alvarado (Internal Affairs, July 14). What baloney. The problem for Chavez is that, unlike her opponent, she actually has a long and proven track record fighting for working people. Alvarado is as yet an empty vessel, easily filled with any number of civic fantasies. Cindy Chavez is someone unafraid to go to the mat for what she believes in and willing to endure the brickbats along the way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to know what exactly the U.S. Senate hopes to accomplish through its immigration &quot;points plan&quot; (Page 1A, July 14). The bill calls for annual green card awards not exceeding 250,000, even though more than a million were issued in 2012, according to the Office of Immigration Statistics for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Of these million, only 14 percent were chosen by employment factors, versus 66 percent through family ties. Drastically cutting the number of green cards and favoring the skilled and highly-educated is not only discriminatory, but encourages illegal residency, providing no incentive for the estimated 11 million illegal resident aliens in the U.S. to seek legitimacy. Furthermore, it discourages future immigrants from entering the country legally, especially if they are from developing nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Senate thinks limiting green cards to highly-skilled workers will generate economic capital, perhaps they should consider the national expense of supporting 11.5 million people and fix that problem first.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice failed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin the night he was killed. We should be appalled and outraged, but perhaps not surprised, that it failed him again Saturday night with a verdict setting his killer free. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal was set in motion Feb. 26, 2012, before Martin's body was cold. When Sanford, Fla., police arrived on the scene, they encountered a grown man who acknowledged killing an unarmed 17-year-old boy. They did not arrest him or test for drug or alcohol use. They conducted a less-than-energetic search for forensic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a national outcry forced authorities to investigate the killing seriously. Even after six weeks, evidence was found to justify arresting Zimmerman, charging him with second-degree murder. But the chance of dispassionately and definitively establishing what happened that night was probably lost. The only complete narrative was Zimmerman's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors knew that Zimmerman was an overeager would-be cop with a loaded gun. They were told that he profiled Martin -- young, black, hooded sweatshirt -- as a criminal. They heard that he stalked Martin despite the advice of a 911 operator; that the stalking led to a confrontation; and that, in the confrontation, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me, and to many who watched the trial, that Zimmerman recklessly initiated the tragic encounter was enough to establish, at a minimum, guilt of manslaughter. The six women on the jury disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jurors also knew that Martin, at the time of his death, was just three weeks past his 17th birthday. But black boys in this country are not allowed to be children. They are assumed to be men, and to be full of menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know if the jury, which included no African-Americans, consciously or unconsciously bought into this racist way of thinking -- there's really no other word. But it hardly matters, because police and prosecutors initially did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption underlying their ho-hum approach to the case was that Zimmerman had the right to self-defense but Martin -- young, male, black -- did not. The assumption was that Zimmerman would fear for his life in a hand-to-hand struggle but Martin -- young, male, black -- would not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anyone wonders why African-Americans feel so passionately about this case, it's because we know that our 17-year-old sons are boys, not men. We know how frightened our sons would be, walking home alone on a rainy night and realizing they were being followed. We know how they would struggle to decide the right course of action, flight or fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we know that a skinny boy armed only with candy does not pose a mortal threat to a healthy adult man who outweighs him by 50 pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation we must have is about how black men, even black boys, are denied the right to be young, to be vulnerable, to make mistakes. We need to talk about why, for example, black men are no more likely than white men to smoke marijuana but nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was fighting more than George Zimmerman that night. He was up against prejudices as old as American history, and he never had a chance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right-wing noise machine, as exemplified by sanctimonious con artists on radio talk shows, should amaze all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common sense says that if the deaths of four Americans in an attack on our embassy in Benghazi was &quot;all Obama's fault,&quot; then the violent deaths of more than 250 Americans at our embassy in Beirut in 1983 clearly must have been &quot;all Reagan's fault.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Same with the uproar about the Obama administration unlawfully and without warrants, tapping into the phone conversations of American citizens. What a horrible crime! As I remember, President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were doing the exact same thing for more than six years. Even Cheney stated recently that he saw &quot;nothing wrong&quot; with President Obama's actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The true definition of hypocrite: someone who loudly complains about the wrongful actions of Democrats yet remains purposely silent when Republican politicians do the same thing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Socialism ends when there's no more taxpayer money left for the government to give to the non-producing consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are fortunate right now because there's lots of production from American companies and our farmers, in addition to imports. When we combine this with all the government payments -- food stamps, welfare, government programs, gigantic government salaries, benefits and pensions -- our retail sector is doing very well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People will spend all the money they receive. Great! We have a wonderful economy as long as we can collect taxes and print money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will our great economy last forever? Maybe, maybe not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Obama administration's heavy attack on our family farms with taxes, permits, regulations and the death tax, we may come to a similar point that destroyed the Roman Empire 1,700 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That empire was so strong for 400 years because it had plenty of food. Farmers were prosperous because they sold their food to the economy. When taxes and regulations became so tenuous, the family farms finally reached a boiling point and stopped producing food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It happened 1,700 years ago and it will happen again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not understand why the Florida law allowing a person to kill someone when they feel threatened does not apply to Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager was walking down the street with a bag of Skittles and ice tea when George Zimmerman, who was more fit then, got out of his truck, contrary to directions from a 911 operator, with a gun. The next thing you know, the teenager is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why hasn't Zimmerman been locked up in jail from the beginning? Is this a case of racism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And was it racism or just plain hateful ignorance that was behind defense attorney Don West's daughter's posting a photo on Instagram with the caption: &quot;We beat stupidity celebration cones?&quot; As if the tasteless knock-knock joke wasn't bad enough!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could West and his family be any more insensitive to people with learning disabilities or born in different situations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My heart goes out to Rachel Jeantel. It is certainly understandable why she lied in an attempt not to get involved and be thrown to the mercy of a well-educated, slick attorney who apparently has no moral fiber.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I have nothing against unions (and actually am now a member of one), I don't understand why BART is even allowed to go on strike. Other cities, such as New York, do not allow their public transit to strike, and for good reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do we? This is costly for everyone, and very difficult for commuters. BART and its employees can bargain without making it difficult for the public, and as far as I can see, BART employees are pretty well off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think most of us would call them greedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News that California's per-capita creation of wastes has decreased from 4.4 pounds per person per day to 4.3 pounds (June 30) in the last year masks that the population has increased by 300,000 people, so the volume of wasted materials may stay about the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State staff erroneously (in my opinion) switched to a per-capita system of measurement about six years ago that fails to show serious progress in waste reduction during a depressed economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more interesting is the behavior of some businesses and families that make ounces of waste a day through careful purchasing and careful management of their used materials. Eight of the 10 largest cities in California have established zero waste goals, but the numbers don't show much progress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first tragedy of the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case is that it was a case at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman had done as police instructed, there probably would have been no media circus and we would never have heard of either man. More important, the teenager would still be alive and Zimmerman would not have been charged with second-degree murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, Zimmerman, an armed neighborhood watch volunteer in a Florida gated community, did not stay in his vehicle and, for whatever reason, chose to engage the African-American teen whom he had been following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That decision led to the tragic confrontation that left a young man dead from a gunshot to the chest, two families devastated, Zimmerman's life changed forever and spawned the latest gavel-to-gavel orgy of television courtroom drama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman's acquittal Saturday obviously relieved his family and friends, it also caused deep anguish for Martin's family and supporters, and has reinforced the notion of a racially biased legal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most who closely followed the case were not surprised by the acquittal. This is a state that has a so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that allows ordinary, nonpolice individuals to respond with lethal force when they are violently attacked. While it was not invoked in this trial, it does reflect a certain mindset about how Florida regards self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, there was some sort of an attack in this case, but the problem was establishing the aggressor. The prosecution alleged that it was Zimmerman who attacked Martin, while the defense claimed that it was actually the teen who attacked Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matters were further muddied during the trial when each man's mother separately took to the witness stand and unequivocally identified the screaming heard on a rough audio tape as that of her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, there was too much uncertainty about what really happened that night for a six-woman jury to be certain beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman was the aggressor. The jury had telegraphed its thinking when it asked the judge for reinstruction on the legal elements of manslaughter, a lesser charge than second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a challenging case from the beginning, although there were those who tried to pretend otherwise. To many in the nation who have suffered the crippling arrows of discrimination, this case reminded of a national history dotted with bigotry and a double standard of justice. This acquittal will only deepen those feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, we feel that the legitimate issues in this case have tended more toward the hyperbolic and political than the philosophical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been protests about the verdict and some -- including in Oakland -- have turned violent. Protesting is fine, but violence is unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extrajudicial portions of this case were rife with racial overtones. Once again we are reminded of the need for an honest -- and nonviolent -- national conversation about race and the American justice system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's set aside the issue of race for just a moment in the Trayvon Martin case. Strip away the hyperbole on the left and the right and cut to the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is what the not-guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial tells us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the state of Florida, a grown man can stalk a teenage boy whom he thinks &quot;is up to no good&quot; in his gated community. He can disobey a police dispatcher who tells him not to follow the 17-year-old. When the teen, who happens to be visiting the man's neighbor, gets upset that some stranger is following him and the two wind up in a brawl, the man can pull out a concealed gun and shoot him dead. Then he can claim self-defense even though he was the one who provoked the confrontation. Walk away scot free with the law on his side. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a jury of six women found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. A number of legal experts -- among them civil rights attorney John Burris -- have said the prosecution failed to make its case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A legal finding of not guilty, however, does not absolve Zimmerman of the fact that he took the life of a teen who was simply returning from the store with a box of Skittles. A teen who would be alive today if the neighborhood watch member and wanna-be-cop had not initiated a confrontation, then escalated it by pulling a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic circumstances of Martin's killing just three weeks after his 17th birthday are deserving of the national protests since the verdict was handed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful. Except, of course, for in Oakland, where the usual peabrain remnants of Occupy used the occasion of the verdict -- on the heels of the release of the movie &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; about the 2009 killing of Oscar Grant -- as an excuse to trash downtown and attack people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 350,000 people have signed a petition by the NAACP calling on the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. They believe that Zimmerman, who is half-white and half-Peruvian, singled out Martin and ultimately killed him for no other reason than that he was African-American and wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called Martin's killing &quot;tragic and unnecessary&quot; and said the department is investigating to determine whether to file federal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of the debate has been about the role that racial profiling played in the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet I think the main focus ought to be on the insanity of Florida's gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law allows people to defend themselves with force, including deadly force, if they feel threatened in their home, business, car, or a place where they &quot;have a legal right to be&quot; -- rather than retreat if they fear for their lives. The police in Sanford waited 44 days to arrest Zimmerman, in part, because of the right to use force under &quot;Stand Your Ground,&quot; although his lawyers did not use that defense in the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 21 states have versions of the same law, which are an open invitation to vigilantism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida law is so broad it can be interpreted to allow people to use lethal force anytime if they believe their lives are in danger. Nine months after Martin was killed, Jordan Davis, another 17-year-old African-American was gunned down in a gas station parking lot in Jacksonville, Fla. Michael Dunn, 45, who is white, is accused of shooting into a parked car where Davis was sitting because he and his friends wouldn't turn down their music. He has been charged with second-degree murder and goes to trial in September. He is using the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law in his defense. Dunn claimed that he thought Davis and his friends had a gun but none was found in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn, at least, was arrested, unlike Zimmerman, who wasn't charged until the case generated national outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his arrest isn't going to bring Davis back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many more Martins and Davises must there be?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- More than 3,000 miles and 36 hours removed from the verdict that set off weekend protests marred by violence and vandalism, Oakland's battered downtown cleaned up on Monday, with merchants boarding up windows and city workers washing trashed streets and storefronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager, prompted mostly peaceful weekend protests in San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, however -- the city where Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a BART police officer and where the Oakland Police Department is under federal supervision in part over a failure to stop racial profiling -- nightfall led to rowdy, chaotic protests that, in a few instances, turned violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loosely organized protest of about 150 people late Saturday night resulted in widespread vandalism, and a few protesters beat one man in a Broadway doorway near Frank H. Ogawa Plaza until other protesters ended the skirmish. The man was helped to his feet and did not appear seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group shattered numerous storefront windows, spray-painted buildings and a police car, and started several small fires in the streets. No arrests were reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's demonstration began peacefully with a two-hour afternoon march from downtown to West Oakland and back, ending with protesters sitting in the intersection of 14th Street and Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, a small group of protesters started heading north on Telegraph Avenue and quickly turned violent, attacking a KTVU photographer and a Bay Area News Group photographer who suffered minor injuries when he was kicked on the ground and his camera was ripped from his shoulder. Police made only one arrest, of someone who refused to disperse and did not have identification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses along Telegraph Avenue and Broadway took the brunt of the damage, with 61 windows broken or shattered at 14 buildings, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interim Police Chief Sean Whent, who surveyed the damage on Monday afternoon, said his department was not aware jurors in the Zimmerman trial were deliberating over the weekend, so it had only eight to 10 officers immediately available on Saturday to police an increasingly unruly crowd of about 150 protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if he was happy about the staffing level, Whent said: &quot;No, not at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interim chief said his department is reviewing surveillance footage in an attempt to make additional arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, duct tape was holding together windows at Awaken Cafe on Broadway. A flier was taped next to it: &quot;This window will be fixed later today. When will the U.S. justice system?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the 1400 block of Broadway, which has been hit hard by vandalism during protests over the years, all six ground floor windows were boarded up at Foot Locker, and a few doors down, four windows were damaged at the Oaklandish store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vandalism was a first for Oaklandish, which opened on Broadway in July 2011. The store sells Oakland-themed apparel and donates a portion of its proceeds to local community organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't necessarily think it was targeted but who's to say,&quot; said Natalie Nadimi, the company's community engagement manager. &quot;I don't know if there's any rhyme or reason to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oaklandish has no plans to move from the heart of downtown, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really represent what Oakland is about and where it's going,&quot; said Nadimi. &quot;There's no question we are going to stay here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 people were inside Dogwood, an Uptown bar, on Saturday night when protesters smashed the front windows using bicycle u-locks, said owner Alexeis Filipello. Employees guarded the front of the store, and were &quot;physically pushing them away,&quot; Filipello said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 45 minutes later, Oakland police arrived. She said she went out seeking assistance and warned officers about a group of approximately 50 people burning trash cans on the 17th Street side of the bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically the police officer said, 'There's nothing I can do and I don't care,'&quot; Filipello said. &quot;It was such a 'not-our-problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When is enough, enough?&quot; she asked. &quot;How are we supposed to get help?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bar reopened Monday at 4 p.m. As for the protest planned Monday evening in Oakland? &quot;We'll just see what happens,&quot; Filipello said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- A crowd of several hundred people protesting the acquittal of George Zimmerman in Florida briefly shut down traffic on Interstate 880 during a lengthy march Monday evening, blocking numerous streets before a group of more than 100 people scuffled with police shortly after 11 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one person was injured when he was struck on the head with a hammer or a similar object. Witnesses said a protester was injured and writhing in pain at Broadway and 16th Street after apparently being struck in the shoulder by a police projectile. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late-night skirmishes began after police charged at several vandals who smashed windows at the Men's Warehouse at 15th Street and Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police deployed flash-bang grenades; protesters threw fireworks at lines of officers wearing riot gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters later marched up Broadway and Telegraph Avenue, where people stood in front of bars and restaurants to protect them from window-smashing vandals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A waiter was hit with what appeared to be a hammer while protecting the windows at Flora, a restaurant at the corner of Telegraph and 19th Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Protesters with black masks approached the window and tried to bang at it,&quot; said bartender Phillip Ricafort. &quot;(The waiter) said, 'Don't do that!' and the guy turned around and smacked him in the face with a hammer&quot; or another metal object.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was gruesome,&quot; said Ricafort. He said his co-worker was bleeding from the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vandals also targeted Flora's windows over the weekend; several windows were still boarded up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man's co-workers were helping him ice his head on a chair in the back of the restaurant as they waited for an ambulance. Police also stopped to check on them before marching on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening began peacefully, though police were soon challenged as protesters shifted directions in an attempt to stay ahead of the officers keeping tabs on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters chanted &quot;Trayvon&quot; as they marched through downtown Oakland and then around Lake Merritt. Several protesters wearing masks tagged buildings as they marched. An American flag was burned at the intersection of Lakeshore and El Embarcadero near the eastern tip of Lake Merritt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cat-and-mouse game between protesters and police extended to Twitter, where protest sympathizers listening to the police scanner reported police directives for marchers to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mutual aid call from Oakland brought law enforcement officers from at least nine other departments, including the California Highway Patrol, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office and police departments in Berkeley, San Leandro, Hayward, Pleasanton, Union City, Fremont and Newark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said they had arrested nine people, including one juvenile, on misdemeanor and felony charges ranging from assault with a deadly weapon to vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the nine suspects arrested, three were Oakland residents, according to Oakland police Officer Johnna Watson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters gathered around 6 p.m., rallying in Frank Ogawa Plaza before moving south and walking up onramps to Interstate 880 at Broadway around 7:15 p.m. Police quickly swarmed the onramp, herding protesters off the roadway and arresting at least one person before reopening all lanes around 7:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several demonstrators linked arms in front of motorists, while others chanted &quot;If LA can do it, we can do it too.&quot; One officer shouted at them, &quot;You've got to go. You will go to jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest then moved through Chinatown, heading around the lake's west shore. Protesters were headed off by police as they attempted to walk onto Interstate 580 at Lakeshore Avenue shortly before 9 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 250 demonstrators were still on the march around 10 p.m. when the group encountered police outside the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse. The group headed back toward downtown, where lines of riot gear-clad police attempted to cut them off as officials read dispersal orders over loudspeakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests also were reported in Los Angeles on Monday as the nation continued to deal with the acquittal of Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager who was returning home from a trip to the grocery store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case prompted a national debate over racial profiling and the Saturday's verdict by a Sanford, Fla. jury prompted mostly peaceful weekend protests in San Jose, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, however -- a city that has become accustomed to raucous demonstrations since Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a BART police officer four years ago -- nightfall led to rowdy, chaotic protests that, in a few instances, turned violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loosely organized protest of about 150 people late Saturday night resulted in widespread vandalism, and a few protesters beat one man in a Broadway doorway near Frank H. Ogawa Plaza until other protesters ended the skirmish. The man was helped to his feet and did not appear seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group shattered numerous storefront windows, spray-painted buildings and a police car, and started several small fires in the streets. No arrests were reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's demonstration began peacefully with a two-hour afternoon march from downtown to West Oakland and back, ending with protesters sitting in the intersection of 14th Street and Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, a small group of protesters started heading north on Telegraph Avenue and quickly turned violent, attacking a KTVU photographer and a Bay Area News Group photographer who suffered minor injuries when he was kicked on the ground and his camera was ripped from his shoulder. Police made only one arrest, of someone who refused to disperse and did not have identification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses along Telegraph Avenue and Broadway took the brunt of the damage from the weekend protests, with 61 windows broken or shattered at 14 buildings, according to police.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Two consecutive nights of protests over George Zimmerman's acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin brought several assaults and many thousands of dollars in damages but only one arrest -- a dissonance some Oakland businesses and leaders find hard to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While few protesters resorted to violence and vandalism, rage over the verdict was real and raw in this city. But with Oakland police under unprecedented federal oversight for past transgressions and the city having just agreed to pay millions in legal settlements for its handling of previous protests, officers clearly reacted with a very light hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a little bit frustrating to see no action,&quot; said Natalie Nadimi, community engagement manager for Oaklandish, an apparel store that had four windows smashed Saturday. &quot;I don't know if no action is the appropriate solution. There needs to be a middle ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interim police Chief Sean Whent, who surveyed the damage Monday, said police were lightly staffed Saturday and caught off guard by the initial protests. Whent said investigators are reviewing surveillance footage in an attempt to make more arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Jean Quan said the city's residents and merchants must speak out clearly and forcefully against such criminal acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not acceptable,&quot; Quan said Monday, though she added police aren't to blame. &quot;No number of police are probably alone going to be able to do it. ... Can we afford to have cops watching 20 people every night all night? These people just have to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People in the city are pretty tired. We're pretty weary of people coming and doing this and particularly giving us a bad image. ... It's a city that's very sad and very mad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windows were smashed, walls and windows were spray-painted and a Bay Area News Group photographer and KTVU cameraman were attacked, as a small number resorted to violence and vandalism Saturday and Sunday nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pair of police officers who were told of the photographer's injury didn't get out of their van Sunday but rather continued following the crowd as it moved up Telegraph Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That doesn't sound right to me, doesn't sound very professional,&quot; said Sam Walker, a University of Nebraska, Omaha, criminal justice professor who has consulted for the Oakland police and U.S. Justice Department on use of force. &quot;To not make arrests when you see a reporter or somebody else being attacked makes no sense at all -- that's almost an invitation to more criminal conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person was arrested later on an unrelated charge of failing to disperse after police declared the march an unlawful assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses on Broadway near Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, a gathering point for protesters, have been easy targets for vandals during past protests. Juno Thomas, manager of the city's Business Assistance Center, once again made the rounds there Monday, offering the city's aid in boarding up windows, filing police reports and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadimi said police were slow to respond to requests from Oaklandish to file a police report. But she said Oaklandish has no plans to move. &quot;We really represent what Oakland is about and where it's going,&quot; Nadimi said. &quot;There's no question we are going to stay here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 people were inside the Dogwood bar on Telegraph Avenue at 17th Street when protesters smashed the front windows with bicycle locks Saturday; employees rushed forward and were &quot;physically pushing them away,&quot; owner Alexeis Filipello said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police arrived about 45 minutes later, she warned them that a mob of about 50 was setting trash cans afire on 17th Street. &quot;Basically the police officer said, 'There's nothing I can do, and I don't care,'&quot; Filipello said. &quot;It was such a 'not-our-problem.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When is enough, enough?&quot; she asked Monday. &quot;How are we supposed to get help?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whent told reporters he thought most of the vandalism was committed by people who live outside Oakland. He said the department hadn't known that the Zimmerman jury would deliberate over the weekend, so only eight to 10 officers were immediately available Saturday to police a protest of 150 people that grew increasingly violent and destructive. When asked if he was happy about the staffing, Whent replied, &quot;No, not at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker was amazed by this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How out of it are they? You couldn't find a cable channel that wasn't covering the trial and anticipating the verdict,&quot; he said. &quot;A much better job can be done, even in this difficult type of situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But University of South Carolina professor Geoffrey Alpert, an expert in police decision-making and use of force, said it's not easy for a department -- especially one so roundly criticized for past decisions -- to strike a balance between overreaction and under-reaction. &quot;They may not be finding a sweet spot, but most departments don't,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police agencies sometimes believe it's better for a disturbance like this to run its course than to put protesters and officers alike at risk in a head-on clash, Alpert said. &quot;And that's not a bad strategy. If their intelligence shows it's not organized, there aren't outsiders and the fires aren't being fueled with dynamite, maybe it's better to let people vent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they arrived for the Sunday worship service at Bethel Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, parishioners in the predominantly black neighborhood of Newtown in Sarasota shared their dismay and disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The topic on their minds was the same as elsewhere in churches and on street corners across the nation: the not guilty verdict in the murder trial of George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have mixed emotions,&quot; Pastor John Walker Jr. said as he collected his thoughts. &quot;I'm angry because of the whole situation ... The situation never should have escalated to that point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a jury in Sanford acquitted Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Zimmerman, who was on Neighborhood Watch duty in a gated community, disregarded a police dispatcher's advice that he not follow Martin, a pedestrian whom Zimmerman regarded as suspicious. The two engaged in a fight that resulted in Martin being shot in the heart and Zimmerman claiming self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker and several of his parishioners said they believe Martin was a victim of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's fate makes him worry about his 25-year-old son and 15-year-old nephews, Walker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're young African-American males. They're Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The justice system failed the Martin family,&quot; parishioner Olympia Baylou said. &quot;Our system has become so technical, we forget to look at common sense. What is going on in the state of Florida? You can kill someone and walk free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There should have been some kind of punishment,&quot; said churchgoer Patricia Storey. &quot;The prosecution should have provided more options. I blame the prosecution. The defense did its job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He should have gotten some kind of time,&quot; said fellow parishioner Denisa Graham said. &quot;A child is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the First Macedonia Missionary Church in Punta Gorda, the verdict generated discussion during adult Sunday school, church member Melody Washington said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The basic consensus of the group was that they couldn't believe he wasn't found guilty of something,&quot; Washington said. &quot;They were concerned about how the public would react. We pray for the country -- and for the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice or injustice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Fredd Atkins Park at U.S. 301 and Martin Luther King Way in Newtown, people were still coming to grips with the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some shook their heads as others discussed the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this happened in New York or Illinois, he would be in jail,&quot; Edward Weeks said. &quot;I mean, this is a grown man killing a child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brinda Smith, who also lives in the Newtown area, said the case reflects a double racial standard she experiences daily in Sarasota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When white people come to Newtown, the police protect them,&quot; Smith said. &quot;But we can't go out walking on Bird Key because they'll call the cops on us. Same thing probably goes on in Sanford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than five miles away, pedestrians on St. Armands Circle offered other views about the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackie Smith said she is upset that Zimmerman will not face jail time, but believes the verdict was in accordance with Florida law. &quot;It's the law that's at fault,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It's morally wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith, who moved from Great Britain to Orlando four years ago, said Florida's lax gun laws lead to more deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others saw nothing wrong with Florida laws or the verdict. Beth Townley said the injuries to Zimmerman's head made her believe that he was fighting for his life. &quot;I don't think it was racially motivated,&quot; Townley said. &quot;George was attacked; he wasn't out to shoot someone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who attacked whom seemed to be the aspect most people disagreed about. Liz Cleveland, of Bradenton, said the calls between Zimmerman and the police made it evident to her that Zimmerman pursued Martin. &quot;I think Zimmerman was looking for trouble,&quot; Cleveland said. &quot;You don't need to bring a gun with you to patrol the neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others thought the 24-hour news cycle made the case into a national issue when it should have stayed in Seminole County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Broernan Jr. said he has purposefully tried to distance himself from the case, which has been easy since he is from Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public doesn't need to get involved,&quot; Broernan said while he was visiting Bradenton. &quot;This is an issue between two families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though emotions ran higher at Bethel CME, Walker preached a message that he said is a message he has conveyed numerous times before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My message is always about justice or injustice,&quot; Walker said. &quot;I just pray people will not react on emotion. I hope the community will come together -- and I don't just mean the African-American community. It's going to take the entire faith community to come together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Zimmerman, the Florida neighbourhood watch leader who was controversially acquitted on Saturday night of murdering an unarmed black teenager, is likely to face more legal action, it has emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year-old shot by Mr Zimmerman during a violent encounter between the pair at the Sanford housing development in February last year, are likely to launch a civil wrongful death suit, lawyers said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the &quot;outraged and heartbroken&quot; leader of America's largest black advocacy group has demanded that authorities pursue a federal civil rights case against Mr Zimmerman. Ben Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured Persons, said the case in which Mr Zimmerman, who is of mixed white-Hispanic parentage, followed then shot the unarmed black teenager met the benchmark for an inquiry by the Department of Justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developments came less than 24 hours after the jury of six women declared Mr Zimmerman, 29, not guilty of  second-degree murder following a three-week trial at the Seminole County criminal justice centre that heard the conflicting evidence of 56 witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors had portrayed the defendant as an angry vigilante who was &quot;fed up&quot; after a series of burglaries at his Retreat at Twin Lakes gated community and who wrongly assumed that Mr Martin, who was wearing a hooded top, was a criminal who was &quot;up to no good&quot; as he walked home in the rain with sweets and a soft drink he had just bought at a nearby shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, who faced life in jail if convicted, did not testify. His lawyer Mark O'Mara argued that Mr Martin was the aggressor in the violent encounter, breaking the defendant's nose with a &quot;sucker punch&quot; then slamming his head on to a concrete pavement, forcing his client to fire a single shot with his 9mm semi-automatic pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of mostly peaceful protests against the verdict were held at cities and churches across the US yesterday as Mr Jealous called on federal authorities to launch their own case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the jury in the criminal case accepted the self-defence argument, Mr Zimmerman was caught on a recording of a call to police using profanities, the words &quot;f*****g punks&quot; and &quot;these a**holes, they always get away&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jealous said: &quot;When you look at his comments and when you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighbourhood about how they felt, especially targeted by him, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jealous released a statement immediately after the jury's decision that followed more than 16 hours of deliberations. &quot;We are outraged and heartbroken over  [Saturday's] verdict. We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said yesterday that he had spoken to &quot;senior members&quot; of US attorney general Eric Holder's team and expressed hope they would continue the work of FBI investigators last summer who reviewed elements of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will review all that comes out in that, and then they will make a choice about whether or not they will pursue criminal civil rights charges,&quot; Mr Jealous said in an interview with TV network CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Robert Zimmerman expressed fears for his brother's future safety and said he would never again be able to live normally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly he's a free man in the eyes of the court but he's going be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; Mr Zimmerman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are factions, there are groups, there are people that would want to take the law into their own hands or be vigilantes in some sense if they think that justice was not served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his lawyer, Mr Zimmerman lives in hiding with his wife Shellie, wears a bulletproof vest, has not worked since the shooting and has been effectively bankrupted by the case. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WASHINGTON - The jury's verdict to acquit George Zimmerman in the shooting death ofTrayvon Martin can probably be blamed onprosecutorial overreaching, legal experts said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case, they say, was doomed by Florida prosecutors' decision to pursue a hard-to-prove second-degree murder conviction against Zimmerman - responding to the recommendations of a special prosecutor appointed in the wake of a nationwide outcry over the youth's killing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thetrial exposed the flaws of that decision and the weakness of the state's criminal case. Prosecutors could not prove Zimmerman was driven by &quot;ill will or hatred&quot; - the necessary elements of a murder case - when he got out of his vehicle on a rainy night and went after the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the confrontation that followed, they also could not prove Zimmerman struck the first blow. If the teenager turned in fear to attack the stranger who was pursuing him, Zimmerman could claim he acted in self-defense. If the jurors were in doubt as to who struck first, they were obliged to hand down an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's why few criminal law experts were surprised by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The prosecutors made a tactical error by charging this as second-degree murder,&quot; said Charles H. Rose, a professor at Stetson University College of Law. &quot;Their theory was that George Zimmerman picked out this young black kid and set out to do him harm. But at the trial, it became clear it didn't happen that way.&quot; He pointed to evidence showing Zimmerman had been injured in the fight and that a witness who saw the two struggling said it appeared the teenager was on top. A defense pathologist testified the forensic evidence was consistent with Zimmerman's claim that Martin was on top and hitting him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rose said prosecutors might have succeeded had they charged Zimmerman from the start with manslaughter or assault. &quot;Then you would be arguing that he was a wannabe cop who stepped over the line and did something stupid. That is very different than trying to prove he stalked Trayvon Martin with an intent to harm him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Near the end of the trial, prosecutors urged the jury to convict Zimmerman of the lesser charge of manslaughter. But it was too late then to refocus the case, several experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although the facts are tragic, I don't think they should have brought this as a murder case,&quot; said Laurie Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. &quot;It would have been more plausible to argue that Zimmerman was grossly negligent and that he brought on the confrontation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg. So this seemed like a good time to reread &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; Michael Shaara's novel about the battle. It is historical fiction at its best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, there is this: The book, which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1975, was turned down by 15 publishers. That's probably because Shaara started trying to sell it in 1971, and publishers figured the public was sick of war. All those years in Vietnam had taken their toll. It's fun to read a great book and realize that publishers turned it down. Sometimes the smart people aren't so smart. That is well worth remembering. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if that weren't enough, there is this: After Michael's death, his son, Jeffrey, wrote a prequel and a sequel to his father's book. A father and son trilogy. How cool is that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all that aside, the best thing about Civil War books is that we're still fighting it. Philosophically, not much was settled at Gettysburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a wonderful scene in &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; in which some of the Confederate officers are talking to a British observer about their cause. It is not about slavery, they insist. It is about the tyranny of the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear similar arguments about the tyranny of the federal government all the time, mostly in e-mail form. The arguments are not as well-stated as they are in the book, but truth is, people used to be better at expressing themselves. Maybe that's because they wrote letters instead of tweets. Letters from Civil War soldiers are often amazingly poignant. Even people without much formal education could write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for a deterioration in our writing skills, not much has changed. The same arguments divide us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, slavery is gone, but race remains a red-hot topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the happy talk a few years ago about finally reaching some kind of &quot;post racial&quot; stage was just that - happy talk. Sure, there is a black president now - half-black, actually - and that speaks to great progress, but look at the local fight about school transfers. I read about it, and I think of the south side of Chicago 50 years ago, but this sort of stuff probably goes back to the days of Reconstruction. From my perspective, it is a story of working-class whites' seeing their carefully constructed lives threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman case. I did not follow the case closely, but I know the general outlines of it. I was sure Zimmerman would be convicted of something. After all, Martin was walking down the street breaking no laws and Zimmerman got out of his vehicle with a gun to look for him. What does it matter if Martin hit Zimmerman first? If an armed man gets out of his car and comes looking for you, you are not required to just let him shoot you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But again, there is a great divide. Unlike the O.J. Simpson case, the divide this time is not strictly along racial lines. A great many whites think like I do, that Zimmerman had to be guilty of something. In this instance, the divide seems to be along ideological lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri was, and is, a border state. If put to a vote, we'd go south. Hey, we're thrilled to see the flagship university join the SEC. Of course, we don't hate any of our new rivals the way we hated the Kansas Jayhawks - and that does go back to the Civil War. We're friendly rivals with the schools from the old Confederacy. We're finally where we belong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, I've written about St. Louis' seceding from Missouri. We'll join Illinois as West East St. Louis. Those columns were written in fun, and I have received good-natured comments from readers in St. Charles. Please go, they say, and if you do secede, make the new boundary the Missouri River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes I think - seriously - that the two-country solution would be best. Conservatives and liberals seem so far apart these days. There is little common ground, and virtually nothing can get accomplished in Washington . At any given time, half the country hates the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is no way to live. If we were a married couple, our friends would tell us to get a divorce. You're both miserable, they'd say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is with the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think about it while I read &quot;The Killer Angels.&quot; For all practical purposes, it doesn't matter that Pickett was turned back at Cemetery Ridge. He just as well could have taken the hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war goes on. It's red and blue instead of blue and gray, but the fighting still rages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most surprising thing about the not-guilty verdict reached Saturday night in the trial of George Zimmerman for shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not the verdict itself, but a statement made by the special prosecutor in a press conference after the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case has never been about race, nor has it never been about the right to bear arms, not in the sense of proving this as a criminal case,&quot; said Angela B. Corey. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allowing for the unintentional double negative in her statement, and granted that she's a Republican who will have to face re-election back home in Jacksonville (though not until 2016), it could be she was right in the strict legal sense. The issue of race was raised overtly only once during the three-week trial, and that by a prosecution witness who quoted Mr. Martin as having described Mr. Zimmerman as a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; in a cellphone call moments before their fatal encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But can anyone think that race wasn't a factor in Mr. Zimmerman's decision to put Mr. Martin under surveillance in Sanford, Fla., on the night of Feb. 26, 2012? That a 17-year-old black youth wearing a hoodie didn't set off alarms with Mr. Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch captain and would-be cop? That his reference to &quot;Fu--ing punks&quot; and &quot;a--holes&quot; wasn't racially charged?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put it like this: Does anyone doubt that if Mr. Martin had been white, he wouldn't be dead?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can anyone doubt that but for Florida's absurdly generous expansion of the phrase &quot;right to bear arms,&quot; Mr. Zimmerman would have been convicted?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, does anyone doubt that a 12-member jury (Florida is one of the few states that use six jurors in noncapital felonies) would have come to a different conclusion? Seminole County, Fla., is 82 percent white, but with a black victim, a black juror or two might have brought some different cultural experiences to the deliberations. The jury of five white women and one Hispanic woman could have used some help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, but it's not what you believe that counts but what you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and that was too high a bar for Ms. Corey's prosecutors. There were no eye witnesses to counter Mr. Zimmerman's version of what happened that night in Sanford's gated Twin Lakes subdivision. Forensic evidence was at least suggestive that Mr. Zimmerman was telling the truth about having been pounded in a fight and having shot upwards at his attacker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was no ordinary skinny 17-year-old armed with merely a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea, the defense said. This was an experienced street-fighter pounding on a slovenly, out-of-shape victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And here is the key: Florida's 2005 &quot;stand your ground&quot; law places the burden of proof on prosecutors. If a guy says he was in fear of his life, then it's up to prosecutors to prove he wasn't. A guy doesn't have to avoid a confrontation, and if things go badly, he is free to use deadly force. Being governed by fear is enshrined in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida law has NRA-approved language, very similar to language in Missouri law. Mr. Zimmerman had a concealed-carry permit for his Kel-Tec 9 mm semi-automatic (about $300 retail). And even if he initiated the confrontation, he was free under Florida law to end it with deadly force - though how he got the gun out of its holster while allegedly being pummeled by Mr. Martin remains a matter of some dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we want is responsible use when someone feels they have to use a gun to take a life,&quot; Ms. Corey told the press conference. &quot;They have to be responsible in their use and we believe that this case was all [along] about boundaries and that George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boundaries? Shooting an unarmed kid is legal? Who was this Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the second coming of Bruce Lee? Not even in the Wild West were you allowed to shoot unarmed people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make no mistake: At its basic level, Florida v. Zimmerman was about race and it was about guns. It was about the color of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's skin. It was about the fact that someone of George Zimmerman's temperament was allowed to carry a gun - and use it recklessly if he got nervous. He makes an unlikely Second Amendment hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is deeply divided on racial issues. It is further deeply divided on the subject of guns. We ought to be able to come together on laws that say you can't shoot unarmed people, but too many of us are governed by fear itself. That is the tragedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Readers respond to Saturday's decision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If George Zimmerman had followed the police dispatcher's instruction not to follow the person wearing the hoodie, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would have arrived safely at his father's apartment to enjoy the candy he had purchased at a local store (&quot;Zimmerman not guilty on all counts,&quot; July 14). Regardless of the verdict, Zimmerman must live with this inescapable fact for the rest of his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHIL JOHNSON, Edina </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesson of the tragedy of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is that we as parents must teach our children respect for authority. To my generation, authority meant parents, adults, schoolteachers and law enforcement. We as youths were taught to respect them and to act politely and deferentially with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any adult could question our behavior, and often did so. We were taught to politely explain what we were doing - but above all, not to get into a confrontation with authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was minding my own business, driving in my own lane when another driver tried to merge into my lane, exactly where my car was. The insurance company said I was 5 percent responsible because I was out on the road. Why isn't George Zimmerman at least 5 percent responsible for following Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and causing the interaction which resulted in Trayvon's death?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger toward Zimmerman in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy is mostly a waste of otherwise productive energy. This outcome is, alas, a completely expected result of the country's runaway gun lust and the multitude of state &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws. We should be up in (fleshy) arms over this dangerous legislation. And we should show solidarity with those standing up to the juggernaut, like our own governor, who vetoed a similar bill last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury verdict in the Zimmerman trial has bolstered my confidence that we are indeed a country of laws, not of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One could assert that Zimmerman may not be innocent, but since the prosecution was not successful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in meeting their burden of proof, he is not guilty. An excellent lesson that in a court of law, justice and emotion are not compatible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is refreshing to me after seeing some finders of fact in our Supreme Court seem to first decide what result they wanted, then go through a tortured analysis to reach that result. In my opinion recent examples of that flawed process are Chief Justice John Roberts in deciding the Affordable Care Act, and Justice Anthony Kennedy in deciding the Defense of Marriage Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A boy died. A segment of our society painted him to be a golden boy wearing a hood. We don't know. I certainly don't know. From what I first read, it seemed that George Zimmerman was his own wannabe crusader who wanted to save the world from society's &quot;cancers.&quot; In this scenario, it played out to be a young unarmed man. Zimmerman shouldn't have pursued; the nation has read the transcript. The kid may have felt stalked, and took it upon himself to protect himself, whether that was right or wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a gun changes the game, no matter the color of your skin. Having a certain color of skin changes the game no matter the incident. We are a judgmental society. We also, at times, appear to have a flawed justice system - that reality has played itself many times before Saturday's verdict and will continue to do so in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, now as we look to today's blue sky, and return to our local routines, and justify our existence and opinion - what change lies ahead, and how can we be a part of that raised consciousness without using negative energy to steer our direction? We must seriously look tragedy in the eye and negotiate a forever-driven desire to be that change, to facilitate raising our awareness rather than slamming the door shut, again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1942, my mother took me to a concert of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra at Northrop Auditorium. She explained to me what the orchestra was, what it represented to our society and why it was an important institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know we thoroughly enjoyed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the music. Many years later, I was privileged to participate in the first televised broadcast of the symphony, bringing fine music to even wider audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over these many years, I have watched the orchestra gradually improve to become the celebrated, world-class Minnesota Orchestra. And now, somehow - no matter that the orchestra has existed for more than eight decades, bringing accolades and approval to the Twin Cities and to the state - all of that is gone. Gone in a flash. In less than one year, the orchestra board has managed single-handedly to destroy all that work and effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I congratulate you on the board for your single-minded dedication. I hope you all sleep well at night. What's your next target?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can't help wonder how differently the past year might have turned out if the Minnesota Orchestra board had begun by praising our wonderful musicians to the skies and telling us, in an all-out fundraising campaign, just what it would take to keep them. If it had lifted them up as the outstanding community asset they have become instead of painting them as adversaries, isn't it just possible that the board might have raised the money needed and avoided this whole sad year of &quot;musical starvation?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was pleased to read a recent letter writer's fond memories of attending Minnesota Symphony Orchestra performances at Northrop Auditorium. And, while I have no dispute with a subsequent letter writer's assessment that Northrop's acoustics were less than ideal, it is important to note that Northrop is currently undergoing a complete revitalization. The new venue, scheduled to reopen in April of 2014, will be a vast improvement, with state-of-the-art acoustics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;On that we can unite, even if the deeper issues are unresolved.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too much to hope, of course, that Saturday night's not-guilty verdict in the Florida murder trial of neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman will put to rest the broad social resentments and suspicions that turned the case into a media sensation and a culture-war battleground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And no more consensus would have followed had Zimmerman been convicted for fatally shooting 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in February 2012 after Zimmerman's tailing of the unarmed youth led to a violent confrontation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whatever one's view of this tragic story, it is worth trying to recognize a measure of justice achieved through the painful legal process that has followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who sympathize with Zimmerman are doubtless relieved by his acquittal. But they may also interpret it as confirmation of their view that he should never have been charged - that his prosecution was a persecution fueled by racial and anti-gun politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may have been Zimmerman's misfortune that for many he came to symbolize vexing social issues reaching far beyond the specific facts of his fateful encounter with Martin - racial profiling, the persistent epidemic of gun violence, and the many forms of injustice and disadvantage that burden young black males in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those concerns, however, are real and legitimate. It was almost inevitable that special scrutiny would attach to a shocking tragedy seeming to involve them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back when it remained unclear whether Zimmerman would be charged, many Americans simply found it implausible to imagine that, had the roles been reversed (had an unarmed white teenager walking home from a convenience store been shot to death by a black man), the shooter would have gone free without the facts even being presented to a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now a jury has considered those facts, vigorously presented and debated in a well-conducted trial. That jury has unanimously found Zimmerman not guilty, and it is worth reviewing what that judgment does and does not mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict does not mean that Zimmerman's claim to have acted in self-defense has been proven. It means that the state could not prove &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; that Zimmerman's actions constituted a crime - the high standard America's system of justice demands before the government can take away a person's freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears that, for jurors, the knowable facts simply were not sufficiently consistent with the prosecution's portrait of Zimmerman as a reckless and malicious killer. For example, Zimmerman called police before the shooting and waited for them afterward - actions that seem unlikely if he had harbored criminal intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But surely this disaster, for all concerned, has reiterated one lesson, especially critical in this era of coast-to-coast concealed-carry gun laws. That is the importance of avoiding all unnecessary confrontations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is around respect for the rule of the law and the principle of due process that Americans can unite even in a polarized time. The nation must seek that unity now, taking comfort from the knowledge that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death was not ignored nor minimized. The facts surrounding it were fully aired and fiercely contested - and were resolved in accordance with law and within the limits of an imperfect human system of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans, meanwhile, must take from this heartbreaking ordeal a renewed commitment to cleansing their society of violence and of racial prejudice in all its forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RESPONSES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama called for calm yesterday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, saying his death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleared by a Florida jury on Saturday, Zimmerman walked free from criminal charges in the shooting death of Martin, but still faces public outrage, a possible civil suit and demands for a federal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six jurors who deliberated for 16 hours over two days found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in a case that has polarised the US public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he acted in self-defence, while civil rights activists said the shooting was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken,&quot; Obama, the first black US president, said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who last year said that &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon&quot;, added that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president urged Americans to broaden &quot;the circle of understanding and compassion&quot; in their communities and put some of the emotion the case has aroused into curtailing gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,&quot; he said. &quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the way to honour Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics contend that Zimmerman wrongly suspected 17-year-old Martin of being a criminal because he was black, making it a civil rights issue, while gun rights supporters saw Zimmerman as a persecuted hero who was exercising his right to bear arms assured by the US constitution's second amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyers argued that he acted in self-defence on February 26 last year when he and Martin met inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford. They accuse civil rights advocates of wrongly injecting the issue of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was such a shame. The whole case nearly destroyed George from day one. That they put a racism spin on this prosecution just hurt him very deeply,&quot; said John Donnelly, a close friend of Zimmerman who testified in the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, spotted Martin from his car and called the police, believing Martin to be acting suspiciously. The teenager, who was staying in the neighbourhood at the home of his father's fiance&Atilde;&copy;, was walking back from a shop where he had bought sweets and a soft drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, after Zimmerman got out of his car, the two engaged in a fight that left Zimmerman with a bloody nose and head injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encounter ended when Zimmerman shot Martin once through the heart with a pistol.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead, George Zimmerman has been acquitted, and millions of people are outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some politicians are demanding a second prosecution of Zimmerman, this time for hate crimes. Others are blaming the tragedy on &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws, which they insist must be repealed. Many who saw the case as proof of racism in the criminal justice system see the verdict as further confirmation. Everywhere you look, people feel vindicated in their bitter assumptions. They want action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's how Martin ended up dead. It's how Zimmerman ended up with a bulletproof vest he might have to wear for the rest of his life. It's how activists and the media embarrassed themselves with bogus reports. The problem at the core of this case wasn't race or guns. The problem was assumption, misperception, and overreaction. And that cycle hasn't ended with the verdict. It has escalated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I almost joined the frenzy. This week I was going to write that Zimmerman pursued Martin against police instructions and illustrated the perils of racial profiling. But I hadn't followed the case in detail. So I sat down and watched the closing arguments: nearly seven hours of video in which the prosecution and defense went point by point through the evidence as it had been hashed out at the trial. Based on what I learned from the videos, I did some further reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turned out I had been wrong about many things. The initial portrait of Zimmerman as a racist wasn't just exaggerated. It was completely unsubstantiated. It's a case study in how the same kind of bias that causes racism can cause unwarranted allegations of racism. Some of the people Zimmerman had reported as suspicious were black men, so he was a racist. Members of his family seemed racist, so he was a racist. Everybody knew he was a racist, so his recorded words were misheard as racial slurs, proving again that he was a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 911 dispatcher who spoke to Zimmerman on the fatal night didn't tell him to stay in his car. Zimmerman said he was following a suspicious person, and the dispatcher told him, &quot;We don't need you to do that.&quot; Chief prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda conceded in his closing argument that these words were ambiguous. De la Rionda also acknowledged, based on witness and forensic evidence, that both men &quot;were scraping and rolling and fighting out there.&quot; He pointed out that the wounds, blood evidence, and DNA didn't match Zimmerman's story of being thoroughly restrained and pummeled throughout the fight. But the evidence didn't fit the portrait of Martin as a sweet-tempered child, either. And the notion that Zimmerman hunted down Martin to accost him made no sense. Zimmerman knew the police were on the way. They arrived only a minute or so after the gunshot. The fight happened in a public area surrounded by townhouses at close range. It was hardly the place or time to start shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't make Zimmerman a hero. It just makes him a reckless fool instead of a murderer. In a post-verdict press conference, his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, claimed that &quot;the evidence supported that George Zimmerman did nothing wrong,&quot; that &quot;the jury decided that he acted properly in self-defense,&quot; and that Zimmerman &quot;was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense. I'm glad that the jury saw it that way.&quot; That's completely wrong. The only thing the jury decided was that there was reasonable doubt as to whether Zimmerman had committed second-degree murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is guilty, morally if not legally, of precipitating the confrontation that led to Martin's death. He did many things wrong. Mistake No. 1 was inferring that Martin was a burglar. In his 911 call, Zimmerman cited Martin's behavior. &quot;It's raining, and he's just walking around&quot; looking at houses, Zimmerman said. He warned the dispatcher, &quot;He's got his hand in his waistband.&quot; He described Martin's race and clothing only after the dispatcher asked about them. Whatever its basis, the inference was false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mistake No. 2 was pursuing Martin on foot. Zimmerman had already done what the neighborhood watch rules advised: He had called the police. They would have arrived, questioned Martin, and ascertained that he was innocent. Instead, Zimmerman, packing a concealed firearm, got out and started walking after Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mistake No. 3 was Zimmerman's utter failure to imagine how his behavior looked to Martin. You're a black kid walking home from a convenience store with Skittles and a fruit drink. Some dude in a car is watching and trailing you. God knows what he wants. You run away. He gets out of the car and follows you. What are you supposed to do? In Zimmerman's initial interrogation, the police expressed surprise that he hadn't identified himself to Martin as a neighborhood watch volunteer. They suggested that Martin might have been alarmed when Zimmerman reached for an object that Zimmerman, but not Martin, knew was a phone. Zimmerman seemed baffled. He was so convinced of Martin's criminal intent that he hadn't considered how Martin, if he were innocent, would perceive his stalker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, meanwhile, was profiling Zimmerman. On his phone, he told a friend he was being followed by a &quot;creepy-a-- cracker.&quot; The friend -- who later testified that this phrase meant pervert -- advised Martin, &quot;You better run.&quot; She reported, as Zimmerman did, that Martin challenged Zimmerman, demanding to know why he was being hassled. If Zimmerman's phobic misreading of Martin was the first wrong turn that led to their fatal struggle, Martin's phobic misreading of Zimmerman may have been the second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In court, evidence and scrutiny have exposed these difficult, complicated truths. But outside the court, ideologues are ignoring them. Martin has become Emmett Till. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is using the verdict to attack Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which wasn't invoked in this case. The grievance industrial complex is pushing the Department of Justice to prosecute Zimmerman for bias-motivated killing, based on evidence that didn't even support a conviction for unpremeditated killing. Zimmerman's lawyers have teamed up with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, inadvertently, to promote the false message that Zimmerman's acquittal means our society thinks everything he did was OK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't OK. It was stupid and dangerous. It led to the unnecessary death of an innocent young man. It happened because two people -- their minds clouded by stereotypes that went well beyond race -- assumed the worst about one another and acted in haste. If you want to prevent the next Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy, learn from their mistakes. Don't paint the world in black and white. Don't declare the whole justice system racist, or blame every gun death on guns, or confuse acquittal with vindication. And the next time you see somebody who looks like a punk or a pervert, hold your fire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the uncertain evidence they were presented, the jury's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Stanford is no surprise, but it is no vindication of Zimmerman's actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict caused protests to be organized around the nation, including Tampa, by those who felt Zimmerman targeted Martin because he was black.  Zimmerman denied race was a factor.  The trial did not resolve the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second-degree murder charge Zimmerman faced may have been overblown and based more on political pressure than solid evidence. But even the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer's version of events revealed reckless behavior that needlessly jeopardized lives, including his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may not have intended to shoot anyone when he followed the teenager who was returning from buying a snack at a convenience store. But he assumed Martin was up to no good and, ignoring the instructions of a 911 operator, pursued him into a fatal conflict.If Zimmerman's account is truthful, he genuinely  may have been in fear of his life when he shot the unarmed Martin, who he says was on top of him and slamming his head onto the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With conflicting versions of what happened that February 2012 night, it is understandable jurors failed to find the Sanford man guilty of either second-degree murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murder charge would have required jurors to conclude Zimmerman acted with ill will, hatred or spite. The manslaughter  charge required that they determined he acted without lawful justification. If Martin was indeed beating Zimmerman, then a conviction on either charge would be difficult. Zimmerman, however foolish his prior actions, could say he was defending himself. He probably wouldn't even need the protection of  Florida's lenient Stand Your Ground law.The case has caused widespread debate about racial profiling. That discussion, as the Martin family lawyer pointed out after the verdict, may benefit the nation. But the jurors, who listened to three weeks of testimony, had to attend the details of the case, not its political ramifications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their judgment may be appropriate, however unsatisfying. Yet the fact remains: A teenager is dead for no good reason. Zimmerman may not have committed a crime, but he caused a tragedy. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA - Standing on top of a white rectangular cement block in front of the water fountains at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park, Life Malcolm spoke passionately into a megaphone about the value of black life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reality is there is no value of African life in this country, said Malcolm, 38, speaking to about 200 people gathered about 20 hours after a jury in Sanford found George Zimmerman not guilty in the February 2012 killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every few minutes, a car would drive south on Ashley Drive, its occupants honking and waiving at the demonstrators, many holding signs reading Justice 4 Trayvon and End Racial Oppression.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rally, organized by the Coalition for Justice for Trayvon, brought together a diverse crowd of blacks, whites, Latinos, young and old, men and women.There was anger at the verdict, cries of racial inequity and calls for justice. Marisol Marquez, who helped organize the rally, said the Zimmerman acquittal was endemic of a justice system that works against people of color.We are going to protest for justice since the government system won't bring us justice, said Marquez, 26, who had just returned to Tampa from Sanford, where she was among those demonstrating against Zimmerman as the jury deliberated and later after the verdict was announced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his speech, Malcolm, 38, a member of the Black Peoples Advancement &amp; Defense Organization, compared the Zimmerman verdict with the cases of Jennifer Porter - a white woman who served house arrest and probation after killing two black children with her car and then fleeing - and Michael Vick, the black NFL quarterback who served jail time for killing dogs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jennifer Porter didn't serve a day in jail, while Michael Vick, a rich Negro, went to jail for killing six or eight dogs, said Malcolm, who has the word DEATH spelled out in bullet shells tattooed on his left arm and the word LIFE written in bullet shells tattooed on his right. Look at the juxtaposition of those two sentences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury's acquittal of  Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, in the killing of Martin, a black teen, is a sign that the system is broken, said Malcolm, echoing many others at the rally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then he urged action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What's a life worth? A life is worth a life. We have to make it clear that if one of us is killed, then a life is required. You can't just get off scot-free. I guarantee you when that equation becomes balanced, we'll see fewer and fewer of us killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After climbing off the barrier, Malcolm said that I'm not calling for violence for violence sake, but I want to make it clear that an African life is worth a white life and any other human life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a few more speakers took turns at the megaphone, the protesters marched to the Sam M. Gibbons U.S. Courthouse calling for residents to join a national protest movement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests are planned across the country after the case unleashed a nationwide debate about racial profiling, self-defense and justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the verdict late Saturday, protesters in Oakland, Calif., broke windows, burned flags and started small street fires. In Tallahassee, about 200 demonstrators marched carrying signs that read Racism is Not Dead and Who's Next? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Marquez and other speakers excoriated the trial's outcome, Teresa Keeys stood on the sidewalk on Florida Street quietly holding a sign that read Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is my son and a bag with a picture of her son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps more than anyone else in the crowd, Keeys, 47, could feel the pain of the slain teen's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day Martin was killed while walking through a Sanford subdivision, 26-year-old Christopher Keeys was gunned down in Philadelphia. He was shot three times and died. Keeys said she moved to Tampa to escape the memories of her son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keeys, who is black, thinks her son's killer also is black, but she said that, ultimately, race doesn't matter when a life is taken. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice matters, she said. If blood is left on someone's hands, you should be held accountable. George Zimmerman should be held accountable in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering an unarmed black teenager, black religious leaders in the Tampa Bay area called during their Sunday sermons for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice was done, based on how the law says it's supposed to go,&quot; the Rev. Desmond Cribb, a minister at the Bethel Community Baptist Church in St. Petersburg, told a room packed with worshippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line is: We said let justice prevail, so we have to be able to accept that,&quot; he counseled, telling the congregation to &quot;let it go.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests across the country have drawn hundreds of supporters for Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old who Zimmerman shot and killed in February 2012 in Sanford. Zimmerman said the killing was in self-defense, and on Saturday night a jury acquitted him of murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April last year, Martin's parents were part of a town hall meeting at Beulah Baptist Institutional Church in Tampa that drew some 400 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, the Rev. W. James Favorite told more than 100 people at the morning service that the verdict was an &quot;injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is really very irritating that a black teenager (can be) shot ... and then have someone claim they were defending&quot; himself, Favorite told parishioners. &quot;It doesn't make sense to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Favorite criticized a justice system that would try a man for killing a black youth and allow a jury of six women - five of them white and one Hispanic - on the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a right to a jury of our peers,&quot; he said. &quot;Where are our peers in this situation?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;There is not justice for African-Americans in this country. We may as well accept it. ... We do not like that kind of justice. Lady Justice has her blindfold off in regards to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Favorite finished by saying, &quot;But we can pray. And that's what I urge us to do today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many churchgoers said Sunday they were struggling to make peace with the jury's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who stayed up late Saturday to hear the verdict said they spent the night worrying, thinking of their children and grandchildren and the seeming randomness of Zimmerman's encounter with Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Betty Nelson, 74, who attended the 7:45 a.m. service at Mt. Zion Progressive Baptist Church in St. Petersburg, said she lay awake for hours, praying for her grandsons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criminal case was alluded to, but not explicitly mentioned, during the St. Petersburg church's early morning sermon, a fact that Nelson said spoke to the black community's willingness to move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Contrary to what everybody thinks, black people are not out there ready to riot,&quot; she said. &quot;We believe in justice and we believe in the court system. Even when we don't like it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the parking lot of Bethel Community, following Rev. Cribb's sermon, Katherine Jones, 87, said she was surprised to hear the minister say justice had been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That might be it,&quot; she said, referring to the possibility for closure. But nothing about the jury's decision struck her as just, she said. &quot;The people are not satisfied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cribb urged the congregation to think of Martin as an example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to teach our young men how to realize that sometimes the best thing to do is just walk away,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody in Florida has a gun, everybody. You never know what you might be up against.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have asked to remain anonymous, declining to talk with the media. It's a move that makes all kinds of sense for them. Speaking out publicly now will focus the public's rage and disappointment on their lives in awful ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I hope the jurors in the George Zimmerman trial eventually decide to speak with one or two quality journalists about their decision to acquit the former neighborhood watch captain of murder and manslaughter charges in the shooting death of unarmed black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. (News outlets already are asking the judge to reconsider her decision to keep their names from the public.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, as dangerous as it may be for them to speak up, the rest of the country sorely needs to hear how they reached the decision they made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For proof of that, one need look only across the cable TV news landscape Saturday night after the verdict was announced. The actual decision was delivered lightning fast in a simple &quot;not guilty&quot; declaration. But that didn't stop cable news outlets from making a feast of the supposed motivations and meanings behind the verdict with the barest scraps of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Fox News, the acquittal wasn't enough for anchor Geraldo Rivera, who spent much of the channel's coverage insisting that Zimmerman should never have been charged with murder in the death of Martin, who was walking lawfully through a Sanford subdivision when he caught the watch captain's attention. Rivera blamed politics and public hysteria for the decision to arrest and charge Zimmerman, who shot the teen as the two were fighting in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rivera insisted the jury rejected second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman &quot;almost immediately,&quot; with no evidence. He also interviewed a jury consultant who assumed that, because a particular juror asked lots of questions during jury selection, she must have asked the vague question about manslaughter charges the jury floated during deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To think that (Zimmerman) acted out of hate, out of ill will, out of a depraved mind to profile racially and inflict punishment on this 17-year-old ... that is simply not the case,&quot; Rivera said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At MSNBC, anchors second-guessed the prosecution, stopping just short of accusing the attorneys of throwing the case, as host Melissa Harris-Perry wondered about the odd atmosphere during State Attorney Angela Corey's news conference. Corey's oddly jubilant tone came under scrutiny, along with accusations prosecutors failed to adequately probe inconsistencies in Zimmerman's story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some of the harshest words may have come on CNN, where Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., spoke with anchor Piers Morgan, accusing Martin's family of &quot;throwing the race card on the table&quot; after the killing, suggesting that civil rights activists wouldn't have pressured authorities into prosecuting his brother if he had been black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many more unsolved homicides in Chicago than there are in Sanford, Florida,&quot; said Robert Zimmerman, who seemed to forget that Martin's killing was never an unsolved homicide - civil rights activists protested because Sanford police knew who killed the teen and didn't seem inclined to arrest him. The interview only cemented grumblings about Twitter posts the brother has made that seemed to be borderline racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outpouring on cable TV news and social media - even Oprah Winfrey took flak for tweeting messages supportive of a show on her cable channel, seemingly oblivious to the Zimmerman verdict - was to be expected. Because so little of the actual trial centered on race issues, they have come roaring to the forefront in the post-verdict analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, which became a wall-to-wall event for cable news channels scrambling for ratings points, each twist in the proceedings was dissected like a football game, complete with re-enactments on HLN and armchair quarterbacking everywhere. With no statements from the jury, expect that dynamic to only get worse, as talking heads squeeze every drop of drama from a trial covered like a real-life version of a Law &amp; Order episode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk show host Steve Harvey tweeted &quot;a child is dead and the man that killed him is free,&quot; ending his message by asking &quot;my country tis of thee?&quot; Lena Dunham, creator and star of HBO's Girls, also tweeted shock over the verdict, noting &quot;my heart is with (Martin's mother) Sybrina Fulton, Rachel Jeantel, everyone who loved Trayvon and has been sent message his life didn't matter.&quot; Conservative pundit Ann Coulter, often criticized for her racially inflammatory language, wrote simply &quot;hallelujah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's family proved the most conciliatory of all on social media, with the teen's father Tracy Martin tweeting &quot;god blessed me and Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby proud of the FIGHT we along with all of you put up for him. GOD BLESS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all the verdict really may prove, as I have been saying for some time, is that this crime was missing an important piece of evidence: No objective witness saw how the fight between Martin and Zimmerman started, which is a key component to judging the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without someone besides Zimmerman saying definitively who was the aggressor - the watch captain says Martin attacked him - how do you get past reasonable doubt?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other questions also need an answer: Did Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which was included as part of the jury instruction, make a difference? Did the many prosecution witnesses who seemed to score points for the defense - including a medical examiner who said many times on the stand he couldn't remember details from the autopsy - make a difference?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did the jurors decline to clarify their request on information about the manslaughter charge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid all the bloviating to come on what this case means - along with efforts by the NAACP to push for a federal civil rights prosecution and perhaps a civil suit from Martin's parents - these questions stand out. And they can be answered only by six people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why I hope the jurors reconsider their stance and talk to America about how they reached their verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because, damaging as it may be for them to go public, it may be the only thing that can help heal the country.</SPAN></P>

He could be suspended from competition for at least six months. &quot;I don't have a sabotage story. I don't have any lies. I don't have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake,&quot; said Gay, 30, sobbing. &quot;I basically put my trust in someone and I was let down.&quot; He did not reveal the substance or who he was talking about. Also, former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell and Jamaican teammate Sherone Simpson tested positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington: A Florida jury on Saturday acquitted George Zimmerman,a white neighborhood volunteer watchman,in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,bringing to a close another epic courtroom saga that illustrated America's ceaseless struggle with racial issues.The panel of six women deliberated more than 16 hours over two days till late Saturday night before delivering the not guilty verdict,which drew immediate condemnation from some civil rights groups.&quot;Today,justice failed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and his family,&quot; Roslyn Brock,chairperson of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),said in a statement.&quot;We call immediately for the justice department to conduct an investigation into the civil rights violations committed against Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; This case has re-energized the movement to end racial profiling in the United States.Amid fears of violence from the outraged black community in some cities,civil rights activist Jesse Jackson tweeted within minutes of the acquittal: &quot;Avoid violence,it will lead to more tragedies.Find a way for self construction not deconstruction in this time of despair.&quot; The familiar story began on the night of February 26 last year when George Zimmerman,28,who is actually a multi-racial Hispanic-American,and was the neighborhood watch coordinator for a gated community in Sanford,Florida,shot dead Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,who was staying there temporarily,saying Martin had attacked him and he acted in self-defence.Prosecutors contended that Zimmerman was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who tracked down the teenager and shot him without justification.Zimmerman claimed that he was on a personal errand in his vehicle on the rainswept night when he noticed Martin inside the gated compound walking around &quot;suspiciously&quot; looking at all the houses.He called the Sanford police department to report the activity and then exited his vehicle,whereupon he said he had a violent encounter with Martin,subsequently fatally shooting him once in the heart at close range.Police arrived on the scene soon after and took Zimmerman into custody but released him without charges after five hours of questioning him.But the circumstances of Martin's death,including the fact that he was unarmed and police could not establish that he was involved in any criminal activity at the time of the encounter,pitched the story to the front pages of US media.Soon the case electrified America,mostly along racial lines,evoking previous such episodes,most famously the killing of 14-year old Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 because he flirted with a white woman.Even President Obama,father of two daughters,stepped into the minefield,cautiously saying,&quot;If I had a son,he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; That brief,generic interjection did not bring justice the African-American community looked forward to.Anger swept through black neighborhoods at the perceived miscarriage of justice.&quot;This is a heartbreaking moment.This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the old South,&quot; another NAACP spokesperson lamented.Jackson called it &quot;Old South Justice&quot; - a reference to white atrocities on black people in Southern United States in the pre-civil rights era.The last has not been heard of the case.Martin's family is expected to pursue a civil lawsuit.CASE DIARY On 26 February 2012,George Zimmerman,28,was patrolling a gated neighbourhood in the city of Sanford,Florida He had organized the neighbourhood watch after a rash of burglaries He spotted 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,wearing a hooded sweatshirt,walking back from a store to his father's fiancee's house He called 911 to report 'a real suspicious guy',a 'black male' walking around Zimmerman followed Martin,and the two engaged in altercation.One of them cried for help before Zimmerman fired one shot into Martin's chest Zimmerman pleaded self-defence when he was taken to police station Zimmerman's lawyers said Martin punched their client,slammed his head into the pavement and reached for his gun The case sparked a debate about racial profiling in the US </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SIX-woman jury has found neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in a racially charged trial that transfixed the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Mr Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict,'' Judge Deborah Nelson said soon after the decision was read yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court.'' Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict was read. His family, sitting behind him in the courtroom, smiled broadly. The family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not present. Scores of journalists and crowds of demonstrators had gathered outside the courthouse in the dark, awaiting the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the demonstrators were chanting, ``no justice, no peace''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury had deliberated for more than 16 hours since Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers insisted Zimmerman acted in self-defence after Martin, 17, wrestled him to the ground and started bashing his head into the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The killing in February last year ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders had called for calm on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``If Zimmerman is convicted, there should not be inappropriate celebrations, because a young man lost his life,'' veteran civil rights activist Rev Jesse Jackson a said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``If he is not convicted, we should avoid violence because it will only lead to more tragedies.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stoic vigils for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin continued into the night Sunday, as calming words from U.S. President Barack Obama and a pledge from Washington to review the case for possible civil rights violations tempered American anguish over the acquittal of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not guilty,&quot; the words uttered late Saturday by an all-female jury in Florida, left Zimmerman to an uncertain fate - free in the eyes of Florida law, yet a prisoner, likely for life, to global hostility for firing the bullet that killed an unarmed, Skittles-munching black teenager in February 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal teams on both sides anticipate a civil case will follow. But on Sunday, the U.S. Department of Justice added another dimension to the matter, announcing it has revived an investigation into whether Zimmerman's shooting of the 17-year-old was motivated by racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,&quot; the department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bone-dry legal statement belied deep-felt passions unleashed by Saturday's verdict, as marchers gathered for protest vigils in dozens of cities and towns across the country. A sign held high at Malcolm X park in Washington, D.C., was typical of the sombre, frustrated but largely peaceful mood: &quot;The people say guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A broader - and at times, toxic - reaction played out on social media, where the Zimmerman verdict was interpreted like a Rorschach ink-blot test for long-simmering American divisions on questions of race, gun rights, profiling, vigilantism and political ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, thrust once again into the role of comforter-in-chief, released a statement urging &quot;calm reflection&quot; out of respect for the fallen teen and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,&quot; said Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. . . . That's the way to honour Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears of a violent aftermath were muted by sober legal analysis at almost every stage of the Zimmerman trial, with a preponderance of observers predicting acquittal as the likeliest outcome. The case, many argued, was burdened from the start by prosecutorial overreach, with too little evidence to support a conviction of second-degree murder rather than manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversial Florida gun laws were also seen as favouring Zimmerman's case for self-defence. Though in the end his legal team largely avoided mention of Stand Your Ground, the Florida law giving a gunman the benefit of the doubt in moments of perceived threat, civil rights leaders seized upon the outcome as cause to repeal the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,&quot; NAACP president Benjamin Jealous said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others took issue with the rage playing out online, as agitators trolled both sides of the outcome, some calling for Zimmerman's murder, some gloating that the acquittal validates their pro-gun world view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative commentator Joe Scarborough, writing for Politico, called the social media spectacle a &quot;vivid display&quot; of the &quot;vulgar state of American political culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial, said Scarborough, widened America's already deep divide, with both sides scurrying to &quot;their shabby political corners&quot; to tweet &quot;hyperbolic political pronouncements on a judicial process that few of them knew anything about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scarborough added that while &quot;it is a fool's errand&quot; to second-guess the jury, he, too, retains the right to draw his own personal conclusions: &quot;like my belief that George Zimmerman is a racist idiot who chased an unarmed teenager through a neighbourhood for little reason more than he was a black man wearing a hoodie.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin was not minutes old when an outcry was heard over racial injustice and demands for yet another prosecution by the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the verdict, the Zimmerman case entered the realm of legal mythology -- a tale told by different groups in radically different ways for different purposes. Fax machines were activated with solicitations and sound bites programmed for this moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal cases often make for easy and dangerous vehicles for social expression. They allow longstanding social and racial issues to be personified in villains and victims. We simplify facts and characters -- discarding those facts that do not fit our narrative.  Zimmerman and Martin became proxies in our unresolved national debate over race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have condemned this jury and some even called for the six jurors to be killed or demanded that they &quot;kill themselves.&quot; The fact is that this jury had little choice given the case presented by the prosecutors. This is why I predicted full acquittal before the case even went to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the case is lost forever to the artistic license of social commentary, it is worth considering what the jurors were given, or not given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State attorney's misstep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem began at the start. Many of us criticized State Attorney Angela Corey for overcharging the case as second-degree murder. While Corey publicly proclaimed that she was above public pressure, her prosecution decisions suggested otherwise. Investigators interviewed a key witness at the Martin home in the presence of the family -- a highly irregular practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to push the second-degree murder charge (while satisfying many in the public) was legally and tactically unwise. The facts simply did not support a claim beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman acted with intent and a &quot;depraved mind, hatred, malice, evil intent or ill will.&quot; Had Corey charged manslaughter, the case might have turned out differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutors then made that bad decision of charges worse by overplaying their evidence to overcome the testimony of their own witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the prosecution inexplicably decided to lead the case with testimony of Martin's friend Rachel Jeantel. Jeantel was a disaster, admitting to lying previously under oath and giving conflicted testimony. She also stated that just as Zimmerman was accused of calling Martin a derogatory name, Martin called Zimmerman a &quot;cracker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's zeal for conviction seemed to blind it to the actual strengths and weakness of the case. It also led to allegations of withholding key evidence from the defense to deny its use at trial, though Judge Debra Nelson seemed to struggle to ignore the alleged misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some questions unanswered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, we had no better an idea of what happened that night at the end of this trial than we had at the end of that fateful night. Jurors don't make social judgment or guesses on verdicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many have criticized Zimmerman for following Martin, citizens are allowed to follow people in their neighborhood. It was also lawful for Zimmerman to be armed. The question comes down to who started the fight and whether Zimmerman was acting in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various witnesses said Martin was on top of Zimmerman and said they believed that he was the man calling for help. Zimmerman had injuries. Not serious injuries but injuries from the struggle. Does that mean that he was clearly the victim? No. It does create added doubt on the use of lethal force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror could not simply assume Zimmerman was the aggressor. After 38 prosecution witnesses, there was nothing more than a call for the jury to assume the worst facts against Zimmerman without any objective piece of evidence. That is the opposite of the standard of a presumption of innocence in a criminal trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even for manslaughter, the jury was told that Zimmerman was justified in the use of force if he feared &quot;great bodily harm.&quot; That brought the jury back to the question of how the fight unfolded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal does not even mean that the jurors liked Zimmerman or his actions. It does not even mean they believed Zimmerman. It means that they could not convict a man based on a presumption of guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, little of this matters in the wake of a high-profile case. The case and its characters long ago took on the qualities of legend. A legend is defined as &quot;a traditional story sometimes popularly regarded as historical but unauthenticated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People will make what they will of the murder trial of Zimmerman. However, this jury proved that the justice system remains a matter not of legend but law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's business with the criminal court in Florida may be done, but a federal civil rights investigation remains open, and legal experts say he could face a civil suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal investigation into the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is underway, and prosecutors from the Justice Department's civil rights division will review evidence from the FBI and the Florida trial, the Justice Department said Sunday in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated townhouse community in Sanford, Fla., shot and killed Trayvon on Feb. 26, 2012, as Trayvon returned home from buying snacks at a convenience store. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claimed he shot the unarmed African-American teenager in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate,&quot; the Justice statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Ben Jealous said on CNN that the civil rights organization had spoken with Justice Department officials about lodging federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be a federal civil rights phase,&quot; Jealous said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's family could sue Zimmerman in civil court for wrongful death, following the example of the families of O.J. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. The families sued the football star and won $33.5million after he was acquitted on murder charges. A wrongful death lawsuit seeks money damages rather than punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., issued a statement urging the family to sue Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While I am profoundly disappointed with the ruling in this case, the criminal portion of the process has run its course,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;I encourage Trayvon's parents to pursue vindication of their rights under civil law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the verdict a &quot;tragic miscarriage of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter how you look at this situation, if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still be alive with his family today,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;Yet there is still the potential for justice to be served through a civil suit brought about by Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's surviving family members, and also through civil rights charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zimmerman has few assets, a book or movie deal could make him a lucrative target for a wrongful death suit, said Randy Reep, a criminal defense attorney in Jacksonville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from money, the family might sue &quot;if only for a victory in principle,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the acquittal in criminal court, Trayvon's parents could win in civil court, where a lower standard of proof prevails, he said. A jury in civil court need only be convinced that Zimmerman &quot;more likely than not&quot; is responsible for Trayvon's wrongful death, he said. In a criminal court, a jury can acquit if they have &quot;reasonable doubt.&quot; Zimmerman would be immune to such a lawsuit only if he asked for a hearing under Florida's &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; law and a judge found he justifiably used force in self-defense in the face of an &quot;unlawful threat,&quot; Reep said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, spoke Saturday night on the possibility of suits against his client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the civil aspect, if someone believes that it's appropriate to sue George Zimmerman, then we will seek and we will get immunity in a civil hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll see just how many civil lawsuits are spawned from this fiasco.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first word out of Los Angeles Clippers forward Matt Barnes' mouth: frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was his immediate reaction to the not guilty verdict for George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just shows that youth these days, no matter what your race, you hear day in, day out about people getting gunned down, and now you have to worry about this kind of stuff,&quot; Barnes told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview. &quot;The streets aren't always safe. Whether Zimmerman got beat up or not, the point is, he was supposed to be in the car and let the police handle it. He didn't do that, and a 17-year-old kid is dead because of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barnes also was among several pro athletes who went on Twitter to express their thoughts on the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade tweeted, &quot;Wow!!! Stunned!!! Saddened as a father!!! Some1 make sense of this verdict for me right now please!!! Don't worry I'll wait...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He followed that with, &quot;How do I explain this to my young boys????&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade was among members of the Heat who gathered for a group photo wearing hoodies in March 2012, shortly after Martin was killed. Then, Heat star LeBron James tweeted the photo with the words &quot;#WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former NFL linebacker Scott Fujita said on Twitter: &quot;Who really failed here? The prosecution? The jury? No. The laws in the state of FL failed. Be constructive in response. Focus on change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some players did not think justice was served when the verdict was announced Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The more things change, the more they stay the same. #RipTrayvonMartin,&quot; Clippers guard Jamal Crawford wrote in a tweet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America  justice system is a joke,&quot; Oklahoma City Thunder center Kendrick Perkins tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Watched a lot of the case...(thought) manslaughter was a definite! Thinking about everyone involved especially the Martin family,&quot; Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not guilty!!! Wow!!!&quot; new Clippers guard-forward Jared Dudley said on Twitter. &quot;Between Casey Anthony and Zimmerman the state of Florida is looking real bad!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Instagram, New York Knicks guard J.R. Smith posted a photo of himself with his daughter and wrote, &quot;Hearts an Prayers go out to T.Martin an his PARENTS!! Still wearing my HOOD n bout to take my baby to get an ice tea n skittles!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Players also tweeted support for Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My Heart goes out to the Martin Family! Keep the Faith! #God is in control, He's the one and only Judge!&quot; Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta Falcons receiver Roddy White apologized after this tweet in the immediate aftermath of the verdict: &quot;All them jurors should go home tonight and kill themselves for letting a grown man get away with killing a kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White followed: &quot;I understand my tweet last nite was extreme. I never meant for the people to do that. I was shocked and upset about the verdict. I am sorry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barnes spoke just before getting on a plane in Boston to head home to Los Angeles. Even after hanging up, he had more to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't know where this situation goes from here, but if there is another trial I'd love to team up with athletes who have the same views as I do and help pay for the Martin family to have the absolute best representation possible,&quot; Barnes said in a text message.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sanford, fla. George Zimmerman is a relieved man in hiding. Those convinced of his guilt in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin continue to protest his acquittal and other perceived injustices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the trial is over, some people are counseling that it's time to heal and move on. But protests were held across the country Sunday by people who say they can't move on while they feel that the case and the bigger issues of race and justice that it represents are unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a jury of six women found Zimmerman not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the conflicting feelings of all those involved hung in the air of the courtroom like heavy fog. Now the question is what those feelings mean for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year people were very angry, and they came to Sanford to protest because George Zimmerman had not been arrested,&quot; said Norton Bonaparte, Sanford's city manager. &quot;Now he has been arrested. He's been through the trial and a jury has found him not guilty. That's the American judicial system, and from that we move forward.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This central Florida city of more than 50,000 people drew little national attention before Feb. 26, 2012 -- the night neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, encountered black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on a quiet street in a gated community here, some 20 miles northeast of Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, Trayvon, 17, was dead of a gunshot wound. Months later, Sanford and Zimmerman, 29, remained the focus of national protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night and Sunday, there were more demonstrators in Sanford. Most condemned the verdict. Some praised it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued Sunday, President Obama called Trayvon's death a tragedy for America but made no mention of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; Obama said, &quot;but we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for calm and national introspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities,&quot; he said. &quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after the verdict, Fort Mellon Park, the scene of protests calling for Zimmerman's arrest, was quiet. In Goldsboro, a black neighborhood in Sanford, people stood outside well past midnight discussing what to do next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francis Oliver, curator of the Goldsboro Museum, had begun pushing for Trayvon's killer to be arrested the day after the shooting. In her office, she has photos of other young black men killed in Sanford. She says she will enhance her civil engagement by talking to young men about their safety and the danger of being profiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't depend on the system to protect our children,&quot; she said. &quot;When they found Zimmerman not guilty, they also found profiling of black boys not guilty, stereotyping of young black men not guilty, stand your ground against young black men not guilty. We as mothers are going to have to tell them you put on a hoodie, you could be profiled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver noted that citizen action has had results in Sanford: Zimmerman was arrested. Former police chief Bill Lee was fired. The new chief, Cecil Smith, has begun sending officers to meet people in their neighborhoods to build trust. She hopes people will continue to attend community meetings and hold leaders accountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some area pastors, preaching love and helping people deal with their feelings is important. The Rev. Venitta Robinson delivered a sermon about God's love at Allen Chapel AME Church in Sanford shortly after her pastor, Valarie Houston, spoke about being hurt by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The service helped you not to hold onto the anguish, not to hold onto the hurt and the pain,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;You were able to release it knowing that God is in control of everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are hoping to continue the dialogue, continue the conversation and continue the direct action against the system that killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; said Dave Schneider, an organizer with the Coalition for Justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, outside the courthouse where the verdict was read, about 25 demonstrators held signs in support of Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Landau, 24, of Denver, was one of them. Landau, who said he is a social justice advocate, public speaker and poet, said he and others will continue rallies across the country to help people remember Trayvon and what Landau said was a miscarriage of justice in the teen's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way we prevent future occurrences is raising awareness and getting people more involved,&quot; he said. &quot;There is too much voice and there's not enough action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon may become a modern touchstone for lingering racial discord in the United States nearly 50 years after Martin Luther King delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech at the March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Trayvon's family, said the teen's death and his killer's acquittal will go down in history with the assassination in 1963 of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, whose murder trial twice ended in a hung jury, and the murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was killed in 1955 after reportedly whistling at a white woman, &quot;as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've gone back to a time that we had hoped that our country had gotten past,&quot; said Judith Browne Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C., that advocates for racial equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanford University professor Claybourne Carson, who is teaching a course this summer on Martin Luther King, said the case has nothing to do with civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an important case in terms of how we view the right of citizens to police their neighborhoods in a way that can lead to wrongful death (but less clear is whether) we should be seeing (the verdict) as a major setback in race relations,&quot; Carson said. &quot;I asked the same question about the O.J. Simpson trial. It was a trial in which a lot of light was shed on something that was not representative of very much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal is a wake-up call for African-American youth, said Roslyn Brock, chairwoman of the NAACP, who said she spent Sunday trying to &quot;calm the fear and anxieties and the hurt and the pain&quot; of more than 1,000 black youth gathered in Orlando for the organization's annual convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a pivotal moment in the life of this generation,&quot; she said. &quot;They can't process how can you be walking home from a store and end up dead, and how six women, five mothers, can't find it within the justice system to see that a life has been taken, that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life had value.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be difficult to predict whether the energy after the trial will be sustained beyond the outrage, whether it becomes an inspirational moment for a generation of African-American young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman verdict came just weeks after the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, and just weeks before the 50th anniversary of King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent interview with USA TODAY, the Rev. Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King and head of the King Center in Atlanta, said that ruling presents a critical moment -- and an opportunity -- for young African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the generation that is dangerously close to not making their contribution to the freedom struggle,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, protesters who would argue they are ready to contribute said the message of the verdict was simple:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young African Americans are not safe in their native land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reconfirms everything I already knew, but we wanted to think that there was at least a little bit of an improvement,&quot; said Shan Holder, 22. &quot;But when we saw 'not guilty' come across the television screen, we were like, 'Really? Really?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a social moment when we have the responsibility and the opportunity to take a stand and make an impact. We want to direct this energy. We want to impact legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Zimmerman verdict taps into a deep vein of distrust</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 8A</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many who closely followed the trial of George Zimmerman, the verdict of not guilty spurred fury, heartache and, by Sunday, protests across the country.  But the outcome should not have come as a surprise.  Zimmerman's attorneys managed to undermine the prosecution's narrative that their client was the aggressor who followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and killed him with no justification.  And the prosecution -- which had the burden of proof -- was unable to effectively refute Zimmerman's story of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But somewhere between Martin's death 17 months ago in a gated community near Orlando and Saturday night's verdict, the story line that matters the most largely got lost. It's a tragically familiar  tale of snap judgments by strangers, racial profiling and a black teenager's needless death. And it's the reason the trial attracted national attention and gavel-to-gavel coverage in the first place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict deserves to be respected and, as President Obama said Sunday, it should also serve as a reason  for calm reflection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's successful defense depended on getting jurors to focus on the fight that occurred just before he shot the 17-year-old, unarmed Martin, and not on the events that preceded it. The lawyers established doubt about which man screamed for help, as well as other details of the confrontation -- holes that invited an acquittal under Florida's laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fact remains that Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer and cop wanna-be, instantly identified Martin as a &quot;(expletive) punk&quot; who &quot;looks like he's up to no good.&quot; The fact remains that Martin was doing nothing wrong; he was returning from a snack run at a convenience store, heading for the house of his father's girlfriend. And the fact remains that had Zimmerman stayed in his truck, as advised by the police, Martin would be alive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those facts -- and the authorities' initial failure to charge Zimmerman -- inflamed the black community. African Americans saw the case in a way that the jury of six women, five of them white and the other of uncertain ethnicity, probably couldn't. Despite all the nation's progress in burying its racist past, minorities are commonly stopped by authorities -- or viewed by strangers as &quot;up to no good&quot; -- for no other reason than the color of their skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider New York City's &quot;stop and frisk&quot; policy, which allows officers to search anyone they see as suspicious: In 2011, 87% of those stopped were minorities. Or the shooting of three black men who did nothing more than venture into a white New Orleans community days after Hurricane Katrina. Or try to find an African-American man who hasn't been stopped for &quot;driving while black&quot; or eyed suspiciously in a department store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said Sunday it will weigh criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, as urged by the NAACP and others. That course would be satisfying on one level, presumably addressing the actions that led to the fight. But it's no slam dunk. It raises fairness issues, and the case is too narrow to serve as an instrument for righting the racial inequities of the justice system, so long in need of attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's fate was determined as it should have been, based on the evidence in a court of law, not the court of public opinion. But just because a verdict is legally justified doesn't make it morally satisfying. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death remains an avoidable American tragedy -- one that Zimmerman set in motion. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 8A</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">463 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beth Kassab, Orlando Sentinel: &quot;Like it or not, the jury got this one right. Nobody wants to see two parents who already lost their teenage son also lose out on what they saw as justice. As painful as it may be, though, acquitting George Zimmerman was the only verdict the jury could logically reach. The state simply didn't prove second-degree murder. Or manslaughter. As much as I don't like many of the choices Zimmerman made the night he killed Trayvon Martin, the evidence presented at trial gave way to more than one reasonable doubt about Zimmerman's guilt.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Henderson, Detroit Free Press: &quot;What do I make of this for my 9-year-old son? A little brown-skinned boy who sometimes wears a hoodie, and who someday might be walking home from the store with a pack of Skittles. Life is dangerous for black children, we all know that. And frankly, my most primal fear for my son, growing up in Detroit, is that he'll become the victim of the senseless violence that African-American children and adults rain down on each other all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Lott, Fox News: &quot;The George Zimmerman case should never have been brought. Saturday night after the 'not guilty' verdict was delivered, State Attorney Angela Corey justified bringing the case 'to put the facts out there.' But criminal cases should never be brought simply to put the facts before the public. No one should be charged with a crime unless prosecutors themselves really believe that the person committed a crime. Yet, the prosecution and their own experts' language consistently showed a lack of certainty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ta-Nehisi Coates, The Atlantic: &quot;The message of this episode is unfortunate. By Florida law, in any violent confrontation ending in a disputed act of lethal self-defense, without eye witnesses, the advantage goes to the living. An intelligent, self-interested observer of this case, who happens to live in Florida, would not be wrong to do as Zimmerman did -- buy a gun, master the finer points of Florida self-defense law and then wait.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jelani Cobb, The New Yorker: &quot;The familiarity dulled the sharp edges of the tragedy. The decision the six jurors reached on Saturday evening will inspire anger, frustration and despair, but little surprise, and this is the most deeply saddening aspect of the entire affair. From the outset -- throughout the 44 days it took for there to be an arrest, and then in the 16 months it took to for the case to come to trial -- there was a nagging suspicion that it would culminate in disappointment. Call this historical profiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Benjamin, Salon: &quot;Even before the verdict, the Police Establishment warned black people not to riot. ... The chase, the trial, the warnings not to riot, the acquittal all compound the passive-aggressive profiling of black and brown people.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At what point do we stop playing the race card every time a black person does not get what the NAACP feels is the right decision?  Does the NAACP realize that constantly bringing it up simply promotes further racism? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is our legal system. This is what we have to work with. Six jurors  analyzed the evidence. Who are we to second-guess what was presented in court? Who are we to say justice was or was not served? Did you sit on the jury? Were you sitting in the courtroom? No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Callery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't call it playing the race card.  This trial is about race in the way the justice system handled the situation. We have a country based on being judged by peers. For the jury to be realistically made up of peers,  there should have been a black mother on it, at least one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the outrage is that this happens daily. Blacks are convicted in similar scenarios: A black guy hits another black guy; they fight, and one feels threatened and shoots. The shooter gets convicted, but not in this case; that's the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrecia Smith</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdicts aren't meant to placate. We must accept that this jury reached its decision because jurors believed Zimmerman was in fear of his own life when he shot Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ron Harris</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman should have been held accountable in some manner for his actions. Had the prosecution pursued manslaughter charges at the beginning, instead of second-degree murder, perhaps a different verdict would have been reached. The prosecution botched this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 2A</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">817 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's complicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life is packed with nuances and subtleties and shades of gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the news media are often uncomfortable in such murky terrain. They prefer straightforward narratives, with good guys and bad guys, heroes and villains. Those tales are much easier for readers and viewers to relate to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of their tragic confrontation on Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, Fla., was framed early on. Zimmerman, then 28, was the neighborhood watch captain/&quot;wannabe cop&quot; who racially profiled and ultimately killed Trayvon, an unarmed, hoodie-clad black teenager out on the streets of the gated community Retreat at Twin Lakes simply because he wanted some Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The storyline quickly took root, amplified by the nearly ubiquitous images of the two: a sweet-looking photo of a several-years-younger Trayvon released by his family and a mug shot of Zimmerman from a previous arrest in which he looks puffy and downcast. The contrasting images powerfully reinforced the images of the menacing bully and the innocent victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the media's major mistakes stemmed from stories that fit neatly into that widely accepted narrative. NBC News edited Zimmerman's comments during a phone call to inaccurately suggest that he volunteered that Trayvon seemed suspicious because he was black. In fact, Zimmerman was responding to a question when he mentioned the teenager's race. The network apologized for the error. Similarly, ABC News broadcast a story reporting that a police surveillance video showed no evidence that Zimmerman had suffered abrasions or had bled during the confrontation with Trayvon. Shortly thereafter, it &quot;clarified&quot; the situation, reporting that an enhanced version of the video showed Zimmerman with &quot;an injury to the back of his head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it emerged that Zimmerman's mother was Peruvian, some news outlets took to referring to him with the rarely used phrase &quot;white Hispanic,&quot; which is kind of like calling President Obama &quot;white black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lawyer, was brutal in his post-acquittal comments about the press's treatment of his client. Hard to blame him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Sanford police originally declined to prosecute Zimmerman, State Attorney Angela Corey charged him with second-degree murder in the wake of the flurry of news coverage, street protests and a powerful campaign on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was much more to the story, as the obvious weakness of the prosecution's case against Zimmerman and the jury's not-guilty verdict make abundantly clear. There was evidence that Zimmerman decidedly got the worst of it during the struggle before he shot Trayvon. Trayvon was an athletic, 6'1&quot; 17-year-old, not necessarily a helpless victim. Zimmerman may well have been acting in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is hardly to suggest that Zimmerman is a candidate for canonization. This is on him. It was his reckless behavior that set this tragedy in motion. If he had stayed in his vehicle as the police told him to do, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would be alive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As more details emerged, so, too, did a fuller picture of the events of Feb. 26, 2012. But by then the popular view of what had happened had hardened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives see this episode as yet another manifestation of the pervasive bias of that dreaded liberal media, but there's something else at play. Journalists are addicted above all else to the good story. And the saga of the bigoted, frustrated would-be law enforcement officer gunning down the helpless child was too good to check. It's also another example of how groupthink can shape news coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A healthy dose of skepticism should always be part of the journalism process. And in this case, there was a particularly strong reason for caution. Although some residents of the complex saw some parts of the conflict, only two people knew, really knew, how it went down, and one of them was dead. Under those circumstances, certainty was elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 2006, the nation's media gave huge play to a saga in which three Duke University lacrosse players were charged with raping a stripper at a team party. But the case collapsed, the prosecutor was disbarred, and many news organizations looked seriously foolish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what had gone wrong by journalist Rachel Smolkin for a reconstruction of the episode in American Journalism Review, Daniel Okrent, a former New York Times public editor, responded, &quot;It was too delicious a story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound familiar?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Duke lacrosse fiasco also provides some hopeful guidance for the media in dealing with the next Trayvon&nbsp;Martin/George Zimmerman story. Well before the case imploded, Stuart Taylor of National Journal and Joe Neff of the News &amp; Observer in Raleigh did topnotch, against the grain reporting poking holes in the prosecution's overwrought version of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope we see much, much more of that the next time the news media encounter a story that's &quot;too delicious.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said in a statement in which he referred to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot; Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges - a verdict that stunned the black community and civil rights groups and spurred largely peaceful protests in the streets in several U.S. cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women accepted that Zimmerman had acted in self-defence when he shot and killed Martin as the teenager walked to his father's house in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., near Orlando, in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot; A fight ensured during which he shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were at the heart of the campaign for justice for their son, chose not to be in court on Saturday evening and spent Sunday morning in church. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said on Twitter: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; - a reference to the Latin phrase &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; known as an expression of betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case. The department launched a probe a year ago but stepped aside to allow Florida's prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents are also considering a wrongful-death civil suit against Zimmerman. Sixteen years ago, O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay $25 million in compensation to Nicole Brown Simpson's family members despite his infamous acquittal in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was walking to his father's house carrying a can of iced tea and a box of Skittles when he was gunned down by Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman claimed he shot the boy in selfdefence when Martin began beating him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a country still smarting from a painful history of slavery and segregation, many blacks saw overt racism in Zimmerman's focus on a black boy wearing a hoodie as he walked through a gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, many argued this weekend, proves the criminal justice system is still inherently biased against black people given Martin, the unarmed slaying victim, was successfully portrayed as the aggressor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country,&quot; said Al Sharpton, the Baptist minister and civil rights activist who helped to draw attention to the case after police initially released Zimmerman without charge. &quot;What this jury has done is establish a precedent that when you are young and fit a certain profile, you can be committing no crime, just bringing some Skittles and iced tea home to your brother, and be killed and someone can claim selfdefence. I think that this is an atrocity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat now running for New York City comptroller, called the verdict a &quot;failure of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The judicial system is not perfect. And in this case it has failed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- As downtown property owners cleaned up storefronts damaged in a chaotic overnight protest, demonstrations were held Sunday afternoon in Oakland and San Francisco to condemn the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a late-afternoon march, which started at Frank Ogawa Plaza in downtown Oakland, hundreds of protesters traversed some four-to-five miles and circled back to 14th Street and Broadway where they sat down about 7 p.m., blocking the intersection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marchers had been on the move for more than two hours, with police monitoring the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of 8 p.m., no arrests had been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rest in peace Trayvon&nbsp;Martin; Rest in peace Alan Blueford; Rest in peace Oscar Grant. End the violence,&quot; shouted Sellassi Blackwell, 30, of San Francisco, as a crowd before him cheered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all Trayvon,&quot; said Reiko Redmonde, who organized the Bay Area protests. &quot;This is not just a question for black youth but for all peoples' humanity, a question of what kind of society and what kind of world we want to live in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests had been planned in East Oakland at 73rd Avenue and International Boulevard, and also at 14th Street and Broadway in Oakland and Powell and Market streets in San Francisco. They are part of protests nationwide, with rallies Sunday in Florida, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, Fresno, Cleveland, and Los Angeles, where a demonstration turned violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, people walked onto Interstate 10 by the Crenshaw Avenue exit and clashed with police. At a nearby street corner a crowd threw rocks and batteries at officers, who fired beanbag rounds. There were no arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bay Area demonstrations came after a march that began Saturday, hours after a jury acquitted Zimmerman in a Florida courtroom. At 12:30 a.m. Sunday, Oakland protesters knocked trash cans into the street and sometimes set the contents alight, creating small fires amid cheers from onlookers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man was being beaten by multiple attackers in a Broadway doorway near Frank Ogawa Plaza until other protesters surrounded the skirmish and yelled at the combatants to stop. The man was helped to his feet and did not appear to be seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 12:45 a.m., demonstrators remained in the area around 19th and Telegraph but numbers had significantly diminished. Some shouted that police were trying to &quot;kettle&quot; them, or corral them into a limited area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday morning, property owners were boarding up storefronts and cleaning graffiti, but broken glass remained on sidewalks along Telegraph Avenue and Broadway, the two thoroughfares that bore the brunt of the vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the businesses damaged were Sears, the Oakland Tribune, and Flora, a restaurant in the 1900 block of Telegraph Avenue that was nevertheless busy during the lunch hour Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said, &quot;a small group of people gathered in downtown Oakland last night. Sadly, some of them dishonored the memory of Trayvon by engaging in violent activities that hurt our growing economy and endangered people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unacceptable as well. We will not tolerate violence in our city. We must come together to heal and move forward,&quot; Quan said. &quot;In the days and weeks ahead our community will continue working to learn from this tragedy and to prevent this from ever happening again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Fla. man freed in Martin killing&quot; [front page, July 14]: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are the jury and the judicial system in the George Zimmerman case now being convicted? A jury has to navigate difficult waters between what the law requires for conviction and the case evidence. The initial perpetrator in this case is obvious. Wouldn't anyone be concerned if someone simply began following him for no justifiable reason?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Trayvon&nbsp;Martin have a right to &quot;stand his ground&quot; under Florida law in the confrontation with Mr. Zimmerman? Was that his fatal mistake? Should he simply have run? If he had run, how would he know that he wasn't still being followed? Many questions still are unanswered. And, perhaps, there's too little factual evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury should be accorded respect in this matter because it is often between a rock and a hard place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fritz Joseph Orzelek, Binghamton, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state of  Florida charged George Zimmerman with second-degree murder, even though most experts believed the state didn't have sufficient evidence to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that Mr. Zimmerman committed second-degree murder. That's the charge the state brought against him; that's what the state prosecuted him for; and that's what his lawyers defended him against. The state didn't charge him with manslaughter, and his lawyers didn't defend him against a manslaughter charge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the state presented its case, and after Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers defended him against the charge of second-degree murder, but before the jury was sent to decide his guilt or innocence, the state effectively admitted that it hadn't proved Mr. Zimmerman had committed second-degree murder and so it asked the judge to add manslaughter to the charges. Shockingly, she did.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury agreed unanimously that the state failed to prove that Mr. Zimmerman committed second-degree murder and, hopefully, it didn't waste any time trying to decide whether he committed a crime (manslaughter) he wasn't charged with committing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Scanlon, Ellicott City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of being grateful that his client has gotten away with gunning down an unarmed teenager, Don West, George Zimmerman's defense lawyer, complained, &quot;The prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful.&quot; I hope Mr. West uses part of his fee to purchase a new dictionary, since he apparently doesn't know the meaning of that term. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also hope he never again inflicts such a despicable, callous comment on those who mourn for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and grieve with his family.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some pastors cited the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan, others the one about the suspicious strangers who spoke in tongues. Some took sides, others didn't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in many Washington-area pulpits Sunday, clergy helping congregants through George Zimmerman's controversial acquittal shared a message: Ultimate justice lies with God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know some see it this way, and some see it that way, but you know God knows,&quot; Pastor James E. Jordan Jr. said from the pulpit at Refreshing Spring Church of God in Christ in Riverdale, his eyes squeezed shut in prayer. The middle-aged, African American congregation shouted in affirmation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling came late Saturday, meaning many pastors had to ditch their prepared sermons. They responded in various ways, from delivering their words in hoodies to not mentioning the case at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late morning sermon at 10,000-member Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church in Fort Washington was more of a long healing service than an exploration of the nuts and bolts of the case, which saw Zimmerman accused of murdering unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The altar call, a period during Christian services when some come before the pulpit to reaffirm their faith, went on an unusually long time, with one young black man after another approaching to seek prayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Floyd Williamson, minister of Silver Spring Church of Christ, had not planned to preach about the verdict in the pulpit, but he did quote from Mark 12:30 because &quot;most of the congregation had it on their minds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Mark 12 Jesus said the greatest commandment is to love the Lord with all your heart and with all your soul and to love your neighbor as yourself,&quot; Williamson said. &quot;Even though there is injustice, wrong and evil in the world, it can't deter us from our love for God and our neighbors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Howard University, Nikkeishia Parmely clasped her daughter's thin shoulders as she chanted, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Sunday evening was warm, Keymiah Parmely, 7, wore a lightweight hoodie - not just a jacket covering her beaded braids, but a now symbol of Martin, the Florida teenager who the Parmelys and hundreds of others had gathered beneath the American flag at the center of Howard University to memorialize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nikkeishia Parmely was angry that Zimmerman was found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It hurt me like I was a member of that family,&quot; she said of the moment she heard the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Sunday, hundreds beneath the bright white dome of Foundry United Methodist Church in Dupont heard Nelson Mandela's prison chaplain, a South African bishop who was in town to give a sermon on hospitality. The Foundry congregation is largely white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The outcome of the trial in Sanford is a troubling thing, because it's exposed our addiction to racial division,&quot; said the Rev. Peter Storey. &quot;We will see what the Holy Spirit does with this painful thing, if it can be turned to God's providence for healing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Storey preached about the biblical story of Jesus's followers speaking in tongues and being laughed at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't hear people when we've been taught they don't matter. We won't hear people who tell us uncomfortable things. Then we have a dialogue of the deaf,&quot; Storey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the church announcements period at All Souls Unitarian in Columbia Heights, the Rev. Cathy Rion Starr, the social justice minister, said many in the congregation were &quot;grieving and full of anger at the injustice of a not guilty verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the call to prayer, Starr said the congregation is &quot;connected to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family . . . we are connected to all those who wage violence on others.&quot; She never mentioned Zimmerman's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Brook Hill United Methodist Church in Yellow Springs, near Frederick, the only mention of the Zimmerman verdict came during the benediction, when the associate pastor, Gary Hicks, prayed that there be peace nationwide in response to the jury's ruling. Congregants could be overheard responding &quot;amen&quot; to the prayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - It's over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's not really done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-guilty verdict that sounded so final, so utterly unequivocal, in Courtroom 5D of the Seminole County courthouse Saturday night has quickly given way to a kaleidoscope of demonstrations across the country, debate about wrongful-death lawsuits and Web-site-crashing demands for the filing of federal civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday night, George Zimmerman was able to shed the GPS device that had monitored his movements before he was acquitted of manslaughter and second-degree murder charges in the death of teenager Trayvon Martin. But the drama over the case persists, and it promises to go on and on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the cramped and rolling nature of this spectacle that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. is scheduled to speak Tuesday in Orlando, just a short drive from the courthouse where the verdict was read. He will address the annual convention of an organization - the NAACP - whose leader, Benjamin Jealous, launched a petition late Saturday asking that the Justice Department file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. The petition received such a massive response that it crashed the NAACP Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours of the petition's debut, the Justice Department released a statement saying its civil rights division still had an open investigation into Martin's death, launched more than a year ago. Working with the FBI, federal prosecutors are reviewing evidence gathered during a Justice Department investigation - and revealed during the Seminole County trial - to see whether the case fits within &quot;the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who has a white father and a Peruvian mother, claimed self-defense in the death of Martin, an unarmed African American teenager he saw walking through his modest gated community in February 2012. Zimmerman said he shot Martin after the teenager sucker-punched him and started pounding his head into a concrete walkway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had a concealed-carry permit for the handgun he used that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was racial profiling,&quot; Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in an interview Sunday shortly after arriving in the Orlando area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnwine said that she met with Justice Department officials before Zimmerman's arrest in hopes of persuading them to file civil rights charges and that she would renew the push now that Zimmerman has been acquitted by a six-woman jury with no African American members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But doubts have been expressed by at least one Martin family attorney about the viability of a civil rights charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Washington Post during the trial, lawyer Daryl Parks said: &quot;There was not enough evidence to say that [Zimmerman] made this decision based on race. . . . On the facts of this case, you can't say it was based on race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In closing arguments and in a news conference after the verdict, prosecutors insisted that the trial was not about race. Arnwine criticized prosecutors, including State Attorney Angela Corey, who was appointed by Gov. Rick Scott (R), for taking that approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What did she think it was about?&quot; Arnwine said. &quot;I do think that the case did show that the prosecutors did not have a good strategy for dealing with the racial element.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida defense lawyer Diana Tennis argued in an interview that &quot;if anybody has a civil rights action, it's George Zimmerman.&quot; Tennis said that &quot;black leaders and black lawyers got him maliciously prosecuted&quot; by pressuring local politicians during the month and a half between the shooting and Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, she said, is &quot;the one who might end up in federal court asking a lot of embarrassing questions to a lot of shame-faced politicians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallies - including a large demonstration organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton in Sanford - were held nationwide to protest the initial decision of Sanford police not to charge Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Martin family's lead attorney, Benjamin Crump, who is African American, mounted a successful campaign to generate media interest in the case, with the help of a public relations firm and other lawyers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorneys are poised for the possibility of civil lawsuits against their client. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara has said he will seek immunity for Zimmerman if civil suits &quot;spawned by this fiasco&quot; are filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tennis said the defense pursued a pretrial strategy that seemed designed, at least in part, to avoid any risk of not being able to claim immunity in future civil lawsuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense opted against asking the judge to dismiss the case based on Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which in many cases justifies the use of deadly force, without the obligation to flee, when a person feels threatened. If the judge had refused a dismissal on those grounds, Zimmerman might not have been able to claim immunity later, Tennis said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They took a gambit,&quot; she said. &quot;I think they were looking forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that even though Zimmerman is not wealthy now, he may be able to strike lucrative book deals, generating income that could be at risk in a civil suit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal standard in a civil lawsuit is lower - a preponderance of the evidence, rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Zimmerman chose not to testify in his criminal trial, but it is likely he would have to testify and be deposed in a civil lawsuit, said Daniel Petrocelli, who led the legal team that won $33.5 million in damages in a civil wrongful-death trial against O.J. Simpson after his murder acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In that sense, civil trials are a more pure search for the truth,&quot; Petrocelli, a partner in the O'Melveny &amp; Myers law firm, said in an interview Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrocelli said that his deposition of Simpson lasted 14 days and that he received suggestions from around the world - all of which he ignored - about what questions to ask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnwine said she has met frequently with Martin's family members since they began trying to persuade journalists and public officials to press for an arrest of Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she expects them to explore &quot;all their options,&quot; including possible civil litigation and a push for a civil rights charge, now that Zimmerman has been acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict, she said, is likely to spur more people to attend events in the District related to next month's 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she knows what many of them will be wearing: hoodies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE VERDICT by a Florida jury that George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder or manslaughter in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin settles - pending review by the U.S. Justice Department - the legal question of his criminal culpability. Jurors listened attentively and deliberated carefully, and the rule of law must be respected. But the central tragedy of this case - the death of a 17-year-old boy who had been on a simple errand to get snacks - remains.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have no further business with the court,&quot; the Seminole County judge told Mr. Zimmerman moments after the jury of six women at 9:47 p.m. Saturday delivered the twin verdicts of not guilty to the tense courtroom - and to a national audience attracted by the cable television coverage. Mr. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot Mr. Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, claiming self-defense after he said the teenager knocked him to the ground and hit his head against the sidewalk. Prosecutors had argued that Mr. Zimmerman instigated the confrontation by assuming the youth had no place in the gated Sanford community and was up to no good and then following him against the express advice of police. Mr. Martin, who was unarmed, was walking back to his father's home after going to a store for candy and a soft drink. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never a simple homicide, Mr. Martin's death became the subject of a charged debate about race, criminal profiling and Florida's permissive &quot;stand your ground&quot; gun law. Despite the jury's verdict, those issues are not likely to go away. One reason the death of this boy in a gray hooded sweatshirt so resonated that even the president of the United States felt compelled to comment was that it brought to the surface historic concerns of minority parents about the vulnerability of their sons. The ineptness of Florida authorities in the initial investigation of this death validated that worry and deepened the distrust. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, though, much of the public debate has done grievous disservice to the legitimacy of these issues. Hucksters and political demagogues exploited tragedy - a boy's death, a family's grief, a man's freedom - and created what has become the now all-too-familiar media circus of oversaturation and rush to judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman's attorney called the prosecution &quot;disgraceful.&quot; But we think it was valuable that the case was aired in an open court before a fair-minded judge and decided by a jury that appeared to be careful and take its time. Guilt was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and Mr. Zimmerman is free to resume his life even as his attorney lamented that it &quot;will never be the same.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That also is as it should be. Mr. Zimmerman could have done what police told him to do and stayed in his vehicle. No one would have heard about him - and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been able to get home on that rainy Sunday evening. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did the system work? Was justice served? We like to think of those questions as identical. After all, the point of a criminal justice system is to dispense justice. But with the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murdering Trayvon Martin, the system worked, yet justice fell short. This outcome is simultaneously sad but healthy - sad because a 17-year-old boy is dead and his killer walks free; healthy because the verdict seems justified as a matter of law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an important place for emotion in criminal proceedings, both for mercy and for outrage. But the system cannot function if it consistently elevates emotion over rules.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides, naturally, see the Zimmerman verdict through the lens of their own preconceptions. &quot;This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the Old South,&quot; said NAACP President Benjamin Jealous, invoking the memory of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was killed in 1955 after supposedly flirting with a white woman and whose murderers were acquitted. &quot;Old South justice,&quot; thundered Jesse Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comparison is unfair. No doubt race played a role in Martin's death. Zimmerman likely would not have called the police about a white teenager - even a white teenager wearing a hoodie - walking back from a 7-Eleven. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no evidence that race played a role in Zimmerman's acquittal. If anything, the racial undertones worked against Zimmerman, increasing public pressure on prosecutors to bring the most serious - and, in hindsight, the most difficult to support - charges against him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast the Zimmerman trial with that of Till's murderers. The courtroom was segregated. No hotel would rent rooms to black observers. The local sheriff welcomed black spectators to the courtroom with what was described as a cheerful use of the vilest racial epithet. The New South is not perfect, but it is not the Old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overreaction from the left is mirrored by the overreaction from the right, and without the excuse of being swept away by emotion over a child's unnecessary death. Conservative Roger L. Simon lamented on PJ Media that Zimmerman &quot;will never live a normal life&quot; and described the prosecution as &quot;quite literally, the first American Stalinist 'show trial.'&acirc;[#x20ac][#x160]&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is, quite literally, deranged. Of course no decent person responsible for killing an unarmed teenager could &quot;live a normal life.&quot; And the entire point of &quot;show trials&quot; was that the outcome, unlike Zimmerman's acquittal, was foreordained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us back to the uncomfortable divide between the criminal justice system and justice itself. One way to understand that gap is to think of the episode as a video. The criminal justice system zooms in, and properly so, on one short segment, a snapshot in the larger narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever preceded the fight between the two men, the central question, as a matter of criminal law, was precisely what occurred in the immediate moments before Zimmerman fired the fatal shot. Zimmerman instigated the tragic chain of events, but legally that was not relevant. To convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, prosecutors had to prove that he did something that he knew was &quot;reasonably certain&quot; to kill or seriously injure and acted with &quot;ill will, hatred, spite or an evil intent.&quot;  Even for the lesser charge of manslaughter, they had to rebut his claim of self-defense, showing that he could not &quot;reasonably believe&quot; shooting Martin was &quot;necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice takes the longer time frame. Zimmerman may not be legally responsible for Martin's death but he remains morally culpable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way to understand the divide is through the prism of legal rules, which may serve the broader ends of justice but produce unjust results in the short run. Thus the exclusionary rule for illegally seized evidence, meaning that some criminals go free because the constable has blundered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, the law's requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal convictions presumes tolerance for a certain amount of unjust results. We accept the bargain, in Blackstone's formulation, that it is &quot;better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal is not the end of this sad story. Because of the lower burden of proof, a civil lawsuit by Martin's family would have a better chance of success. A federal prosecution on civil rights charges would be a mistake; the state trial failed to show adequate evidence of racial animus to sustain such a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, society must accept that there is not always a perfect fit between a criminal justice system and justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a parent's worst nightmare: a child trying to get home on a rainy night, &quot;minding his own business,&quot; walking from the store with Skittles candy, when a stranger stalks him and then kills him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That child had every right to be where he was,&quot; John Guy, a prosecutor in the case against George Zimmerman, had argued to the jury. &quot;That child had every right to do what he was doing, walking home. That child had every right to be afraid of a strange man following him, first in his car and then on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And did that child not have the right to defend himself from that strange man?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a question many parents wrestled with Sunday, the day after a jury in Sanford, Fla., acquitted Zimmerman of killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm numb,&quot; said Walter Kirkland, president of 100 Black Men of Prince George's County, a nonprofit mentorship organization. &quot;Who knows what happened that night? I have two sons, 17 and 12. Martin was just 17, and this is a grown man with a gun, trying to be more than what he is, a want-to-be cop. He took the law into his hands, and he should not have done that. If he had stayed in the car, maybe the boy would be alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict fueled an emotional response in the Washington area. Some parents clicked off the television, unable to listen to more of the chatter. Some mothers choked up, saying Martin looked like their own child. Others compared the killing to other cases in the country's history in which a young black boy goes out at night and is slain. They wondered why the case had been highlighted when the number of black boys killed by black boys has escalated. People sat at dining room tables, talked late into the night, wrestling with the verdict and what it means in a broader society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a hard morning,&quot; said Jessica Care Moore, 41, who has a 6-year-old son and an 18-year-old stepson. &quot;I didn't sleep last night. I cried. I cried. I was physically sick about it. In my head I had somehow figured they [the jurors] would at least give him manslaughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore, a poet and author who works as a youth advocate, said the verdict was debilitating. She tried to figure out what to tell her students. &quot;To do this work, to get youth to think their voice matters, that they can wear what they want to and they don't have to be afraid to be who they are,&quot; Moore said. &quot;How do you go back and explain to them their life has worth and that the judicial system believes their lives are important?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have young black boys thinking they cannot walk through their neighborhoods with hoodies on, walking the way they want to walk, listening to their music - that they can't exert that energy without being murdered and the person gets to go home after that? I'm devastated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. Ethelbert Miller, director of the African American Resource Center at Howard University, wondered what the verdict says about the value of a black boy's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is very important to think about the loss of life,&quot; Miller said. &quot;There is outrage this could happen to so many other young people. And the loss of life means nothing. He got nothing. That is where you have the anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think anybody who has a child and your child is out somewhere, you want your child to come home safe. Trayvon did not come home safe. There is a loss of life, and nobody will pay for this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazi Mutafa, 35, a nonprofit manager, was at home in Columbia Heights when he heard the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his immediate reaction was to recall a line of poetry he had recently heard in a conference: &quot;The length of black life is treated with short worth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutafa said he felt a sense of frustration and disbelief. &quot;The idea that a child would come to visit you and go to the store to get a snack and not come home,&quot; Mutafa said, &quot;if I was a parent, that would be the worst nightmare. . . . That is pretty horrible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the challenge, Mutafa said, is many people in this country cannot empathize with the pain of Martin's parents. &quot;All they see is someone who looks like someone on the news, and not someone who could be a co-worker, a neighbor or a friend,&quot; Mutafa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People are upset that people couldn't put themselves in the shoes of a parent and couldn't see the humanity and know what it is like to be a mother who lost a son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case raised questions about the legal system, social justice and racial profiling of young black men who are often considered suspect, who don't get the benefit of the doubt because of the way they look or dress. &quot;For some people, a black man late at night is suspicious. You could go in a store and shop in a three-piece suit and still be considered suspicious. But you can't leave your skin,&quot; Miller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller said black parents often try to instruct their children to avoid danger. &quot;I raised my kid that you must know how to carry yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case, Miller said, may be another teachable moment. &quot;Racism will not disappear. You struggle with it. There will be victories and setbacks. How you live your life every day will determine your character. That is what life is about. It is not easy. If you are blessed to have children take care of you at an old age, you are blessed. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chase Kirkland, 17 a junior at Bowie High School, said he believes the case should not have been about race. &quot;It should've been about an innocent boy being killed,&quot; Chase said, &quot;You can't make it all about race because Zimmerman is a minority, too.&quot; Zimmerman's mother is Peruvian. His father is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The image of a black boy in a hoodie may become a defining image for a younger generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a conference in Northwest Washington focusing on the art of social change, the poet Moore spoke on a panel with the poet Sonia Sanchez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a moment of silence,&quot; Moore said. &quot;There was a lot of crying during our talk. There was pain. People talked about Trayvon, they talked about being moms. Moms love their babies hard. When someone loses a child, we feel it. . . . Everyone was devastated at the same time. If you could hear the sound of thousands of hearts falling at the same time . . . when we got the news, you could feel it. It is like someone took the breath away.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Statement by the president</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Trial recap</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 24: The trial began with opening statements by the prosecution and the defense. The prosecution repeated obscenities George Zimmerman used in a conversation with a police dispatcher the night Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed. The defense opened with a knock-knock joke about the difficult jury selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 27: Rachel Jeantel continued her testimony about the phone conversation she had with Martin on the night he died. Jeantel said she believes the encounter between Martin and Zimmerman was racially charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 28: A police officer and two neighbors of Zimmerman took the witness stand, giving accounts that supported the prosecution's contention that Zimmerman was being straddled by Martin during the confrontation. The reports conflicted with earlier testimony from other neighbors who portrayed Zimmerman as the aggressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 5: Prosecutors rested their case at the end of the trial's second week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday: A gunshot wound expert hired by the defense testified that Zimmerman's account that Martin was on top of him when he shot and killed the unarmed teenager is consistent with forensic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday: The defense rested its case Wednesday afternoon, and Zimmerman said he would not testify his own trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday: Prosecutors finished their closing arguments, asserting that Zimmerman was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who profiled an unarmed Martin based on &quot;incorrect assumptions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday: At 2:30 p.m., jurors began deliberating whether Zimmerman was guilty of second-degree murder. They could also consider the lesser offense of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday: At 9:47 p.m., court officials announced there was a verdict. Shortly after, the jury acquitted Zimmerman of charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal Saturday night on all charges in the killing of a black teenager, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, sparked deep emotional reactions across the country Sunday, resurrecting an intense national debate about the role of race and racism in American life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama declared Martin's killing an American tragedy but called for calm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From church pews to street corners to the sprawling social-media universe, Americans expressed outrage, disgust and, in some cases, relief at the verdict. Rallies and vigils were held in Washington, San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles as well as in Sanford, Fla., where the killing and the trial took place. Others were scheduled in Boston, Detroit and Baltimore. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I grew up in Georgia, and what happened to Trayvon would be the norm for any black man in Georgia,&quot; said James Ealey, 73, recalling an earlier, more segregated nation. &quot;That was the way it was. We are going backwards. We are not in a post-racial America just because of Barack Obama,&quot; he said after Sunday services at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House issued a statement in which Obama characterized Martin's death as &quot;a tragedy . . . not just for his family . . . but for America.&quot; The president acknowledged that &quot;passions may be running ever higher&quot; in the wake of the verdict but urged citizens to remember that a jury had spoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities . . . if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. . . . That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict did little to close the stark divisions the case opened up among Americans along the jagged fissures of race and personal safety - starting when Martin was shot about 18 months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Zimmerman attorney argued throughout the case that race had little bearing on the initial confrontation or the outcome. But the case has played out against a racially charged backdrop since Zimmerman followed the unarmed Martin as he walked through his central Florida neighborhood and later said a confrontation led him to shoot Martin in self-defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one side sees it, a racially biased criminal justice system was slow to charge Zimmerman and quick to believe a white man's version of events. The other side sees in Zimmerman a law-abiding citizen who tried to protect his neighborhood and properly claimed his right to carry a weapon in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters across the country decried what they called the injustice of Zimmerman's acquittal. They insisted that something must change in a court system and body of law that would allow an armed and self-appointed neighborhood watchman to pursue a black teenager, based on the suspicion that he was up to no good, and kill him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group called the Coalition for Justice for Trayvon hosted a rally Sunday afternoon at the Seminole County courthouse, where a jury of six women acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder. In Washington, critics of the verdict were pumping fists and chanting along the U Street corridor early Sunday morning. Among the placards they carried were these two messages: &quot;Stop criminalizing black men&quot; and &quot;Only White Life is Protected in America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP began circulating a petition late Saturday asking Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to take action in the case as the group held its annual conference in Orlando. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is time for the Department of Justice to act,&quot; the petition says. &quot;The most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a vigil Sunday night at Howard University, students, community members and alumni honored Martin with a moment of silence and the hymn &quot;Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing.&quot; Then Taylor Davis, a Howard student who is president of the school's NAACP chapter, delivered a rousing address that had the crowd shouting in affirmation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will honor the voice of the jury, but we will put ourselves in a position where they will honor our voices as well. Make noise,&quot; she said. She urged her listeners to sign the petition and to register to vote so that they can cast ballots against lawmakers who support legislation like the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that protected Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some people criticized the verdict, many argued that state investigators should have never prosecuted Zimmerman, because there was simply not enough evidence to prove who was the aggressor. Even legal analysts who said they strongly suspected that Martin was an innocent victim agreed that evidence proving so beyond a reasonable doubt - the standard that must be met for a guilty verdict - did not exist in this case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, there were no living witnesses other than Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said Martin punched him and threw him to the ground. A few neighbors testified that they heard yelps and saw an altercation but not who was doing the harm. A friend of Martin's said he had called her on her cellphone minutes before his death, complaining that he was afraid of a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys for Zimmerman said at a post-verdict news conference that they were ecstatic at the decision and praised the jurors, saying they weighed the evidence carefully. But defense attorney Mark O'Mara complained that some in the public and the media turned Zimmerman into a civil rights cause - and a monster. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If only those who decided to condemn Mr. Zimmerman as quickly and as viciously as they did would have taken just a little bit of time to find out who it was that they were condemning, it would never have happened,&quot; O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added another defense attorney, Don West: &quot;I think the prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful. . . . It makes me sad, too, that it took this long, under these circumstances, to finally get justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation of Martin's death shortly after his shooting. A department spokesman said Sunday that the investigation remains open and that officials are looking at whether there is enough evidence to pursue a civil rights case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for many Americans furious with the jury's decision, Sunday was a day to look to their religious faith for comfort and understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, who tweeted about her deep faith and quoted Proverbs 3:5-6: &quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also tweeted: &quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents and relatives were &quot;in church this morning, praying and turning to God, a higher authority, to make sense of it all,&quot; family attorney Benjamin Crump said Sunday on ABC's &quot;This Week With George Stephanopoulos.&quot; The family cannot believe the verdict, Crump said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't fault the prosecutors, he said, but they are trying to make sense of the jury's decision while continuing to mourn the 17-year-old's death. Family members are trying to decide what to do next and will look into filing a civil lawsuit. They have set up a foundation in Martin's memory and pledge to fight gun violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sermons Sunday, many pastors mentioned the verdict and the pain it had caused their flocks. At some churches, members wore hooded sweatshirts in Martin's honor to bring attention to racial stereotypes about young black men who wear such attire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sunday was a day of celebration for supporters of Zimmerman, who believed he had properly defended himself from a threat and should never have been prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., tweeted early in the day: &quot;Message from Dad: 'Our whole family is relieved'. Today . . . I'm proud to be an American. God Bless America! Thank you for your prayers!&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His brother said the former neighbourhood watch volunteer was still processing the reality that he wouldn't serve prison time for the killing, which Mr Zimmerman, 29, has maintained was an act of selfdefence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life,&quot; Robert Zimmerman Jr said during an interview on CNN. Mr Martin's killing in February 2012 unleashed furious debate across the US over racial profiling, self-defence and equal justice. Protesters across the country lashed out against police in the Orlando suburb of Sanford, outraged that it took 44 days for Mr Zimmerman to be arrested. Many, including Mr Martin's parents, claimed Mr Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen. Mr Zimmerman is Hispanic. Six anonymous female jurors - all but one of them white - considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Mr Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They deliberated more than 15 hours over two days before announcing late on Saturday night that they had reached a verdict. Defence attorney Mark O'Mara said in August 2012 that Mr Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, had been living &quot;like a hermit&quot; and weren't working because they feared for their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, police, officials and civil rights leaders urged peace and told protesters not to resort to violence. While defence attorneys said they were thrilled with the outcome, Mr O'Mara suggested Mr Zimmerman's safety would be an ongoing concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,&quot; Mr O'Mara said. &quot;They won't listen to a verdict of not guilty.&quot; Those watching the case re-acted strongly when the notguilty verdict was announced. Mr Martin's mother and father weren't in the courtroom when the verdict was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled &quot;No! No!&quot; upon learning of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Perkins, 55, a black resident of Sanford, angrily asked outside the courthouse: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot; &quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder,&quot; Mr Perkins shouted, so angry he shook, looking in the direction of the courthouse. &quot;He ain't getting no probation or nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's brother, Jahvaris Fulton, said simply on Twitter: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; - a reference to the Latin phrase &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; known as an expression of betrayal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters had taken to the streets in Florida, Atlanta and San Francisco, among other places. The demonstrators seemed to largely heed the advice of officials and others who urged them not to resort to violence.</SPAN></P>

However, he said, &quot;for Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin's family maintained the teen wasn't the aggressor, and prosecutors suggested Mr Martin was scared because he was being followed by a stranger. Defence attorneys, however, claimed Mr Martin knocked Mr Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the sidewalk when Mr Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him as a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighbourhood committed primarily by young black men.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans to respect the decision of jurors on Sunday following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that has bitterly divided the country along racial and partisan lines since the boy was gunned down more than a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; Obama said in a statement in which he referred to the slaying of the black 17-year-old as a &quot;tragedy&quot; for all of America. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's legal problems, however, seemed far from over a day after a jury of six Florida women cleared him of manslaughter and seconddegree murder charges - a</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called the police after he spotted Trayvon at night, but ignored orders not to confront the teenager, who he believed was &quot;up to no good.&quot; A fight ensued during which he shot Martin dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a mortgage underwriter described during the trial as a &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; smiled briefly after the verdict was read out and was hugged by his mother and father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were at the heart of the campaign for justice for their son, chose not to be in court on Saturday evening and spent Sunday morning in church. The Justice Department said in a statement on Sunday that it's investigating Martin's death to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman's been acquitted in the state case. - With files from London Daily Telegraph and The Associated Press</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 15--The real victims, as we now have learned, are the killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pity the poor killers, the men -- both of these killers are men -- who have no other choice than to kill an unarmed person to protect life and property. They are the ones who have to live with the consequences of their actions, such as having to live with crippling paranoia or not being able to watch violence on TV. The dead do not, by virtue of being dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lesson was imparted by two recent cases -- one of which you've probably heard more about than you care to ever hear, and another that, despite its nexus of sex and violence, sailed under the national media radar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first case, of course, is the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing in Florida. Poor George Zimmerman. His lawyers said he would have to live the rest of his life looking over his shoulder, in a constant state of paranoia, apparently worse than the level that prompted him to provoke a confrontation with a teenager armed with Skittles and an Arizona iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That case got all the press -- and was still dominating the news early this week -- because of the questions it raised about race and justice and just how insane Florida appears to be. It was easy to predict an acquittal, as Florida, generally speaking, is exempt from the standard rules of civilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman didn't speak for himself, but his brother Robert did. And if you thought it was scary that Zimmerman, a wannabe cop, was patrolling the streets of his neighborhood, he appears to be the tolerant one among his siblings. His brother, speaking on Piers Morgan's CNN show, said that his brother feared people who might &quot;take the law into their own hands&quot; and &quot;be vigilantes.&quot; (And irony dies yet another slow, painful death.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said, &quot;I want to know what makes people angry enough to attack someone the way that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure what he's talking about. If you'll recall, Zimmerman called 911, reporting that he saw a suspicious individual, who was suspicious, apparently, by virtue of being black in his neighborhood and wearing a hoodie. The 911 operator told him specifically not to do anything, but Zimmerman followed the teenager, thereby provoking the confrontation that left the 17-year-old dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That didn't matter under Florida law. Under Florida law, Zimmerman did not have the duty to retreat. He was within his rights to provoke this confrontation and then claim self-defense after its fatal conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-guilty verdict, depending on which experts you listened to, was either wholly justified or it, in essence, legalized homicide in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now we learn that Zimmerman was the ultimate victim here. His lawyer told the jury that it was Martin who was to blame, that his client was the only one who was injured in the encounter, pointing to the cuts on his head and his bloody nose and discounting the bullet hole in Martin's chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyers were on the morning talk shows Monday arguing that their client should get his gun back -- which he will -- to protect himself from those who now see him as a symbol of whatever he's supposed to be a symbol of, establishing his self-defense claim before he drops yet another unarmed teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, from that point of view, Zimmerman, not the dead kid, was the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the other case, which you may not have heard about, comes from Texas, which, Texans are quick to point out, is a different world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that case, a 30-year-old San Antonio man named Ezekiel Gilbert had contacted an escort on Craigslist on Christmas Eve 2009 and arranged a meeting. The tryst didn't go an expected for Gilbert. The escort took his $150, but declined to have intimate relations with him. Gilbert testified that she took the money and then walked around his apartment for 20 minutes before leaving. He testified that he believed the transaction was simple -- he paid money, he should get a service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than take the case to &quot;Judge Judy,&quot; he shot the escort, a 23-year-old woman named Lenora Ivie Frago, in the neck. Frago, initially, was paralyzed and later died. None of those facts were disputed during Gilbert's trial last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilbert, surprise, was acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyer argued that the shooting was justified because he was trying to retrieve stolen property. Under Texas law, a person may use deadly force to retrieve stolen property &quot;during a nighttime theft&quot; or during the commission of criminal mischief, protecting law-abiding citizens from thieving escorts and kids egging their homes and allowing them to shoot said escorts and kids dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A detective testified that Gilbert hadn't said anything about theft when police questioned him, and for his part, Gilbert said he didn't intend to kill the escort, shooting her in the neck notwithstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may seem insane, but it's Texas, running neck-and-neck with Florida in the race to be the most insane state in the union. (The real lesson from these two cases: If you're going to kill an unarmed person and want to get away with it, Florida and Texas are your best bets.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us to the victimization of Gilbert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters, &quot;I sincerely regret the loss of the life of Ms. Frago. I've been in a mental prison the past four years of my life. I have nightmares. If I see guns on TV where people are getting killed, I change the channel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So killing an escort has ruined &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; movies for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, that's too bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe we can take up a collection for him or something.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday was a rough day for Blair Fortson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the prosecutor in George Zimmerman's trial was delivering his closing argument, the 22-year-old Clayton State University senior was stuck in a car with his family, driving to Myrtle Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like much of America, Fortson has been riveted by what happened on the night when Zimmerman shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. For him, the trial is deeply personal, reverberating with all the slights that stung him growing up in and around Augusta: &quot;I lived around a lot of white folks who don't view us as people who could go further than they could.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Forston, Phil Parham has been engrossed in the case. But he sees it through a different lens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I try to ignore race, because it is a trap,&quot; said Parham, A 30-year-old law student at Georgia State University. &quot;When you bring up race, you are trying to get into someone's head to understand motivations. Here you have two guys in one place. Someone instigated it. One of them is dead. It all boils down to that, and what happened between those two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some events --- the Rodney King riots, the O.J. Simpson trial --- remind us of how powerfully our personal experiences influence the way we perceive the world, and of the degree to which the color of our skin, among many other things, may shape our experience. Parham and Forston are two young Georgia men, both thoughtful, both working to build meaningful lives, both men of good will, a few years apart in age, with a far piece between their points of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama said last March, &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon,&quot; he might have said, &quot;like Blair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing up, Forston said, two things he sensed often from white people were low expectations and fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mindset was, we couldn't achieve what they could achieve,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even last year, when he got what could be considered a low-level job to help pay for college --- a fork-lift driver --- he had to deal with stereotypes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They assumed that I was unintelligent --- and I was the only one in there who was in college,&quot; said Fortson, who is vice president of Clayton State's NAACP chapter. &quot;I told my boss one day that I was taking political science classes and could be president one day. The only thing he could say was, 'Not another one of you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one reason he sees guilt all over Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel within the depths of my heart that George Zimmerman is guilty. I do not feel that the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a result of self-defense of any type,&quot; Fortson said. &quot;Zimmerman was a coward and his ignorance of (black people) caused him to shoot Trayvon. He was afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that, he said, &quot;reflects the plight of the African-American male in our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parham grew up in Savannah with dreams of being an actor. He still dabbles a bit, but at 30, he decided it might be better to go to law school than to wait tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is interesting to look at a case like this and get a little taste of the law and see procedure at work,&quot; he said. It's especially interesting to contrast this experience with his memories of the Simpson trial, &quot;when I was naive to what the law was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a law student, I look at the case differently than I would have looked at it even a year ago,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I am looking at evidence. Does it meet all of the standards?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parham was 12 (and Forston was 4) in 1995 when a jury found O.J. Simpson not guilty of murder. That trial set the stage for the parade of sensational trials that are a staple of news, bloggers and social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case is indicative of the media hyping things up. It is a reflection of America's obsession with courtroom drama,&quot; Parham said. &quot;This is not the trial of the century. Not even close. We had Bernie Madoff, Michael Jackson, which is going on now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his view, there's little to distinguish the Zimmerman case from any incident in which two people come into conflict and one is killed. &quot;Why is this case more important than 100 other, similar cases? I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, he watched. Not for the voyeurism of it, but rather to learn. He watched the judge. The defense. The prosecution. The witnesses. Even how Zimmerman presented himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love being an armchair juror,&quot; Parham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he knows he'll never lack for opportunities. &quot;After O.J., we discovered that crime sells. So when they're done with this one, they will latch on to the next one. I am waiting for the Aaron Hernandez trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Forston, though, it's all about this trial, this death, and living life as a young black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In most cases, people like George Zimmerman see us and simply assume we are dangerous or threatening,&quot; Fortson said. &quot;We are subject stereotypes, misread, mis-educated and severely mistaken. My hope for this case is that it sets us on the path towards being recognized for everything that we truly are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New AJC Feature</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the nation awaited the verdict in the Zimmerman case, we talked to two men who were looking at the case from different viewpoints. Look for stories like this in Sunday Metro in a new feature that offers a fresh perspective on local and national news.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlantans reacted strongly to the Florida verdict clearing George Zimmerman --- but from opposite sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reached in Birmingham, where her husband, civil rights icon Joseph Lowery, was speaking late Saturday, Evelyn Lowery was floored by the decision, although she said they have seen similar verdicts more times than they can count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am just stunned. We both are,&quot; said Lowery, president of SCLC/WOMEN. &quot;I am very sad about the verdict and I am trying to just understand why.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry Henry, executive director of the gun rights group Georgia Carry, said the system worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only the people in the court and the six jurors heard the evidence, and they made their vote accordingly,&quot; Henry said. &quot;If they'd have voted the other way, the system would have still worked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed issued a statement saying: &quot;The genuine tragedy of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is that a mother and father lost their son senselessly. I find it troubling that a 17-year-old cannot walk to a corner store for candy without putting his life in danger. I find it more troubling that a citizen could not see a young African-American youth without immediately concluding that he was up to no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While I disagree with the jury's verdict, we must respect it. This case reminds me why my number one priority as mayor is public safety. I work every day to create a safer city where our sworn police officers are trained and equipped to effectively uphold the law, so that our residents feel secure in their neighborhoods and our diverse communities respect each other. The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shows that we must all work harder to shed the dangerous stereotypes that can have devastating consequences for individuals, families and our society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has been watched keenly by people on all sides of the issue, those who see it as a case of racial injustice, and those who see it as a simple case of self-defense gone awry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why this particular case reached any more furor than any of the other shootings, mob justice, or whatever else might go on,&quot; Henry said. &quot;In my opinion the local authorities were right when they declined to bring him to trial on the stand your ground law. It's over. Unfortunately. You've got one young man who's lost his life. And you've got one young man whose life is ruined because he took someone's life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Brinkley, 58, is a freelance writer who lives in the Peoplestown neighborhood of Atlanta and is no stranger to neighborhood crime. Like residents of Sanford, Fla., she suffered a break-in. But that is irrelevant, she said. Martin was not committing a crime, and Zimmerman was supposed to be protecting Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel very sad,&quot; Brinkley said. &quot;But you know, it's a white sad. I can't even imagine how black sad must feel right now. There's no justice for this kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going forward, Brinkley said she doesn't know what the answer is. But she said one thing is clear to her: &quot;There are too many guns out there and, personally, I'm nearly as afraid of the wannabe good guys who are walking around armed as I am of the deliberate criminals. I think it's fairly clear if he hadn't had a gun he wouldn't have gotten out of his car and he wouldn't have followed that young man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry Strange, a white telecommunications technician who lives in Newnan and owns multiple firearms, said that's not necessarily true. Zimmerman might have gotten out of his car anyway and been beaten to death, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe anybody that takes the initiative to be a watchman for the community or preserve the well being of the community they live in does so whether they have a firearm or not,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry said he understands others who feel differently might take to protests, though he disagrees with that notion since the court system did its job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one inflamed case and we're going to have to live through it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I THINK HE'LL probably be found not guilty, but it sure is hard to ignore the fact that ..... but for the actions of George Zimmerman, who did everything contrary to what the 911 operator instructed; who did everything contrary to the training provided by the Sanford, FL police officials to the neighborhood watch group, Trayvon Martin would be alive today. To walk away scot-free just seems wrong.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Roddy White apologized for comments he made on Twitter related to the George Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was found not guilty of murder Saturday in the shooting death of 17-year old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several NFL players reacted to the verdict over Twitter, with White writing, &quot;All them jurors should go home tonight and kill themselves for letting a grown man get away with killing a kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later apologized in another tweet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand my tweet last nite was extreme,&quot; White wrote Sunday. &quot;I never meant for the people to do that. I was shocked and upset about the verdict. I am sorry.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NFL said on Sunday it would not comment on the Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dixon wins again in Toronto IndyCar race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">TORONTO -- Scott Dixon doubled up with Izod IndyCar Series victories in Toronto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">After winning the first race Saturday in a frenzied race, he calmly delivered a nearly flag-to-flag effort on Sunday for his third consecutive victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dixon also won last week at Pocono Raceway, an oval track. He'll go for a fourth in succession at the next race, Aug. 4, at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend's doubleheader in Toronto was only the second in modern IndyCar history, with the first last month in Detroit. A driver winning both races was guaranteed a $50,000 bonus, plus the unclaimed $50,000 bonus from Detroit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dixon, who had a disappointing start to the season, is now only 29 points behind Helio Castroneves for the top spot. Dixon is a two-time series champion; Castroneves has never won such a title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dixon has three race wins in a row for the second time in his career. He also did it in 2007 when he won at Watkins Glen, Nashville and Mid-Ohio in succession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">This win also gave Dixon, a New Zealander, 32 victories for his IndyCar career, moving him past Dario Franchitti, Paul Tracy and Sebastien Bourdais for seventh place all-time. Bourdais wasn't all that disappointed. The former Champ Car champion, who scored his first IndyCar podium on Saturday with a second-place finish, finished third on Sunday to give Dragon Racing its second IndyCar podium, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Castroneves was second in this race and led two laps, giving him eight consecutive races as a leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six more players named as All-Stars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right-handed relievers Grant Balfour of the Oakland A's and Greg Holland of the Kansas City Royals, Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Chris Tillman, Atlanta Braves catcher Brian McCann, Pittsburgh Pirates right-handed relief pitcher Mark Melancon and San Francisco Giants closer Sergio Romo were officially named All-Stars on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balfour and Holland will replace inactive pitchers Bartolo Colon of the A's and Hisashi Iwakuma of the Seattle Mariners Tillman replaces Detroit Tigers ace Justin Verlander, who pitched Sunday, for the American League squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCann replaces inactive first baseman Freddie Freeman, also of the Braves. Melancon and Romo replace inactive pitchers Jeff Locke of the Pirates and Jordan Zimmermann of the Washington Nationals for the National League team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manziel leaves Manning camp with illness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas A&amp;M quarterback Johnny Manziel was excused from the 2013 Manning Passing Academy because of an apparent illness, ESPN reported Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manziel, the Heisman Trophy winner, was serving the camp as a college coach/counselor. He missed assigned meetings and practice sessions because of the illness, camp officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some earlier internet reports stated that Manziel was sent home by Archie Manning because of &quot;partying&quot; but camp officials said those reports were not accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp was at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, La.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Johnny Manziel did participate in some activities in the 2013 Manning Passing Academy as a college counselor/coach,&quot; camp officials said in a statement said. &quot;After missing and being late for practice assignments, Johnny explained that he had been feeling ill. Consequently, we agreed that it was in everyone's best interest for him to go home a day early.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manziel also attended the academy twice while he was in high school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I enjoyed meeting Johnny,&quot; Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning said. &quot;I can remember a 20-year-old Eli (Manning) missing a meeting and catching some flak. We always have counselors who leave early. Johnny was great with the campers for the time he was here. He had to leave early. I wish him the best and I want him to come back as a counselor next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro Football Hall of Fame removes Hernandez photo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, removed a photo of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photo of Hernandez, who was charged with murdering 27-year-old semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd, was the subject of complaints from visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the spirit of good taste we thought we'd take it down,&quot; said Joe Horrigan, vice president of communication and exhibits for the Hall of Fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photo depicts Hernandez running into the end zone during a game against the Green Bay Packers in 2010. It was the winner of an annual Hall of Fame photo contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Patriots released Hernandez after he was arrested in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Peace clears waivers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metta World Peace cleared waivers late Sunday afternoon, and according to ESPN, the New York Knicks already have reached out to the 14-year NBA veteran to gauge his interest in playing in his hometown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Peace has indicated he wants to play for the Knicks, but he also talked to Yao Ming on Sunday about playing in China. The former Los Angeles Laker also has shown some interest in remaining in Los Angeles to play for the Clippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know his name has been surfacing out there,&quot; Knicks coach Mike Woodson told ESPN while in Las Vegas, where New York has a summer league team competing. &quot;I like his skill sets a lot. I think a lot of teams have liked his skill sets over the years. He does a little bit of everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being waived on Thursday, World Peace expressed no desire to play in his hometown of New York. In fact, he was hoping not to be claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't really want to play for anybody,&quot; World Peace said. &quot;I don't want to go anywhere. I want to go to China, or coach or play arena football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamaican sprinters Powell, Simpson test positive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINGSTON, Jamaica -- Former world 100 meters record holder Asafa Powell and Olympic 4&Atilde;--100 relay silver medallist Sherone Simpson have both tested positive for the stimulant oxilophrine at last month's Jamaican athletics championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement on Sunday, Powell said he had tested positive for the stimulant, which has similar properties to ephedrine but a different chemical structure and is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) banned list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to be clear in saying to my family, friends, and most of all my fans worldwide that I have never knowingly or wilfully taken any supplements or substances that break any rules. I am not now, nor have I ever been, a cheat,&quot; Powell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell, who has never won an individual global sprint title, held the 100 world record between 2005 and 2008 when his mark of 9.74 seconds was broken by current record holder and fellow-Jamaican Usain Bolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simpson, who was a member of the Jamaican 4x100 metres relay team who won the silver medal at last year's London Olympics, said she had been notified that she had tested positive for &quot;This is a very difficult time for me,&quot; Simpson said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an athlete, I know I am responsible for whatever that goes into my body. I would not intentionally take an illegal substance of any form into my system.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">751  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Florida jury found neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a racially charged trial that transfixed the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial raised strong passions among those who believed that Zimmerman -- whose father is white and whose mother is Peruvian -- had racially profiled Martin, and those convinced that the volunteer watchman acted in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin, 17, through a gated community in Sanford, Florida, and shooting him during an altercation on a rainy night on February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing led to mass marches in several US cities after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing more protests and outbreaks of violence after the verdict, activists and community leaders appealed for calm. Police were out in force in Sanford, and the crowd of several hundred gathered outside the courthouse was loud at times but peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous protest marches however were staged overnight in US cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta, US media reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, we are ecstatic with the results. George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense,&quot; said his lead attorney Mark O'Mara after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Don West was even more blunt. &quot;I think the prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers insisted that Zimmerman acted in self-defense after Martin wrestled him to the ground and slammed his head on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict was read. His family grinned broadly as they sat behind him in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, people who fear for their lives can use deadly force to defend themselves without having to flee a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though I am broken-hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY,&quot; Martin's father Tracy wrote on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both he and Martin's mother Sybrina Fulton gave thanks for the outpouring of support they had received over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's older brother Robert also took to Twitter: &quot;Message from Dad: 'Our whole family is relieved.' Today... I'm proud to be an American. God Bless America! Thank you for your prayers!&quot; he tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders called for calm after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies. Find a way for self construction not deconstruction in this time of despair,&quot; wrote civil rights leader Jesse Jackson on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activist Al Sharpton posted a statement on Facebook describing Zimmerman's acquittal as &quot;a slap in the face to the American people,&quot; and said that he was convening &quot;an emergency call with preachers (to) discuss next steps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP, the largest US civil rights group, urged supporters to sign a letter asking Attorney General Eric Holder to file civil charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; read the NAACP letter. &quot;We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors argued that Zimmerman, who pursued Martin against the advice of a police dispatcher, instigated the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The all-female jury had to reach a unanimous verdict to convict or acquit, and deliberated for more than 16 hours on the case after closing arguments by the two sides Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The jury was also instructed to consider an alternate charge of manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict. Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court,&quot; Judge Deborah Nelson said shortly after the decision was read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Prosecutor Angela Corey argued that the tragic case was a test of Florida's gun laws as well as social boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case has never been about race, nor has it ever been about the right to bear arms,&quot; Corey said. &quot;But Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was profiled. There is no doubt that he was profiled to be a criminal. And if race was one of the aspects in George Zimmerman's mind, then we believe that we put out the proof necessary to show that Zimmerman did profile Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case gained worldwide attention after Zimmerman, 29, shot and killed unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida on February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial tensions were high during the trial as the defendant, a Hispanic American, was accused of profiling the 17-year-old, who was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman avoided life in prison on a charge of second-degree murder when the jury announced a not guilty verdict Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alec Baldwin reactivated his Twitter account Saturday to comment on the acquittal of an accused murderer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star slammed the door on his account late last month after an explosive rant aimed at a journalist who had accused his wife of tweeting during James Gandolfini's funeral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently the not guilty verdict announced Saturday in Zimmerman's case was enough to prompt Alec's resurgence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star kept it brief when commenting on the outcome of the trial, which saw Zimmerman, 29, charged with second-degree murder in the death of an unarmed 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin was gunned down near his home in Sanford, Florida in February 2012 and the defendant, a Hispanic American, had been accused of racially profiling the teen, who was black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida is a parallel universe. A f**ked up one.&quot; Alec wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His note came about 90 minutes after the verdict was announced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alec's previous rant was deleted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The star came under fire last month for what some called &quot;homophobic&quot; comments aimed at a male reporter. Alec declared the MailOnline journalist a &quot;toxic little queen&quot; for erroneously reporting about his wife's alleged tweets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much of this sh*t are people supposed to take? With these f**king blatant lies EVERY DAY,&quot; Alec fumed. &quot;My wife DID NOT use her phone, in any capacity, at our friends funeral. Now, f**k this twitter + good luck to all of you who know the truth (sic),&quot; he continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MailOnline later admitted to the error, blaming a &quot;Twitter bug&quot; in the website's timestamp system for the report.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges Saturday in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing unleashed furious debate across the U.S. over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his Facebook page after the verdict was announced, Mayor Josh Cohen urged Annapolis residents to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My earnest hope tonight is that those who are disheartened by the verdict will not channel their anger through violence, which accomplishes nothing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading activists in the local African-American community also urged calm, although they said the verdict raised issues about the fairness of the U.S. justice system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, blinked and barely smiled when the verdict was announced. He could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter. But the jury of six women, all but one of them white, reached a verdict of not guilty after deliberating well into the night Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother and father were not in the courtroom when the verdict was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled &quot;No! No!&quot; upon learning of the not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys said the case was classic self-defense, claiming Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men. Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Louis J. Boston, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Annapolis, said the reaction to the case has taken equality back another step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We work so hard to have a fair playing field, but we aren't there yet,&quot; Boston said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that at his church, he plans to dialogue open, foster learning and move forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This boy is dead,&quot; Boston said. &quot;He's not alive to tell his version of the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County civil rights activist Carl O. Snowden said that as a lawyer he had thought a not-guilty verdict probable. He said that when he watched Zimmerman's acquittal on television, he wasn't sure how to react at first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prosecutor had an uphill battle with this,&quot; Snowden said. &quot;From this decision, we have to learn from it and continue to talk about the importance of a fair justice system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowden said he and other civil rights activists will continue to fight for equality. He urged residents to remain calm while they process the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Violence won't help,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman defense attorney Mark O'Mara said his team was &quot;ecstatic&quot; about the verdict. &quot;George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of his defense team, Don West, said: &quot;I'm glad this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Zimmerman's mindset &quot;fit the bill of second-degree murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We charged what we believed we could prove,&quot; Corey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the verdict drew near, police and city leaders in the Orlando suburb of Sanford and other parts of Florida said they were taking precautions against the possibility of mass protests or unrest in the event of an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said immediately after jurors began deliberating. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict came a year and a half after civil rights protesters angrily demanded Zimmerman be prosecuted. That anger appeared to return Saturday night outside the courthouse, at least for some who had been following the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosie Barron, 50, and Andrew Perkins, 55, both black residents of Sanford, stood in the parking lot of the courthouse and wept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I at least thought he was going to get something, something,&quot; Barron said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added her brother: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perkins was so upset he was shaking. &quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder,&quot; Perkins shouted, looking in the direction of the courthouse. &quot;He ain't getting no probation or nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman wasn't arrested for 44 days after the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting as police in Sanford insisted that Florida's Stand Your Ground law on self-defense prohibited them from bringing charges. Florida gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, along with civil rights leaders such as the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, argued that Zimmerman - whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic - had racially profiled their son. And they accused investigators of dragging their feet because Martin was a black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before a special prosecutor assigned to the case ordered Zimmerman's arrest, thousands of protesters gathered in Sanford, Miami, New York and elsewhere, many wearing hoodies like the one Martin had on the night he died. They also carried Skittles and a can of iced tea, items Martin had in his pocket. President Barack Obama weighed in, saying that if he had a son, &quot;he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial. Even after the verdict, prosecutors said race was not about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case has never been about race or the right to bear arms,&quot; Corey said. &quot;We believe this case all along was about boundaries, and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One exception was the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, the Miami teen who was talking to Martin by phone moments before he was shot. She said he described being followed by a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; as he walked through the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel gave some of the trial's most riveting testimony. She said she overheard Martin demand, &quot;What are you following me for?&quot; and then yell, &quot;Get off! Get off!&quot; before his cellphone went dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors had to sort out clashing testimony from 56 witnesses in all, including police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, witnesses who got fleeting glimpses of the fight in the darkness gave differing accounts of who was on top. And Martin's parents and Zimmerman's parents both claimed that the person heard screaming for help in the background of a neighbor's 911 call was their son. Numerous other relatives and friends weighed in, too, as the recording was played over and over in court. Zimmerman had cuts and scrapes on his face and the back of his head, but prosecutors suggested the injuries were not serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To secure a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury that Zimmerman acted with a &quot;depraved&quot; state of mind - that is, with ill will, hatred or spite. Prosecutors said he demonstrated that when he muttered about &quot;punks&quot; who &quot;always get away&quot; during a call to police as he watched Martin walk through his neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>

But the US Justice Department may pursue the case under civil rights law, and Trayvon's parents are considering whether or not to file wrongful death civil charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE 4:25 PM The Department of Justice said Sunday it would review the Travyon Martin-George Zimmerman case to determine if it should consider prosecuting Zimmerman, who was acquitted Friday in a Florida court, in the shooting case, reports Politico. &quot;Experienced federal prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction, and whether federal prosecution is appropriate in accordance with the Department's policy governing successive federal prosecution following a state trial,&quot; the DOJ said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criminal trial of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin may be over, but the political, social, and legal reaction is likely to continue for months if not years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the immediate aftermath of the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict, there have been protests around the country, marked by some vandalism and destruction of property. But for the most part, any angry reaction to Mr. Zimmerman's walking free has been subdued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, where the case was heard, many churches planned to remain open throughout the day, the Miami Herald reported. &quot;Every church should be open ... to enforce the word not to retaliate,&quot; the Rev. Vernon Gillum told the newspaper. The CBS affiliate in Miami reported that police had erected at least two so-called First Amendment Zones for protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, anything more serious than rhetorical protest has been limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windows were broken and small street fires were started in Oakland, Calif., police reported. The Oakland Tribune said some windows on the newspaper's downtown offices were broken, and footage from a television helicopter show people attempting to start fires in the street and spray painting anti-police graffiti, the Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles, about 200 protesters gathered in Leimert Park, the city's historically black neighborhood, for what police termed a peaceful vigil. &quot;Justice 4 Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; rallies were planned for Sunday in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the immediate public response to a 17-month episode that heightened and sharpened the public conversation on race, guns, and the US justice system, officials are considering whether to pursue the case any farther.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US Justice Department has been closely following the case of a legally-armed neighborhood watch volunteer who took it upon himself to follow and confront an unarmed black teenager apparently minding his own business, then shot him dead when a physical confrontation ensued and he felt threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The racial issue is complicated. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was black; George Zimmerman's father is white and his mother is Hispanic.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP and other civil rights groups are urging the Justice Department to pursue the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We call immediately for the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the civil rights violations committed against Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Roslyn M. Brock, Chairman of the NAACP, said in a statement . &quot;This case has re-energized the movement to end racial profiling in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On CNN's &quot;State of the Union&quot; Sunday, NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said, &quot;When you look at [Zimmerman's] comments, when you look at his comments about young black men in that neighborhood, about how they felt specially targeted by him, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents are considering whether or not to file wrongful death civil charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are going to certainly look at that as an option,&quot; their attorney, Benjamin Crump, said on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; Sunday. &quot;They deeply want a sense of justice. They deeply don't want their son's death to be in vain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for now, Mr. Crump said, &quot;They're in church this morning, praying and turning to God, a higher authority, to make sense of it all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents - Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton - weren't in the courtroom when the verdict was read, but reacted on Twitter Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's father, expressed his disappointment with the verdict, tweeting, &quot;Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, tweeted &quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life will never be the same for them, nor will it be for the man who killed their son despite a verdict that set him free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are factions, there are groups, there are people that would want to take the law into their own hands as they perceive it, or be vigilantes in some sense,&quot; Robert Zimmerman Jr., George Zimmerman's brother, said on CNN after the verdict had been announced Saturday night. &quot;They think that justice was not served, they won't respect the verdict no matter how it was reached and they will always present a threat to George and his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">USA</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1366 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of America sees the not guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman case as a travesty of justice, a modern iteration of Jim Crow, where a white man walks free after shooting an innocent black person, in this case an unarmed Florida teenager named Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another part sees in the verdict the emergence of another kind of civil rights movement, a gun freedom movement ultimately tested in the Zimmerman trial by a state willing to forego hard evidence in order to try to prosecute what police originally deemed an open and shut self-defense case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors in the case said Zimmerman had evil in his heart and that he crossed legal boundaries when deciding to follow an innocent Trayvon before shooting him on a rainy February night last year. Zimmerman supporters, though, say he was providing a civic duty in a post-9/11 America, where safety and crime concerns have become paramount even as overall crime rates have dropped to historic lows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overarching theme of the Zimmerman trial and its verdict is the way it points to an emerging &quot;siege mentality&quot; that's driving Americans apart, to the point where Trayvon and Zimmerman traded blows and gun fire instead of respectful inquiry, writes Charles Ray, a Sanford resident, in a verdict response in Yahoo! News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet in much of the post-verdict debate, the issue comes back to the anxious interaction between race and guns, fueled for many by black-on-black killings in places like Chicago as much as the alleged profiling by Zimmerman when he decided to follow Trayvon&nbsp;Martin for no other reason than he looked, at least to Zimmerman, like a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some commentators say the shooting, the publicity and the eventual trial highlighted a sort of cultural settling, and perhaps sunsetting, of the civil rights movement (the Supreme Court declawing the Voting Rights Act came in the run-up to the trial}, at a time when society is tackling more vigorously the new frontier of liberalized gun and self-defense rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public conversation about race tilts toward a more enlightened attitude about civil rights, but the conversation about guns is extremely conflicted, regional, socioeconomic, and divided in every conceivable way,&quot; Austin jury consultant Doug Keene told the Monitor last month. &quot;This year, for all the tragic reasons we're aware of, gun policy has become a constant presence ... in our neighborhood conversations, and the lack of agreement on correct policy about guns is going to be one of the legacies of this trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, civil rights icons like Dr. Bernice King, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s daughter, Tweeted that the verdict would be a gauge on the state of equal rights in America. In a mass reaction to an early decision by Sanford police to not charge Zimmerman, civil rights activists had mentioned Trayvon in the same breath as Medgar Evers and Emmet Till, young black men whose violent deaths fueled the civil rights movement and eventual passage of equal rights legislation in the mid-1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If u really believe racism isnt a massive problem, that the oppression of minorities is not a horrific and systemic issue ... U R in denial,&quot; Tweeted the actress Ellen Page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, prosecutors seemed to be trying to answer an existential question instead of providing necessary facts to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is that when a grown man, frustrated, angry, with hate in his heart, gets out of his car with a loaded gun and follows a child?&quot; prosecutor John Guy asked the six jurors - all women, five of them white - before they began a 16-hour deliberation that ended late Saturday night. &quot;A stranger? In the dark? And shoots him through his heart? What is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the big picture visuals of the case echoed past civil rights battles, others believe the George Zimmerman trial instead may bolster the bold assertion by the National Rifle Association that ending persecution of lawful gun owners by the state is the new &quot;civil rights movement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Zimmerman acquittal will be bad news politically to the gun prohibition lobby, which is also anti-self-defense,&quot; writes Dave Workman for Examiner.com. &quot;Gun grabbers do not like it when armed citizens defend themselves, demonstrating one case at a time that guns in the right hands are good, and dead criminals pose no further threat to the community. Recent years have seen an increasing number of people successfully using guns in self-defense with no criminal charges, a scenario that seems to elicit revulsion or stony silence from the gun control crowd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman supporters say the state overreached, putting hate in Zimmerman's heart, where there was none. Instead, they say, he was a would-be public servant who cared about his neighborhood, and the people in it - whether black or white. On the night of Trayvon's death, however, Zimmerman bucked neighborhood watch protocols to follow Trayvon, whom he had pegged as suspicious and, under his breath to a dispatcher, likened to &quot;punks&quot; that &quot;always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whatever his motives and potentially questionable actions, Zimmerman was a legal gun owner who had the right to get out of his car in his own neighborhood and poke around. The jury also said he had a full right, under Florida law, to defend himself with deadly force if he felt in fear of his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Death is unfortunate, a byproduct of returning force with appropriate force,&quot; said Robert Zimmerman, Jr., George Zimmerman's brother, to CNN's Piers Morgan. &quot;The jury saw the blood, they saw what Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did to my brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, many of those involved in the trial see the verdict as the opposite of justice for Trayvon, punctuated by what they perceive as the bitter taste of racism, particularly when it comes to how critically society views young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're intellectually dishonest if we don't acknowledge the racial undertones of this case [and questions it raises] about how far we have come in America in matters of equal justice,&quot; said Ben Crump, the Martin family's attorney, after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet while the specter of racial profiling and institutional indifference to the plight of a black boy drove myriad &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; rallies and protests, the trial itself rarely mentioned race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the presiding county judge, Debra Nelson, excluded the term &quot;racial profiling&quot; from the trial. One of the few mentions of race included Trayvon's view of Zimmerman as a &quot;crazy-ass cracker,&quot; a racial term for poor whites, uttered by Trayvon as he spotted Zimmerman, according to his friend, Rachel Jeantel. The two were on the phone until the moments before Trayvon was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Corey, the special prosecutor who arrested Zimmerman 44 days after Trayvon's death, said after the verdict that the debate outside the courtroom didn't always match the procedural and legal wrestling match in Courtroom 5D.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case has never been about race or the right to bear arms,&quot; Ms. Corey said. &quot;We believe this case all along was about boundaries, and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, George Zimmerman &quot;no longer has any business&quot; in front of the criminal courts, as the judge put it, though the US Justice Department said Saturday that it's considering a plea from the NAACP to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. In that way, the tension between expanded gun-carry rights and profiling may not have been fully resolved for George Zimmerman, at least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department continues to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, as well as the evidence and testimony from the state trial,&quot; a spokesman for the Justice Department said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that juries aren't privy to any evidence or conjecture beyond what the judge allows, the Zimmerman trial proved to some that courtrooms aren't ideal venues to resolve deeper societal prejudices, whether against minorities or gun owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These kinds of trials &quot;can ... never fully answer the larger societal questions they pose,&quot; writes Andrew Cohen, in the Atlantic. &quot;The can never act as moral surrogates to resolve the national debates they trigger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Sanford, meanwhile, said they will return the Kel-Tec 9mm pistol used to kill Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama on Sunday afternoon issued a statement about the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, calling for &quot;calm reflection&quot; following &quot;a tragedy for America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday night, Mr. Zimmerman was found not guilty following a jury trial and 17 months of public debate and considerable anguish over what's been seen as a tragedy involving race, civil rights, criminal justice, and America's gun culture. (Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was black; Zimmerman's parents are white and Hispanic, and he was legally carrying a pistol.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, the President's only notable comment on the shooting death of the black teenager came last year when he said, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; In his statement Sunday, Obama makes no direct reference to Zimmerman, who still may face civil charges and an investigation by the US Justice Department under civil rights law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's Obama's full statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Zimmerman trial approached, and in its immediate aftermath, law enforcement officials warned of and then prepared for any disruptive or violent protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was minor vandalism in Oakland, Calif., and a few other cities. But for the most part, rallies and other events remained peaceful Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanford Pastors Connecting, an alliance of Seminole County, Florida, churches formed after the shooting, said it is sponsoring the noon prayers Monday to promote peace and unity in the community, USA Today reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our call is to pray for our community for the long-term unity, peace and strength of relationships,&quot; said the Rev. Charlie Holt of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Lake Mary. &quot;Our churches welcome any and all to come and offer prayer to the Lord for ourselves, for all involved and for our community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, we are ecstatic with the results.

Many of the demonstrators were chanting, &quot;no justice, no peace.&quot; <BR><BR>Florida Prosecutor Angela Corey argued that the tragic case was a test of Florida's gun laws as well as social boundaries. <BR><BR>&quot;This case has never been about race, nor has it ever been about the right to bear arms,&quot; Corey said. &quot;But Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was profiled. There is no doubt that he was profiled to be a criminal. And if race was one of the aspects in George Zimmerman's mind, then we believe that we put out the proof necessary to show that Zimmerman did profile Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;<BR><BR>&quot;But the right to bear arms is a right in which we all believe. I especially believe in that will right. What we want is responsible use when someone feels they have to use a gun to take a life,&quot; Corey added, saying: &quot;They have to be responsible in their use, and we believe that this case all along was about boundaries.&quot; <BR><BR>The jury had deliberated for more than 16 hours since Friday in the case. <BR><BR>Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin through a gated community in Sanford, Florida and shooting him during an altercation. <BR><BR>Defense lawyers insisted Zimmerman acted in self-defense after Martin, 17, wrestled him to the ground and started bashing his head into the pavement. <BR>Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The jury was also instructed to consider an alternate charge of manslaughter, which carries up to a 30-year sentence. <BR><BR>&quot;Mr. Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict. Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court,&quot; Judge Deborah Nelson said shortly after the decision was read. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The February 2012 killing ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman. <BR><BR>Community leaders on Friday had called for calm regardless of the eventual verdict. <BR><BR>&quot;If Zimmerman is convicted, there should not be inappropriate celebrations, because a young man lost his life,&quot; Reverend Jesse Jackson, a veteran civil rights activist, said. <BR><BR>&quot;If he is not convicted, we should avoid violence because it will only lead to more tragedies.&quot; <BR><BR>SHOTLIST: <BR><BR>SANFORD, FLORIDA, JULY 13, 2013, SOURCE: AFP / POOL  <BR>No US cable news outlets, free over-the-air networks or stations, their websites and their mobile phone services <BR><BR>George Zimmerman hearing verdict in the courtroom <BR>VAR of reaction after verdict (no audio) <BR><BR>DURATION: 01:12 <BR>CIHAN</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FLORIDA (CIHAN)- A six-woman jury Saturday found neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a racially-charged trial that transfixed the United States. <BR><BR>The trial raised strong passions among those who believed that Zimmerman -- whose father is white and whose mother is Peruvian -- had racially profiled Martin, and those convinced that the volunteer watchman acted in self defense.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, had been accused of pursuing Martin, 17, through a gated community in Sanford, Florida and shooting him during an altercation in February 2012. <BR><BR>The killing ignited widespread controversy after police initially declined to press charges against Zimmerman. <BR><BR>&quot;Obviously, we are ecstatic with the results. George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense,&quot; said his lead attorney Mark O'Mara. <BR><BR>Defense attorney, Don West, was even more blunt. &quot;I think the prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful,&quot; he said. <BR><BR>Defense lawyers insisted that Zimmerman acted in self-defense after Martin wrestled him to the ground and slammed his head on the pavement. <BR><BR>Zimmerman smiled briefly but did not appear emotional as the verdict was read. His family was grinning broadly as they sat behind him in the courtroom. <BR><BR>According to Florida's controversial 'Stand Your Ground' law, people who fear for their lives are authorized to use deadly force without having to flee a confrontation. <BR><BR>Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family was not present for the verdict. <BR><BR>Community leaders called for calm after the verdict was read. <BR><BR>&quot;Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies. Find a way for self construction not deconstruction in this time of despair,&quot; wrote rights leader Jesse Jackson in a Twitter message. <BR><BR>Another rights activist, Al Sharpton, issued a statement posted on his Facebook account describing Zimmerman's acquittal as &quot;a slap in the face to the American people but it is only the first round in the pursuit of justice.&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;We intend to ask the Department of Justice to move forward as they did in the Rodney King case and we will closely monitor the civil case against Mr. Zimmerman,&quot; said Sharpton, adding that he was convening &quot;an emergency call with preachers&quot; to &quot;discuss next steps.&quot; <BR><BR>Rodney King was an African-American man who was beaten by Los Angeles police following a car chase in April 1991. The beating was videotaped and aired on television, sparking widespread outrage. When the officers involved in the beating were acquitted in April 1992, widespread rioting broke out in Los Angeles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP, the largest US civil rights group, launched a petition drive to seek a civil trial against Zimmerman, and urged supporters to sign a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking civil charges.  <BR><BR>&quot;The most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; read the letter. &quot;We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.&quot;  <BR><BR>Prosecutors argued that Zimmerman, who pursued Martin against the advice of a police dispatcher, instigated the confrontation.  <BR><BR>The jury, which had to reach a unanimous verdict to convict or acquit, deliberated for more than 16 hours on the case since Friday.  <BR><BR>Zimmerman faced possible life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The jury was also instructed to consider an alternate charge of manslaughter, which carries up to a 30-year sentence.  <BR><BR>&quot;Mr. Zimmerman, I have signed the judgment that confirms the jury's verdict. Your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off when you exit the courtroom over here. And you have no further business with the court,&quot; Judge Deborah Nelson said shortly after the decision was read.  <BR><BR>Florida Prosecutor Angela Corey argued that the tragic case was a test of Florida's gun laws as well as social boundaries.  <BR><BR>&quot;This case has never been about race, nor has it ever been about the right to bear arms,&quot; Corey said. &quot;But Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was profiled. There is no doubt that he was profiled to be a criminal. And if race was one of the aspects in George Zimmerman's mind, then we believe that we put out the proof necessary to show that Zimmerman did profile Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;  <BR><BR>SHOTLIST:  <BR><BR>SANFORD, FLORIDA, JULY 13, 2013, SOURCE: CBS  <BR><BR>RESTRICTIONS:  <BR><BR>*NO RESALE for non-editorial purposes*  <BR>No Japan  <BR>No Free over-the-air broadcasters in Australia  <BR>No US cable news outlets, free over-the-air networks or stations, their websites and their mobile phone services  <BR><BR>VAR of protest outside court  <BR><BR>SOUNDBITE 1 Protester (woman) (English, 13 sec):  <BR>&quot;Heartbroken, heartbroken for Trayvon parents. Me as a parent, as a grandmother, got young grandsons coming up in society. This should not happen.&quot;  <BR><BR>SOUNDBITE 2 Protester (woman) (English, 25 sec):  <BR>&quot;Shocked, completely shocked, disappointment. I have a son. I'm wearing a hood right now, I can be holding iced tea and a bag of Skittles myself. I think it was totally wrong, he was not armed, he was just walking, he has his ear plugs in and he was told, Zimmerman was told do not get out the car. That's breaking one law, one order from police enforcement, he's not a cop, he had no right doing what he did.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUNDBITE 3 Protester (man) (English, 18 sec):   <BR>&quot;It's said we live in a place called United States of America, when it always glamourize it this is the place to come, not for African American because we've been slaughtered, we've been worker for free since we've been here. We never get justice from a police killing or with another color killer.&quot;  <BR><BR>DURATION: 01:21  <BR>CIHAN</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Police declared unlawful assembly and were trying to disperse a crowd near Broadway and 14th Street after violence broke out Sunday night in the aftermath of the George Zimmerman acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A largely peaceful crowed of protesters marched through downtown Oakland on Sunday afternoon, but when nightfall struck, a small crowd began breaking windows and spray painting graffiti along Broadway. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two journalists, including a Bay Area News Group photographer and a TV cameraman were attacked -- one knocked over into bushes and the other thrown to the ground, swarmed and kicked by at least half a dozen assailants wearing black ski masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither sustained serious injury but their equipment was damaged in the fracas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the late-afternoon march, which started at Frank Ogawa Plaza in downtown Oakland, hundreds of protesters traversed some four-to-five miles and circled back to 14th Street and Broadway where they sat down about 7 p.m., blocking the intersection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marchers had been on the move for more than two hours, with police monitoring the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of 11 p.m. no arrests had been made. But about 10 p.m., a smaller group of protesters began vandalizing businesses along Broadway and Telegraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the afternoon demonstration, there were chants and shouts. &quot;Rest in peace Trayvon&nbsp;Martin; Rest in peace Alan Blueford; Rest in peace Oscar Grant. End the violence,&quot; shouted Sellassi Blackwell, 30, of San Francisco, as a crowd before him cheered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all Trayvon,&quot; said Reiko Redmonde, who organized Bay Area protests. &quot;This is not just a question for black youth but for all peoples' humanity, a question of what kind of society and what kind of world we want to live in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downtown property owners cleaned up storefronts damaged in a chaotic Saturday night protest as the demonstrations were held Sunday afternoon in Oakland and San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests had been planned Sunday in East Oakland at 73rd Avenue and International Boulevard, and also at 14th Street and Broadway, and Powell and Market streets in San Francisco. They were part of protests nationwide, with rallies Sunday in Florida, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, Fresno, Cleveland, and Los Angeles, where a demonstration turned violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, people walked onto Interstate 10 by the Crenshaw Avenue exit and clashed with police. At a nearby street corner a crowd threw rocks and batteries at officers, who fired beanbag rounds. There were no arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bay Area demonstrations came after a march that began Saturday, hours after a jury acquitted Zimmerman in a Florida courtroom. At 12:30 a.m. Sunday, Oakland protesters knocked trash cans into the street and sometimes set the contents alight, creating small fires amid cheers from onlookers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man was being beaten by multiple attackers in a Broadway doorway near Frank Ogawa Plaza until other protesters surrounded the skirmish and yelled at the combatants to stop. The man was helped to his feet and did not appear to be seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 12:45 a.m., demonstrators remained in the area around 19th and Telegraph but numbers had significantly diminished. Some shouted that police were trying to &quot;kettle&quot; them, or corral them into a limited area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday morning, property owners were boarding up storefronts and cleaning graffiti, but broken glass remained on sidewalks along Telegraph Avenue and Broadway, the two thoroughfares that bore the brunt of the vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the businesses damaged were Sears, the Oakland Tribune, and Flora, a restaurant in the 1900 block of Telegraph Avenue that was nevertheless busy during the lunch hour Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said, &quot;a small group of people gathered in downtown Oakland last night. Sadly, some of them dishonored the memory of Trayvon by engaging in violent activities that hurt our growing economy and endangered people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is unacceptable as well. We will not tolerate violence in our city. We must come together to heal and move forward,&quot; Quan said. &quot;In the days and weeks ahead our community will continue working to learn from this tragedy and to prevent this from ever happening again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first tragedy of the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case is that it was a case at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman had done as police instructed, there probably would have been no media circus and we would never have heard of either man. More important, the teenager would still be alive and Zimmerman would not have been charged with second-degree murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, Zimmerman, an armed neighborhood watch volunteer in a Florida gated community, did not stay in his vehicle and, for whatever reason, chose to engage the African-American teen whom he had been following.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That decision led to the tragic confrontation that left a young man dead from a gunshot to the chest, two families devastated, Zimmerman's life changed forever and spawned the latest gavel-to-gavel orgy of television courtroom drama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman's acquittal Saturday obviously relieved his family and friends, it also caused deep anguish for Martin's family and supporters, and has reinforced the notion of a racially biased legal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most who closely followed the case were not surprised by the acquittal. This is a state that has a so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that allows ordinary, nonpolice individuals to respond with lethal force when they are violently attacked. While it was not invoked in this trial, it does reflect a certain mindset about how Florida regards self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, there was some sort of an attack in this case, but the problem was establishing the aggressor. The prosecution alleged that it was Zimmerman who attacked Martin, while the defense claimed that it was actually the teen who attacked Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matters were further muddied during the trial when each man's mother separately took to the witness stand and unequivocally identified the screaming heard on a rough audio tape as that of her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, there was too much uncertainty about what really happened that night for a six-woman jury to be certain beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman was the aggressor. The jury had telegraphed its thinking when it asked the judge for reinstruction on the legal elements of manslaughter, a lesser charge than second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a challenging case from the beginning, although there were those who tried to pretend otherwise. To many in the nation who have suffered the crippling arrows of discrimination, this case reminded of a national history dotted with bigotry and a double standard of justice. This acquittal will only deepen those feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, we feel that the legitimate issues in this case have tended more toward the hyperbolic and political than the philosophical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been protests about the verdict and some -- including in Oakland -- have turned violent. Protesting is fine, but violence is unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extrajudicial portions of this case were rife with racial overtones. Once again we are reminded of the need for an honest -- and nonviolent -- national conversation about race and the American justice system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- There are few places where the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin at the hands of a neighborhood watch leader who once aspired to be a police officer resonated as it did in Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the city where Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a BART officer four years ago and the police department is under federal supervision in part over a failure to stop racial profiling, the 17-year-old Martin felt like kin to many African-American Oaklanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day after George Zimmerman was acquitted of charges in Martin's killing, residents' anguish poured out from pulpits, pews and city streets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In America, it doesn't matter if you're just walking home,&quot; Pastor Zachary Carey told parishioners at True Vine Ministries in West Oakland on Sunday. &quot;To them, we're all criminals. If you're black, you're a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many in the pews, the verdict confirmed two unpleasant but deeply-held beliefs: that just because the country elected an African-American president doesn't mean it fully values their lives, and that those most vulnerable in a society rife with fear of young African-American men, are the young men who must deal with people clutching their bags or questioning them as they approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see some of the other races, how they look at you with that suspicious eye,&quot; said 37-year-old Lamar Brantley of Oakland. &quot;A person that's fearful is liable to do anything. It does make me fearful at times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronda Johnson said that someone like Zimmerman might be a bigger threat to her two sons than gang violence, because while she can steer them away from gangs, &quot;Zimmerman was always prepared to look for someone like Trayvon,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Sunday afternoon, hundreds of people, many carrying signs reading, &quot;I am my brother's keeper,&quot; and &quot;We are all Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; gathered at Frank Ogawa Plaza for a march. Some two dozen police officers monitored the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Everest, a writer for Revolution Magazine, said, &quot;this verdict doesn't show the system as legitimate. It shows it's illegitimate. We need a whole new system,&quot; he said as the crowd clapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At True Vine Ministries earlier in the day, Carey directed members to turn outrage over the verdict into action, and denounced the &quot;senseless&quot; vandalism perpetrated in Martin's name throughout downtown Oakland on Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be marching on every state capital in America,&quot; he thundered. &quot;We should march on Washington and tell them that this is no longer acceptable in America and we're not going to take it anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, said he shot Martin in self-defense after Martin assaulted him and slammed his head against the sidewalk. At the heart of the case was why Zimmerman chose to follow Martin, who was walking home from a grocery store unarmed and wearing a hooded sweatshirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, the case shows the need to train police and the city's growing neighborhood watch movement on de-escalating conflicts, civil rights Attorney John Burris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The travesty in this whole case is that a young man minding his own business was deemed suspicious and wound up dead,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many people interviewed, Olis Simmons, who runs the nonprofit Youth UpRising in East Oakland, noted that African-American NFL star Michael Vick went to prison for harming dogs, but Zimmerman will not be punished for killing an African-American teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict was devastating because it says that the people who our nation needs to help it turn the corner can be killed at will because they fit the profile that the media has determined is threatening,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simmons said she is still struggling with what to say Monday to the teenagers in her program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell them the same thing I told them during the Oscar Grant stuff,&quot; she said. &quot;That violence isn't justice. And that civic engagement leads to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS WAS the main event playing out now in the courtroom in Sanford, Fla., and live on television, a minute before 10 o'clock. It was playing out fast in the courtroom, just four or five minutes from the time Judge Debra Nelson said, &quot;No outburst on the reading of the verdict&quot; until she told George Zimmerman, &quot;You have no further business in this court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what started on a rainy night in February 2012 when Zimmerman, a wannabe cop with a gun, decided that an unarmed 17-year-old kid named Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a threat because there had been break-ins around Retreat View Circle, decided Martin was some kind of suspect for the crime of walking around black in a hoodie, ended with a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict on Saturday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury of six women did not convict Zimmerman, the shooter, of second-degree murder, and did not convict him of manslaughter. The women went into the jury room to decide Zimmerman's fate on Friday and came out on Saturday night and decided that the state had not made its case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson said no outbursts and she asked for the verdict and Zimmerman and his lawyers stood at about a minute before 10 o'clock and heard &quot;Not guilty.&quot; And maybe four minutes later, Zimmerman was being told that his bond would be returned to him and his GPS ankle monitor would be cut off him and he would be free to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really, this was about the time it took for Zimmerman to finish his phone call with the Sanford police dispatcher on the night of Feb. 26, 2012, and the time that his encounter with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin began. The dispatcher asked Zimmerman if he was following the kid. Zimmerman said he was. The dispatcher told Zimmerman that he didn't need to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he wasn't just a neighborhood watch guy on this night, oh, no, George Zimmerman was a real cop, just without training or judgment. And even though Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was doing nothing more suspicious than walking down the street with Skittles and a can of Arizona soft drink, Zimmerman is the one who started the chain of events that ended up with him shooting and killing an unarmed kid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman walks now, leaves court a free man, does that in a state with its stand-your-ground laws where you thought the prosecution was fighting a losing game from the start. It no longer matters that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, unarmed teenager, was supposed to have the same stand-your-ground rights that Zimmerman did. Only it never mattered once they were on the ground and Zimmerman got his gun out and shot him. If you think justice was really served in that courtroom on this night, you were watching the wrong movie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am disappointed with the verdict,&quot; one of the prosecutors, Bernie de la Rionda, says at a media conference when it is over. &quot;But I accept it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin family, of course, does not have to accept it, can go forward now with a civil suit against George Zimmerman, one at which Zimmerman will be compelled to testify, something he certainly did not do in this trial. It turns out he didn't need to. But at least a civil suit may mean that Zimmerman, shooter, is only in the clear for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought he was guilty,&quot; Bernie de la Rionda said, and then he was asked if Florida's self-defense laws make his job harder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe in the right to bear arms and the right to self-defense,&quot; de la Rionda said. &quot;We just don't believe in this case it was appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because it sure was not. You keep going back to Zimmerman's call to that dispatcher. &quot;He's up to no good,&quot; George Zimmerman said, with absolute nothing to back up that claim. &quot;He's on drugs or something,&quot; Zimmerman said. About a black kid in a hoodie he had decided was some kind of menace to his neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense did a good enough job of convincing the six women on the jury that it was Zimmerman who was the real victim on that night, that it was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's job to walk away or run away, that he had no rights once Zimmerman had him in his sights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the threat and the danger on that night was Zimmerman, whether he beat the rap on Saturday night or not. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara made a big show in court, during closing arguments, of letting the jury know how long four minutes was, the time that O'Mara said Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had to walk away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When prosecutor John Guy rebutted, he said, &quot;Those four minutes were the last minutes of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few minutes that changed everything. A few more minutes to end it Saturday night. George Zimmerman finally gets to do what he should have done in the first place: Walk away.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FLORIDA JURY found George Zimmerman not guilty Saturday night in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - triggering a storm of outrage among civil rights activists.The 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer barely reacted after the verdict was read at 9:59 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His face nearly blank, Zimmerman merely shook the hands of one of his lawyers. It wasn't until three minutes later that he cracked a smile. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the Seminole County Courthouse, supporters of Martin's family cried out, &quot;No! No!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton blasted the verdict, calling it a &quot;slap in the face to those who believe in justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that this is an atrocity,&quot; he added. &quot;It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,&quot; said NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous, vowing to pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice.The verdict means Zimmerman escapes a lengthy prison sentence but still faces a likely civil suit for gunning down the unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It brings a stunning end to a more than year-long drama that began on a rainy night when Zimmerman encountered young Trayvon walking through the teen's townhouse complex in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, dressed in a hooded sweatshirt, was returning from a 7-Eleven where he purchased a package of Skittles and an Arizona fruit drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter.The verdict was handed down by a panel of six women that included just one minority member - but also five mothers. The jurors deliberated for more than 16 hours over two days, rendering a verdict that brought the Zimmerman family to tears. Several family members were still hugging each other as the ashen-faced prosecutors stormed out of the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents were not present for the verdict. But they bared their heartbreak in messages posted on Twitter.&quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you,&quot; wrote Sybrina Fulton. &quot;You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY,&quot; Martin's father, Tracy, tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors were restrained in their reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm disappointed,&quot; prosecutor Bernie De La Rondia said, &quot;but we accept the jury's verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense team expressed muted joy at a post-verdict news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am gratified by the jury's verdict,&quot; said lawyer Don West. &quot;As happy as I am for George Zimmerman, I'm thrilled that the jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., told CNN host Piers Morgan: &quot;I don't think this is a time for high-fiving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that his brother will never truly be a free man. &quot;He's going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; he said.The polarizing case riveted the nation and cast a spotlight on Florida's controversial &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys said the case was classic self-defense, claiming Martin tackled Zimmerman to the ground and was bashing his head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors portrayed Zimmerman as a &quot;wanna-be cop&quot; vigilante who profiled Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They argued that Zimmerman, frustrated by a spate of break-ins in his neighborhood, instigated the confrontation.The jurors began their second day of deliberations about 9 a.m. on Saturday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued deliberating into the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four hours before the verdict was announced, the jury - in a move that left defense lawyers unhappy and observers expecting a compromise verdict - asked for a clarification on the manslaughter charge against their client. That note came out of the jury room about 6 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel's request raised speculation that jurors could opt for the lesser charge against Zimmerman..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse earlier in the day, about 100 people gathered for word of a verdict in the racially charged case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We love you, George!&quot; shouted those on the murder defendant's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot; responded those seeking a Zimmerman conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some supporters of the Martin family wore hoodies in the blistering Florida sun in solidarity with the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff's deputies intervened to keep the two sides apart after one particularly heated exchange. The deputies stepped in before any punches were thrown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Saturday, the demonstrations remained peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, a Martin family lawyer, said the teen will go down in history alongside other civil rights heroes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till as a symbol for the fight for equal justice for all,&quot; Crump said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful.&quot;The jury spent 3 1/2 hours deliberating on Friday after hearing summations in the three-week trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, speaking earlier Saturday in Harlem, said the verdict would not signal the end of the legal fight - whether Zimmerman was guilty or innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain in his gated Florida community, was arrested 44 days after the shooting following coast-to-coast outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Obama weighed in, saying, &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But anger and disbelief over the long-delayed arrest went beyond the African-American community, as people throughout the nation saw it as a glaring example of unequal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Sanford was besieged by angry demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barraged with criticism, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, appointed State Attorney Angela Corey to revisit the case, and she decided there was evidence to charge Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the case came to be seen through a prism of black and white, it wasn't that simple. Zimmerman is part Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case also exposed the nation's ugly racist underbelly, with Zimmerman supporters flooding the Internet with photos of a thuggish-looking Trayvon that were actually the rapper Game and insisting - based on no evidence - that the high school junior from Miami Gardens was a budding gangster with a criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from Zimmerman, there were no witnesses to the struggle that ended with Trayvon dead with a bullet in his chest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin was the product of a vigorously contested trial that tested the limits of proving what happened in an unseen encounter between two men only one of whom survived. It demands respect as a fair but terribly unsatisfying verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on evidence presented openly to the jury and via television to all of America, the six-member jury could just as reasonably have convicted Zimmerman of manslaughter under the extremely convoluted Florida law that defines when a killing is justifiable or excusable. The panelists made the close and defensible call that Zimmerman's actions were both justifiable and excusable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he bears terrible responsibility for irresponsibly precipitating the fatal incident with Martin, the jury's focus was necessarily limited to what he did and why in their last moments together - not on what led to the fatal shot, not on the initial failure of Sanford authorities to prosecute Zimmerman, and not on the racial passions stirred by the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager who had been falsely profiled as a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, the only living witness, said that he had fired a single shot into Martin in self-defense. Since there was no question that the two were struggling, his account all but ruled out convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder, the extremely aggressive charge lodged by Florida prosecutors. The proof fell clearly short of documenting beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman had intentionally slain Martin with &quot;ill will, hatred, spite or an evil intent,&quot; as required by the state's penal code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the jury could easily have interpreted the testimony and forensic evidence to conclude that, although Martin had gotten physical with Zimmerman, he had not done so with the vehemence necessary for Zimmerman to reasonably believe that he had to defend himself with lethal force. After that, Florida specifically outlaws a killing &quot;by accident and misfortune resulting from sudden combat&quot; if the killer uses a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to argue that the jury wrongly stretched to find reasonable doubt in Zimmerman's favor. It is only to say that when the facts were matched against the law in a trial before a judge whose rulings were favorable to prosecutors, this emotionally and racially charged case was decided by the slimmest of edges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was composed of six women, all of whom were white. Although the panel's racial makeup reflects Seminole County's overwhelmingly white population, the lack of black representation was unfortunate in that it will likely fuel charges that the country's criminal justice system is stacked against equal justice even when an unarmed young black man is gunned down. Such assertions are no more valid under these circumstances than accusations by Zimmerman partisans that the verdict proves that he was railroaded into a murder trial merely to ease racial tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When an armed man kills an unarmed man after behaving recklessly - and evidence can be marshaled pointing to a crime - there's grist for a jury. Here, Zimmerman instigated the confrontation, provoked Martin into responding physically and then killed him, claiming legal justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's false assumptions about a black teenager wearing a hoodie at night in his neighborhood sparked the entire tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Zimmerman who profiled Martin as a &quot;punk&quot; rather than see him as what he was - a kid walking home from the store with a soda and a box of Skittles, looking forward to watching the second half of the NBA All-Star Game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Zimmerman who continued to follow Martin even after he was instructed to stand down by a police dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Zimmerman who chose to carry a gun, which can so readily escalate a misunderstanding into death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is Zimmerman who bears moral guilt for needlessly taking an innocent life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back this week for a second round of cabaret shows at swanky 54 Below nightclub, where he performed last month, the 34-year-old actor has savored his break from the Fox TV series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been an amazing summer of love and music,&quot; he told Daily News theater critic Joe Dziemianowicz. &quot;It's been memorable.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just over two weeks ago, Elton John and husband David Furnish spilled the beans that their pal Morrison (r.) and his girlfriend, Renee Puente, a singer and songwriter, were getting married. The announcement was made by Sir Elton at his annual White Tie and Tiara Ball in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then Puente's sapphire engagement sparkler, which has been likened to royal treat Kate Middleton's spectacular blue ring, has become a hot topic of conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrison takes it all in stride and doesn't hesitate to discuss his engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm happy to talk about it,&quot; said Morrison. &quot;It's exciting. It's also wonderful knowing that you have a life partner to be with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to be inspired by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wrote a song for her on my ukulele,&quot; Morrison reveals, adding that the title says everything you need to know about it: &quot;I'd Rather Sleep By Myself Than With Anyone But You.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leave it to reliable Mr. Shue - his character on &quot;Glee&quot; - to make the ukulele sexy, at least a little bit. &quot;It's such a happy instrument,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be surprised if Broadway vet Morrison pulls out his &quot;uke&quot; for a nontraditional take on &quot;We Kiss in a Shadow&quot; at 54 Below. His show, running Saturday through Wednesday, draws heavily from his album of standards and show tunes, &quot;Where It All Began.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like sharing my love of theater,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't look for Puente tucked into one of the club's snug banquettes. &quot;She's going to sit this one out,&quot; he says. &quot;She's got her own work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrison's service at &quot;Glee&quot; resumes July 22. That's two days after he sings with the Rochester Philharmonic upstate. &quot;We only get 2&frac12; months off from 'Glee,' &quot; says Morrison. &quot;I suppose I could have sat on a beach with a mai tai. But I'd rather have a mic in my hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S AVRIL FOOL'S DAY FOR BRODY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrities still haven't learned their lesson from Johnny Depp's infamous Winona Forever tattoo - which Depp changed to Wino Forever after their breakup back in 1993. Kim Kardashian's step-brother Brody Jenner recently went public with new girlfriend Bryana Holly, but he has yet to remove his &quot;Avril&quot; tattoo, which the reality star got while engaged to punk princess Avril Lavigne in 2011. The &quot;Sk8er Boy&quot; singer just tied the knot with Nickelback's Chad Kroeger in Cannes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GET READY FOR GAGA'S ART PROPS IN NOV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing Lady Gaga does should surprise us anymore, but her latest project sounds pretty impressive. Gaga, aka Stefani Germanotta, announced via Facebook that she'll release her next album, &quot;Artpop,&quot; on Nov. 11. Posing topless with minimal makeup and naturally curly hair, Gaga described an unprecedented app that will launch along with the album as a &quot;musical and visual engineering system.&quot; Intriguing - and mysterious - as always.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OCTAVIA 'STATION' CLOSE TO HOME</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer is no stranger to poignant movie roles, but at the MoMA premiere of her new film, &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; she told Confidenti@l why playing Oscar Grant's mother was a personal struggle. &quot;It's topical, with the Trayvon Martin case happening. And I'm an aunt. I have nephews who would be contemporaries of Oscar.&quot; But Spencer isn't serious all the time. When we complimented her sleek bangs, she told us, &quot;Well, I'm going to take 'em off as soon as I get home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERE'S A VIRTUAL WORK OF WONDER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder made a surprise appearance, via Skype, into the Global Citizen Festival at Milk Gallery in New York Thursday night from his studio in Los Angeles. Playing piano, Wonder said: &quot;We must make a difference in the world. Talk is cheap, but actions speak loud. So I'm proud to be a part of the Global Citizen Festival on the 28th of September. I will see you there.&quot; Also performing at the fest will be John Mayer, Alicia Keys and Kings of Leon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama hasn't made it onto Mount Rushmore quite yet, but his famous face has made it on to a pizza. Pizza master Domenico Crolla has turned the art of combining mozzarella and marinara sauce into an actual art form with his pizza-dough canvases. At his Glasgow restaurant Bella Napoli, Crolla has also made pizza faces of Kate Middleton, Beyonc&eacute;, Frank Sinatra and the Mona Pizza, um, Mona Lisa (r.).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The note from the jury came out around 6 p.m., after the panel had already deliberated for eight hours in the contentious case where Zimmerman is charged with killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel's request raised speculation that jurors could opt for the lesser count against Zimmerman in the fatal February 2012 fight inside a gated Florida community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seminole County Circuit Judge Debra Nelson, in her Friday jury instructions, told the jury to &quot;consider the circumstances surrounding the killing&quot; to find if manslaughter of second-degree murder was the appropriate charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense had argued against giving the jury an option with their verdict. A conviction on the higher count comes with a possible life sentence, while manslaughter carries a 30-year maximum term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury's long day of deliberations without a verdict inspired optimism among Martin's camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-woman jury &quot;staying out longer and considering the evidence and testimony is a good thing for us arriving at a just verdict,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, attorney for the slain teen's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors began deliberations around 9 a.m., took a one-hour break for lunch and continued deliberating into the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the Seminole County Courthouse, about 100 people gathered outside for word of a verdict in the racially charged case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We love you, George!&quot; shouted those on the murder defendant's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot; responded those seeking a Zimmerman conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some supporters of the Martin family wore hoodies in the blistering Florida sun - the same outfit worn by the victim on the night of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff's deputies intervened to keep the two sides apart after one particularly heated exchange outside the courthouse. The deputies stepped in before any punches were thrown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton, the mother of slain 17-year-old Martin, shared her favorite Bible verse via Twitter on Saturday morning:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIDEBAR: THREE KEY issues in the murder case against Zimmerman:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 Who started the fatal confrontation? The defense claims Trayvon&nbsp;Martin came at the defendant, while the prosecution portrays Zimmerman as the aggressor.-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 Who was on top in the scuffle before the fatal gunshots were fired? Witnesses gave contradicting accounts. One asserted Martin threw punches while Zimmerman was on the ground, while another said Zimmerman was atop the teen - and stood over the victim after the shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 Whose screaming voice was captured on a 911 call before the shooting? Zimmerman's parents identified the voice as their son. Martin's mother and father said it was their son's.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Bill Thompson, the only African-American in the mayoral race, tweeted that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, blasted the jury's verdict as &quot;a slap in the face to justice. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death was a terrible tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And City Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan) called the not-guilty verdict &quot;a shocking insult to his family and everyone seeking justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Anthony Weiner sent out this tweet: &quot;Keep Trayvon's family in our prayers. Deeply unsatisfying verdict. Trial by jury is our only choice in a democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controller John Liu, also was critical. &quot;Today's decision is shocking and highlights the sad reality that the day of equal justice for Trayvon and millions of other young men of color has yet to arrive,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there also was a reaction to the reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn), who has been at the forefront of the citywide debate over stop-and-frisk policing, sent what might have been one of the more provocative messages on twitter: &quot;I took a nap and I woke up still just a colored, negro, n----- male in America, land of my birth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in a gated, Sanford, Fla. community, tracks 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who is visiting his father there, as Martin walks through the neighborhood on the way back from buying candy at a convenience store. Zimmerman calls police to report a suspicious person, then gets out of his vehicle to follow Martin, though the dispatcher tells him &quot;we don't need you to do that.&quot; A short time later, a resident calls police to report a fight, followed by a gunshot. Martin has been fatally wounded. Police take Zimmerman into custody but release him later that night. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's father, who had filed a missing person report, learns of his son's death. Zimmerman accompanies police to the crime scene and gives his account, saying Martin sucker-punched and then beat him, and that he shot the teen because he believed Martin was reaching for his holstered gun. No charges are filed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was a neighborhood watch volunteer at his Sanford, Fla., gated community when he fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Feb. 26, 2012. Zimmerman is of white and Latino heritage - his mother is Peruvian - something friends and relatives have cited to rebut allegations that he racially profiled Martin, who was black. Zimmerman had a legal permit to carry the gun he used, and he said he fired in self-defense after Martin attacked him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was 17 when Zimmerman shot and killed him. His parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, divorced when he was a child, and he was living in Miami Gardens, Fla., with his mother and brother. He was visiting his father in Sanford when he encountered Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara is Zimmerman's lawyer. A criminal and family law attorney in central Florida for 28 years, he is a former felony prosecutor and has extensive trial experience in state and federal criminal defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernie de la Rionda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda is the assistant state attorney who presented the prosecution's case against Zimmerman. He was selected by the special prosecutor in the case, Angela Corey. She had been appointed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott to investigate Martin's shooting following protests over the Sanford Police Department's failure to arrest Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debra Nelson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson is the Seminole County judge who presided in the case. According to her online biography, Nelson was admitted to the Florida and Texas bars in 1979 and was appointed to the bench in 1999. She was assigned the case in August after the previous judge stepped aside amid allegations that statements he had made could be interpreted to indicate bias against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devin Davis, sitting on the floor of the Miami University Sports Hall of Fame's gallery at Millett Hall, says he &quot;ended up a guy who'll always be in the history books here.&quot; CONTRIBUTED BY E.L. HUBBARD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Archdeacon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devin Davis shows off T-shirts from two eras - one from his playing days at Miami University, and wearing one for the local business he started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OXFORD - This is a story of what else can happen when a black teenager from Miami, Fla., a kid who looks like no one else in the neighborhood, shows up in a mostly white environment and gets watched intently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the flip side of the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman saga that has played out so terribly in Sanford, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It features a then-18-yearold basketball player with a thick thatch of long, dread-locked hair; three gold-capped front teeth bearing cut-out designs of a star, a question mark and an exclamation point; a jazzman's goatee; a faint forehead scar from a hatchet accident as a kid; and, on one forearm, a tattoo that reads &quot;To My Dead Homies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it brings him to a picturesque, brick-and-ivy Midwestern college campus with a preppy reputation and an often-conservative outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, in the end it became the storybook tale of the full-fledged embrace between Devin Davis and Miami University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad we found each other,&quot; the now-38-year-old Davis said the other day as he walked into Millett Hall, where a large photo of him hangs in the school's Athletic Hall of Fame gallery in the arena's foyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis had just come from the new business venture he has launched in Oxford, a place he now calls his second home after a 16-year pro career that spanned the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bouquet of dreadlocks is now gone, as is the golden grillwork, replaced by a white-toothed smile that shows itself often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wore a red T-shirt - printed up specially that day by his pals at Lebowski Tees and Design - that trumpeted his company, Oxford Mobile Hand Car Wash, and the promise: &quot;Let the Detail Crew Come to You.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The customer calls us and we go to their home, their business, even if they're at the golf course, wherever their car is, and we clean it inside and out,&quot; Davis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the process, he leaves you with more than just a polished vehicle. You get a refreshing glimpse of what can happen when people who seem to have little in common open their minds and their arms and find acceptance, understanding and even brotherhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, that wasn't how it started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh no,&quot; Davis said with a laugh. &quot;That first year or two I was here, if you had told me this was where I'd end up, I'd have said you were crazy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Totally crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culture shock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davis grew up in Miami's Overtown section, a tough-edged, inner-city neighborhood known for its continuing crime problems, its deadly riots and for having one of the highest poverty rates in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He starred at Miami Senior High, a large, multi-ethnic basketball powerhouse in the city, but said some colleges shied away from him because of his background or his look. That group includes a coach from George Washington University who told him he would have to cut his hair if he was going to play for the Colonials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He came to Oxford on a recruiting trip in 1993 with prep teammate Puncho Farquharson and both agreed to play for then-head coach Herb Sendek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But soon after he moved onto campus, the 6-foot-7 Davis - whose size and look drew everyone's attention - began wondering what he had gotten himself into.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I swear to God, before I ever stepped foot on the court and people knew I was a basketball player, I literally saw people come towards me on the sidewalk and suddenly cross the street rather than pass me,&quot; he said with a laugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The dreads, the gold teeth, they had never seen anything like me. It wasn't so much I was a bad guy. I was just different than a lot of people here. And to be honest, a lot of it was just as strange for me. There is no place like Oxford where I come from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All my life I had lived in a minority area: the ghetto, poverty, drugs, killin'... I can remember back to the last riot (1989), I was like ninth grade. I remember the guy next door coming out and shooting up at the (police) helicopters. It was crazy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the little stuff, the things I liked to do or listen to, it was all different. It was just a culture shock for me and in the beginning I struggled with it. I couldn't wait to get out of here. I was going to transfer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then basketball started and though he had some bumpy times with Sendek, an intense coach known for X-and-O brilliance but not a warm-fuzzy nature, he found himself in the starting lineup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I just tried to stay focused and do what I had to do,&quot; Davis said. &quot;I had come to school with a mission. Basketball was gonna take me somewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn't that good when I got here. I was just a rebounder and a defensive player, but for some reason God blessed me with that grind, that motor, to give it all I had on the court and I got better and better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And here I was just a freshman, playing 30 minutes a game, averaging 10 (points) and seven (rebounds), so in terms of basketball, I was happy. How could I be mad? How could I leave?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farquharson wasn't getting to play much and after a season, he left for Tampa University. Davis, meanwhile, stayed and began to settle in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His teammate - and roommate - was Jermaine Henderson, and they became like brothers. And around campus he said some of the black professors reached out to him, none more so than the late Joe Cox, the art professor and assistant provost who had once played basketball for Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coach Charlie Coles, whom Sendek hired as an assistant before Davis' sophomore season, became another confidante and would end up a lifelong friend, as would Cox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many students embraced him, as well, and some started showing up at games wearing black, mop-top wigs that mimicked his hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most popular T-shirts on campus featured a dreadlocked basketball wearing sunglasses. On the back it said: &quot;We've got a dreadlock on the MAC.&quot; Later the school would put out a poster of Davis sitting in a barber's chair. The message: &quot;Miami basketball: A hair-raising experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1994 NCAA tournament, Davis scored 24 points and grabbed 15 rebounds as Miami upset nationally ranked Arizona at UD Arena. Afterward, Wildcats center Joseph Blair gushed: &quot;Damn, that guy with hair ... he can play&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran coach Lute Olson agreed: &quot;The way Davis plays the game, he lifts that whole team to another level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his four years at Miami, the latter two paired with Wally Szczerbiak, Davis helped Miami make two NCAA tournaments and play in the NIT twice. He was an All-Mid-American Conference first-team selection three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ended his career as the third-leading scorer (1,828 points) and third-leading rebounder (1,027) in RedHawks history. He's among the top 10 in 13 career categories, including blocked shots, steals and starts (114).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the best-known and most-beloved players to wear a Miami uniform, he was inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what, I ended up a guy who'll always be in the history books here,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;That journey - to make it out of Overtown and end up in the Hall of Fame here - is pretty special to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeing the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Miami and a brief stint in the Continental Basketball Association, Davis headed to Lugo, Spain, to play professionally. Once again it was a culture shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he played his first game, he watched a tape of the rival big man, Joventut Badalona's burly 6-foot-9, 255-pound Tanoka Beard, with wide-eyed disbelief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bulky guy fouled out and he started yelling at the refs,&quot; Davis said with a grin. &quot;The next thing, he grabs the front of his shirt and rips it off like he was the Incredible Hulk. I sat there thinking, 'What is this?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another time we go to play Huelva (in Andalucia) and we come out of the locker room and everyone in the arena is smoking. You're coughing in a gym full of smoke and I just thought, 'Oh my God.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just like when he came to Oxford, Davis said he focused on the task at hand: &quot;I was there for business - to take care of my family - and nothing was going to stop me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it didn't. He played nearly 10 years for various teams in Spain and got to love the country, so much that he now has dual citizenship. He also played in the Philippines and for teams in St. Petersburg, Russia; Mexico; Uruguay; and two teams in Argentina, most recently for a club in Bahia Blanca in the Buenos Aires province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When that season ended in March, he had surgery to &quot;clean up&quot; his left knee. By his count that was the seventh operation of his hoops career. He'll be 39 in December and whether he plays again this coming season depends on his knee, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If his basketball is finally over, he said he can accept it: &quot;It got me an education. I saw the world, made some money, was able to take care of my family and meet a lot of people. And along with that I was able to show people it was possible to come from where I did and get an opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he still lives part-time in Miami - he has a 17-year-old daughter there, as well as his mother and other family members - he gravitated to Oxford after his surgery. He used to come back regularly in the offseason to spend time with his friends, especially Cox and Coles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of those mentors died this year - the 73-year-old Cox in January and the 71-year-old Coles last month - and losing them has been unsettling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Oxford for Coles' funeral, Davis decided to launch the mobile car wash business - telephone 513-461-1405 - that serves not only Oxford, but surrounding cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the end of August I hope to get an individual development camp for kids started, too,&quot; he said. &quot;I think I can help them with basketball drills and I think I've got something to tell them, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why he's doing all this here - before doing it in Florida - is simple, he said: &quot;I enjoy my school and the town. It became my home away from home. People accepted me and it all just worked. We learned from each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we hadn't found each other, if I had ended up somewhere else, who knows what my life might be. I might not be standing here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 14--Two Fayetteville community watch coordinators said Saturday they agree with the not guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. But two civic leaders disagree with the outcome of the racially charged case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community watch coordinators said Zimmerman, 29, acted in self-defense when he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla., last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Popp, 47, who coordinates the Kornbow neighborhood watch, said he was not surprised by the verdict after watching the trial last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really didn't know how the prosecutors could have thought they were going to win this,&quot; Popp said. &quot;Most of the prosecutor's witnesses made the defense's case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kornbow is next to Bonnie Doone, off Bragg Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gena Johnson, 61, who leads the community watch in the B Street area, said the verdict seems fair. The neighborhood off Person Street is plagued by drug dealing and prostitution in broad daylight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate to see anybody killed,&quot; she said. &quot;But from what I can remember, Zimmerman had injuries to his head ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two black civic leaders, however, criticized the verdict, saying Zimmerman should have been held liable for the teenager's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Buxton, the 66-year-old president of the Fayetteville branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he thought Zimmerman should have been found guilty of the lesser manslaughter charge. Buxton was critical of the prosecution for not presenting a more convincing case to the six-member jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anytime a young man is walking home, innocent, and gunned down, just by walking home, and (Zimmerman) just gets off scot free, that is something he will have to answer to one day,&quot; Buxton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors claimed Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, was profiling Martin, who was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troy Williams, a talk show host on WIDU-1600 AM radio, was disappointed by the verdict. The case received plenty of air time on the gospel station, which attracts a mostly black audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even in the 21st century, justice continues to be an elusive commodity for African-Americans,&quot; said Williams, a 57-year-old former sheriff's deputy. &quot;Accountability is the issue, and in this case, the criminal justice system has again failed an important segment of American society.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times-Union readers want to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I received an email with a photo of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin that says that &quot;little Trayvon&quot; at the time of his death stood almost 6-foot-2 and weighed 175 muscular pounds. Why did the media continue to show photos of the innocent-looking 12-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin instead of current ones?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of viral emails purport to show photos of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com and TruthorFiction.com all looked into the images, as did other news organizations, and came to the same conclusion: Not the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One email, headlined &quot;Media Bias,&quot; shows a smiling, clean-cut, suit-wearing George Zimmerman - who shot Martin - next to a photo identified as Martin in saggy pants and making obscene gestures with both hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That email came from a posting on Twitchy.com, a website started by conservative columnist Michelle Malkin. The photo of Martin, though, was of a totally different Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, or someone who created a Facebook page with that name, according to various fact-finding groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitchy.com did post a correction, which said, &quot;We made a mistake. The photo on the right is not of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin who was shot by Zimmerman. We apologize to our readers and the Martin family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The email also castigated the media for using a &quot;5-year-old&quot; photo of a smiling Martin wearing a red Hollister T-shirt. That photo, according to Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump, was taken in August 2011, seven months before Martin died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also posting supposed images of Martin was the website Stormfront, a neo-Nazi forum that describes itself as a &quot;community of racial realists and idealists.&quot; Business Insider picked up one of those &quot;gangsta&quot; images, then had to quickly retract and correct it, Columbia Journalism Review reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another viral email that has filled area inboxes over the past year has as its centerpiece a photo identified as Martin. The photo is of a young man with facial hair who is heavily tattooed. The email accuses the media of deceiving the public by using photos of a younger Martin, not detailing alleged disciplinary problems that Martin had in school and wanting to depict him as a &quot;sweet kid&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't show the up-to-date pictures of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in the media. Now you know why. Kinda scary, ain't it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not Martin, but a photo of Jayceon Terrell Taylor, a rapper from California who also goes by &quot;Game&quot; (formerly, &quot;The Game&quot;). Game received Grammy nominations in 2006 for his collaboration with rapper 50 Cent on &quot;Hate It or Love It,&quot; PolitiFact.com reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photo of Game was used in a May 6, 2010, story for XXL magazine, The Washington Post reported. Game was 31 years old at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TruthorFiction.com compared the tattoos in the photo with those on Game's album cover &quot;Leftovers,&quot; and found them to be the same. The fact-checking organizations wrote that Game was very outspoken about the shooting and was quoted in several articles accompanied by his photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is possible that the originator of the chain email included the wrong photo on purpose, just as it is conceivable that the originator, seeing the photo of Game with an article on Martin, could have - in a quick read - confused one for the other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Request for clarification from panel of six women suggests verdict in case of killing of Trayvon Martin may arrive soon <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury deciding the fate of George Zimmerman, the Florida neighbourhood watch leader charged with the second-degree murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, hinted on Saturday evening that it was close to reaching a verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel of six women trying the case at the Seminole County criminal justice centre sent a note to Judge Debra S Nelson late on their second day of deliberations asking for further clarification of the instructions given to them for the charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no explanation why they were asking the question, but it suggested the jurors had moved on from sifting through the three weeks of evidence presented to them at the trial and were considering their final decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To secure a conviction for second-degree murder, prosecutors needed to prove that Zimmerman, 29, acted with ill will, spite or hatred when he shot and killed the 17-year-old Martin in a violent confrontation at Sanford's Retreat at Twin Lakes gated community on 26 February last year. The charge carries a penalty of at least 25 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prove the lesser charge of manslaughter, the state's attorneys needed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he intentionally committed an act that caused Martin's death and that the killing was not justified or excusable. In Florida, manslaughter involving a firearm is punishable with a sentence of between 10 and 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the approval of Nelson, state attorney Bernie de la Rionda and lead defence lawyer Mark O'Mara sent a note back to the jury room saying that the court could not engage in general discussions but might be able to address a specific question regarding clarification if the jury wished to submit one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson told the court that the jury had ordered dinner to be sent in to them, suggesting they planned to continue working well into the evening, having already spent 10 hours on Saturday locked in discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who admits killing Martin but denies murder on the grounds of self-defence, remained outside the courtroom for most of the day, in a separate room from Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, the dead youth's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, police stepped in to remove a vocal protester from a gathering of Martin family supporters and a smaller group proclaiming Zimmerman's innocence. Dozens of demonstrators, many carrying Justice for Trayvon banners, turned up during the day and their protests remained largely peaceful as they sang gospel songs and chanted Martin's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson issued a public appeal for calm. Reverend Jackson was one of those who led peaceful protests in Sanford and elsewhere soon after the shooting on 26 February last year, when Zimmerman was originally released without charge. Speaking at a peace rally in Chicago, and in a series of tweets, Jackson said the public reaction to the verdict, whichever way it goes, needs to be tempered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Zimmerman is convicted, there should not be inappropriate celebrations because a young man lost his life,&quot; he said. &quot;If Zimmerman is not convicted, avoid violence, because it only leads to more tragedies. Self-destruction is not the road to reconstruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's family also released a statement calling for restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors heard from 56 witnesses in 12 days, although Zimmerman did not testify in his own defence. O'Mara told them that Zimmerman was forced to fire to save his own life after Martin broke his nose with &quot;a sucker punch&quot; and smashed his head on a concrete pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors portrayed Zimmerman as an angry vigilante who wrongly assumed that the hoodie-wearing Martin was a criminal and was &quot;up to no good&quot; as he walked home to the house of his father's fiancee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case brought issues of race, Florida's controversial gun laws and the right of a person to stand their ground into sharp focus. A special prosecutor, Angela Corey, charged Zimmerman with murder six weeks after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It emerged on Saturday that Corey had fired Ben Kruidbos, the IT director of the state attorney's office who testified at a pre-trial hearing last month that prosecutors had withheld from the defence photographs and text messages he recovered from Martin's mobile phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos received a hand-delivered letter at his house on Friday accusing him of &quot;deliberate, wilful and unscrupulous actions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your egregious lack of regard for the sensitive nature of the information handled by this office is completely abhorrent. You have proven to be completely untrustworthy,&quot; Cheryl Peek, the managing director of the state attorney's office, wrote in the letter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman walked free from a Florida courtroom late on Saturday after a jury acquitted the neighbourhood watch leader of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, in a violent encounter at his gated housing development 17 months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, smiled briefly and shook the hands of his lawyers Mark O'Mara and Don West after the verdict from the jury of six women was read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, the parents of the 17-year-old whom Zimmerman shot and killed on the night of 26 February last year, were not in court to hear the decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unanimous verdict accepting Zimmerman's argument that he shot Martin in self-defence came after more than 16 hours of deliberations by the panel at the Seminole County criminal justice centre in Sanford. They had sifted through the testimony of 56 witnesses and hours of closing arguments presented by lawyers from both sides during the three-week trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have no further business with this court,&quot; Judge Debra Nelson told Zimmerman, informing him that he was free to go and that his GPS tracking bracelet would be removed. Zimmerman's wife Shellie broke down in tears and sobbed into a pink scarf, then beamed widely as she hugged her husband's parents, Robert and Gladys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal was greeted with cheers and angry shouts outside the courthouse, where dozens of banner-carrying supporters of the Martin family had gathered through the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police stepped in to remove a vocal protestor from the gathering but the protests remained largely peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teams of officers from the Sanford police department and the Seminole County sheriff's office kept a close eye on the demonstrators, who included a smaller number calling for Zimmerman to be found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said the verdict reflected a weak, circumstantial case put by the prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were able to have a fair hearing and an open trial but this is not a time for jubilance, it's a time for reflection,&quot; said Mark NeJame, a prominent Orlando attorney who turned down the chance to represent Zimmerman last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A young man is dead. This is just a tragedy and we need to figure out a way to do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who was released without charge on the night of the shooting, was arrested in April last year, 44 days after the shooting, when Florida's governor, Rick Scott, appointed a special prosecutor to re-examine the circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, who lived in Miami, was walking back to the house of his father's fianc&eacute;e at the Retreat at Twin Lakes gated community carrying a soft drink and sweets he had bought at a local convenience store. Zimmerman, who worked as a mortgage underwriter, said he spotted the hoodie-wearing youth as he was on his way to buy groceries, then called police to report a &quot;suspicious male&quot;. Somehow, the two ended up in a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case hinged on the conflicting testimony of witnesses and the key issue of whose screams were heard on a recording of a 911 call made by one of Zimmerman's neighbours, which also captured the fatal shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother, father and brother all testified that they were certain it was the teenager who was pleading for his life. Zimmerman's parents and a numbers of friends and neighbours took the stand to insist that it was Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The earlier call, made to a non-emergency police line by Zimmerman, caught the defendant using profanities that were repeated by the prosecution to try to show he acted with spite, ill-will and hatred, the benchmarks for a second-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fucking punks. These assholes, they always get away,&quot; assistant state attorney John Guy said as he began his opening argument on the first day of the trial. &quot;Those were the words in that grown man's mouth as he followed in the dark a 17-year-old boy that he didn't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He concluded by telling the jury: &quot;George Zimmerman did not shoot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he had to. He shot him for the worst of all reasons, because he wanted to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead attorney, worked hard to counter the state's portrayal of his client as an overzealous, angry vigilante who was &quot;fed up&quot; after a series of burglaries and who became a self-appointed guardian of the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not one witness to suggest that the guy is who they want you to believe he is, that neighbourhood watch cop wannabe crazy rider walking the neighbourhood looking for someone to harass,&quot; O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he argued, Martin was the aggressor, emerging from the darkness to break Zimmerman's nose with a sucker punch and smashing his head on a concrete pavement, forcing him to fire the single shot from his 9mm semi-automatic pistol to save his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He used a number of props to make his points, including a life-size mannequin that he wrestled with theatrically on the courtroom floor and a slab of cement he dumped in front of the jury box to represent the &quot;weapon&quot; he said Martin used, proving he was not unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara insisted Zimmerman had not disobeyed the police dispatcher's instruction not to follow Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow defence attorney West proved the most colourful and controversial character during the trial, opening his case with a questionable knock-knock joke about Zimmerman's notoriety and clashing frequently with the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also appeared in a photograph posted to Instagram by his daughter Molly showing the family enjoying a &quot;celebration&quot; ice cream after opening statements. The accompanying caption &quot;we beat stupidity&quot; and hashtag #dadkilledit prompted the state attorney's office to demand an inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal proceedings are still active against Zimmerman's wife. Shellie Zimmerman faces a perjury charge for alleging lying at her husband's bail hearing last summer over the state of the couple's finances, pleading poverty soon after they raised $130,000 through donations to his online defence fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara has said that fighting the murder charge effectively bankrupted the couple, who have relied on friends for food and clothes for Zimmerman to wear at his trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues of race and gun law came to the fore thanks to civil rights leaders, protests and the influence of social media <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin so nearly went to his grave unnoticed, his death barely recorded among the grim statistics of gun violence involving African American youths. Initially, after the 17-year-old was killed on 26 February 2012, as he was walking unarmed on a side street in a gated community in Sanford, central Florida, the incident attracted virtually no attention outside the local press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the determination of his parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, combined with the amplifying echo-chamber of social media, turned an hitherto unnoted death into a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre. Their call for the man who shot their son with a 9mm pistol, the then 28-year-old neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman, to be held accountable transformed the shooting into a litmus test of justice in America today. It put the country's proliferating &quot;stand your ground&quot; gun laws, racial profiling and discrimination against black young men - as well as police incompetence - in the dock. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 March, Martin's parents launched a petition on change.org, complaining that Zimmerman had been released without charge and calling on the local district attorney to investigate. The petition went viral, attracting within days more than two million signatures, a record for the campaigns website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the petition, a storm gathered. Protests were staged across Florida and around America, the crowds sporting hoodies and eating Skittles sweets, just as the teenager had the evening he died. Those seasoned civil rights activists, the reverends Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, descended on Sanford, and the furore reached as high as the White House, where President Obama lamented that &quot;If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billowing controversy put a spotlight on the state of law enforcement locally and nationally. Locally, the police chief handling the case, Bill Lee, came under pressure for having appeared to run a less than robust investigation into the shooting. Lee allowed Zimmerman to walk free, stating publicly that there was insufficient evidence to show he did not act in self-defence. Despite the efforts of the Sanford city authorities to protect him, Lee was forced out in June last year, by which time a special prosecutor had issued charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race aggravated the picture, with influential groups such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People calling for a review of the local police force's conduct, claiming that the investigation was racially-biased in a way that compounded the initial racial component of the teenager's death. Supporters of Zimmerman countered that he is Hispanic, and that race didn't come into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally, the shooting drew attention to a plethora of local &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws that have expanded the power of gun owners by extending their right not to retreat from a threat out of their homes and into public places. More than 20 states had adopted such laws, Florida among the first and most enthusiastically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that of 200 cases in which Florida's stand your ground law was invoked, almost 70% of the accused had gone free. The accused were much more likely to face no penalty if a black person had been killed (73%) than if a white person had been killed (59%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the incidents explored by the newspaper, almost a third involved defendants who initiated the fight, shot an unarmed person or pursued their victim - and still went unpunished. Some were released having shot their victims in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the shockwaves of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting reverberated far beyond Florida's shores, they caught off guard some very prominent entities - notably, the National Rifle Association, the nation's most powerful pro-gun lobby group, which has been a staunch advocate of stand your ground laws. The NRA's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, tried to deflect criticism from his own organisation by accusing the media of exaggerating what had happened in Sanford. &quot;You don't care about the truth, and the truth is the national news media in this country is a national disgrace,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, for the first time in many years, the NRA was put on the defensive. It was a precursor, perhaps, for the battering the lobbying group was to face after the Newtown school shooting a few months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the outcome, the trial of George Zimmerman for second-degree murder was largely stripped of many of these fundamental and searing elements. Lawyers spent three weeks appearing to tread carefully around the issues of race, the social backgrounds of the victim and defendant, and Florida's controversial gun laws. Some of that was court ordered. Judge Debra Nelson rejected a series of pre-trial motions from both sides, excluding certain evidence or descriptions from being introduced, such as photographs showing Martin apparently smoking marijuana, or any hint that Zimmerman had racially profiled the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, overwhelmingly, the attorneys chose to make the trial legally and procedurally straightforward, relying on the evidence and conflicting statements of eyewitness and experts, especially the forensic analysis of Zimmerman's alleged injuries, to try to prove their points. What little emotion was on display came mostly outside the witness box, such as when Martin's parents walked out during particularly graphic testimony or when Zimmerman appeared to tear up when John Donnelly, a close friend, spoke of his dedication to the community in glowing terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Zimmerman suspected Martin of being a criminal because he was black was never suggested in three weeks of testimony; Martin's size, weight, demeanour and attire - that now famous hooded top - were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, the defence sought to portray Zimmerman's perceived guardianship of his gated community purely in terms of service to its residents, rather than masking any deep-seated or previously held resentment for suspicious outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers watching the trial in a vacuum would have seen a basic to-and-fro over the physical evidence and the issues of self-defence and the right to stand your ground. They would have been largely oblivious to the wider civil rights and social controversies surrounding it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the facts of Trayvon Martin's death came out in court, but the jury system must be respected, lawyers say <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor who charged George Zimmerman last year has defended her decision to bring a murder case against him, and praised the state attorneys who presented it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We promised that we would seek the truth for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and due process for George Zimmerman, that we get all the facts and details of this very difficult case before a jury, and we chose to do it that way because we felt everyone had a right to know everything about this case,&quot; special prosecutor Angela Corey said in a courthouse press conference minutes after the verdict was read. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a case like this to come out in bits and pieces served no good to no one. As [assistant state attorney John] Guy told the jury yesterday, to the dead we owe respect, to the living we owe the truth. We have been respectful to the living, we have done our best to bring due process to all involved and we believe we have brought out the truth on behalf of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey defended the introduction of the &quot;lesser included&quot; charge of manslaughter, which gave the jury another option to hold Zimmerman responsible for Martin's death if they did not believe he was guilty of murder, and which could have led to a 30-year jail sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We charge what we believe we can prove,&quot; she said. &quot;That's why we charged second-degree murder. We truly believe that the mindset of George Zimmerman and the words that he used and the reason he was out doing what he was doing fit the bill for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case has never been about race, nor has it ever been about the right to bear arms, not in the sense of prosecuting this as a criminal case. But Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was profiled, there's no doubt he was profiled to be a criminal. This case was about boundaries and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernie de la Rionda, the state's lead attorney, said: &quot;We live in a great country that has a great criminal justice system. It's not perfect but it's the best in the world and we respect the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've tried 300 and something cases, about 80 murder cases and this is only the second murder case that I've lost. Am I disappointed? Yes, because I thought he was guilty. But what matters is what the jury said and I accept it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow prosecutor Richard Mantei praised the &quot;dignity&quot; shown by Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, throughout the legal process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been dignified and shown class, they've kept their pain in check when they needed to and grieved when they needed to, and handled it as ladies and gentlemen,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for calm after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin are empty words for black families <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let it be noted that on this day, Saturday 13 July 2013, it was still deemed legal in the US to chase and then shoot dead an unarmed young black man on his way home from the store because you didn't like the look of him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year was tragic. But in the age of Obama the acquittal of George Zimmerman offers at least that clarity. For the salient facts in this case were not in dispute. On 26 February 2012 Martin was on his way home, minding his own business armed only with a can of iced tea and a bag of Skittles. Zimmerman pursued him, armed with a 9mm handgun, believing him to be a criminal. Martin resisted. They fought. Zimmerman shot him dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who screamed. Who was stronger. Who called whom what and when and why are all details to warm the heart of a cable news producer with 24 hours to fill. Strip them all away and the truth remains that Martin's heart would still be beating if Zimmerman had not chased him down and shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt about who the aggressor was here. The only reason the two interacted at all, physically or otherwise, is that Zimmerman believed it was his civic duty to apprehend an innocent teenager who caused suspicion by his existence alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeals for calm in the wake of such a verdict raise the question of what calm there can possibly be in a place where such a verdict is possible. Parents of black boys are not likely to feel calm. Partners of black men are not likely to feel calm. Children with black fathers are not likely to feel calm. Those who now fear violent social disorder must ask themselves whose interests are served by a violent social order in which young black men can be thus slain and discarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the acquittal was shameful it was not a shock. It took more than six weeks after Martin's death for Zimmerman to be arrested and only then after massive pressure both nationally and locally. Those who dismissed this as a political trial (a peculiar accusation in the summer of Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden) should bear in mind that it was politics that made this case controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charging Zimmerman should have been a no-brainer. He was not initially charged because Florida has a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law whereby deadly force is permitted if the person &quot;reasonably believes&quot; it is necessary to protect their own life, the life of another or to prevent a forcible felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since it was Zimmerman who stalked Martin, the question remains: what ground is a young black man entitled to and on what grounds may he defend himself? What version of events is there for that night in which Martin gets away with his life? Or is it open season on black boys after dark?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's not guilty verdict will be contested for years to come. But he passed judgement on Trayvon that night summarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fucking punks,&quot; Zimmerman told the police dispatcher that night. &quot;These assholes. They always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So true it's painful. And so predictable it hurts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and family fear for Zimmerman's safety despite his acquittal of the murder of Trayvon Martin by a six-person jury <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, acquitted of murder by a Florida jury, will never again be free to live a normal life, according to family and friends who spoke of their fears for his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from a wrongful death suit from Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family that will likely see the neigbourhood watch leader back in court to defend himself, Zimmerman will feel the shadow of the case hanging over him forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly he's a free man in the eyes of the court, but he's going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; said Robert Zimmerman Jr, George's brother, who has acted as the family's spokesman since the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are factions, there are groups, there are people that would want to take the law into their own hands or be vigilantes in some sense if they think that justice was not served. They won't respect a verdict no matter how it was reached and they will always present a threat to George and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has always feared for his safety, we have always feared for his safety and our safety as a family,&quot; he added in an interview with CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Saturday's not guilty verdict will almost certainly not see an end to Zimmerman's legal battles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead attorney, has promised to fight and defeat the wrongful death suit that will be presented in a civil court on some unspecified future date. It carries a lower burden of proof than the criminal charge the Sanford jury rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until then, O'Mara said, Zimmerman will probably remain in hiding, possibly outside Florida, as he and his wife Shellie have been ever since he was freed on bail in June 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wears a bulletproof vest, has not worked since the shooting and is relying on the generosity of family and friends since being effectively bankrupted by the case, O'Mara has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shellie Zimmerman still faces a perjury trial for allegedly lying at her husband's bail hearing last summer over the state of the couple's finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also remains a possibility that Zimmerman could face another criminal trial over the Martin shooting, with the Department of Justice already known to have been contacted by civil rights groups over the possibility of pursuing a federal hate crime charge against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows complaints by some African American leaders over the decision by prosecutors in the trial not to pursue a line that would have tried to paint Zimmerman as someone who targeted Martin due to the teenager's race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state's attorney avoided the issue of race, the defence team denied the issue of race - yet racial profiling was obvious from the very beginning,&quot; said Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who led peaceful protests in Sanford last year when Zimmerman was originally released without charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of this conclusion you look at all-white people doing the offence and defence, you look at the jury without a black person or without a man on it, instead of a jury of Trayvon's peers. The Department of Justice must intervene to take this case to another layer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, however, have blamed black leadership for the &quot;failure&quot; to deliver justice to Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The call for an inquiry should have been made before or during the trial,&quot; said Dr Vibert White, a human rights activist and professor at the University of Central Florida who has lectured on the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows their ineptness and lack of creativity in developing a strategy to deal with the plague of bigotry and racism that exists in Florida and elsewhere. If you go just by the results, there's no clear evidence that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's civil rights were violated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, he added, jurors sent &quot;a subtle message&quot; with their verdict. &quot;We live in a state where seven out of 10 people carry guns ... there's a culture that believes African Americans, Latinos, Haitians, are thugs, and that [people] need to be protected. I believe many on the jury thought overwhelmingly that Zimmerman was performing an act of social good.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders in the US expressed &quot;outrage&quot; Sunday over the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, demanding that authorities pursue a federal civil rights case against the teenager's killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) - the US's largest black advocacy group - said the case in which Zimmerman, who is of mixed white-Hispanic parentage, followed then shot Martin dead met the benchmark for an inquiry by the Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the jury in Sanford, Florida, accepted Zimmerman's argument that he acted in self-defence when he killed Martin on 26 February last year, he was caught on a recording of a call to police using the words &quot;fucking punks&quot; and &quot;these assholes, they always get away.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you look at his comments and when you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighbourhood about how they felt especially targeted by him, there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,&quot; Jealous said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous released a statement immediately after Saturday night's decision, which followed more than 16 hours of deliberations by the six-strong jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict. We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of stand-your-ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous said Sunday that he had spoken to &quot;senior members&quot; of attorney general Eric Holder's team and expressed hope they would continue the work of FBI investigators last summer who reviewed elements of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will review all that comes out in that, and then they will make a choice about whether or not they will pursue criminal civil rights charges,&quot; Jealous said in a CNN interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is in these types of cases where there are very serious questions, we know there will be a state phase, there will be a civil phase almost assuredly and then there will be a federal civil rights phase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining his outrage, Jealous said: &quot;We're upset with a situation in this country where as black people, as black parents, it feels so off that our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys, the robbers and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteers who think they're keeping folks safer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Justice has not commented on demands to launch a civil rights inquiry, but the advocacy group Judicial Watch released documents and an audio recording of an agency staff member from last year that it says shows the department actively supported the Justice for Trayvon campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama said Sunday that the death of Martin was a &quot;tragedy&quot; but added that the jury had now spoken and its decision should be met with calm reflection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the president said: &quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Sunday afternoon, Zimmerman's acquittal has not led to violent unrest, as some had initially feared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from a few incidents of window smashing and small street fires in Oakland, California, protests against the verdict were largely muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of peaceful rallies and church gatherings were held in Miami, Martin's home town, and in Sanford, one of them attended by Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton. Martin's parents were not in court on Saturday night to hear the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously they were devastated by the verdict itself but they are preparing to move forward,&quot; said Daryl Parks, the family's attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't allow this jury's decision to decide their move tomorrow. They'll move forward to defend the legacy of their son; they won't allow George Zimmerman's bullet to silence Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was always a possibility that this jury could do the unthinkable. Although we accept the verdict, we find it to be socially illogical and that's why so many people have outrage. No decent thinking person would ever believe that an armed person should ever be allowed to shoot an unarmed child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court officials said the six women members of the jury - five of them white and one Hispanic - wanted to protect their right of anonymity and had no immediate plans for media interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial case, which tapped into national debates about race, civil rights and the proliferation of guns, was decided on several key issues, not least whether Zimmerman acted in self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman did not testify during the three-week trial but his lawyers said Martin was the aggressor during the fatal confrontation, breaking his nose with &quot;a sucker punch&quot; and smashing his head on a concrete pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors sought to portray Zimmerman as an angry vigilante who was &quot;fed up&quot; after a series of burglaries at the Retreat at Twin Lakes gated community and who wrongly assumed that Martin, who was wearing a hooded top, was a criminal who was &quot;up to no good&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the not guilty verdict, Zimmerman will continue to be hounded by the case, members of his family have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life,&quot; the acquitted man's brother Robert Zimmerman Jr told CNN.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President says 'the death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy, but we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken' <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has called for &quot;calm reflection&quot; in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, noting that America was &quot;a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a &quot;tragedy&quot;, he suggested that it raised questions over whether enough was being done to &quot;stem the tide of gun violence&quot;. The statement made no reference to an alleged racial element to the killing, claims that some black leaders in the US are citing as they push the Department of Justice to launch a federal civil rights case against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has previously commented on the Martin death. In an emotional statement last March - at the height of furore surrounding the incident - Obama noted: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that occasion he suggested that all Americans needed to do &quot;some soul searching&quot; over how such an death could come about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, he echoed that earlier call for a period of reflection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In full, the statement read:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Thousands of demonstrators from across the country - chanting, praying and even fighting tears - protested a jury's decision to clear neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager while the Justice Department considered whether to file criminal civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallies on Sunday were largely peaceful as demonstrators voiced their support for 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family and decried Zimmerman's not guilty verdict as a miscarriage of justice. Police in Los Angeles said they arrested several people early Monday after about 80 protesters gathered in Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard and an unlawful assembly was declared. The New York Police Department said it arrested at least a dozen people on disorderly conduct charges during a rally in Times Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP and protesters called for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman, who was acquitted Saturday in Martin's February 2012 shooting death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STORY: Zimmerman Verdict: How the Sunday Morning Shows Covered </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said it is looking into the case to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal civil rights charges now that Zimmerman has been acquitted in the state case. The department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence generated during the federal probe is still being evaluated by the criminal section of the Justice Department's civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida, along with evidence and testimony from the state trial, the Justice Department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, President Barack Obama and religious and civil rights leaders urged calm in hopes of ensuring peaceful demonstrations following a case that became an emotional flash point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's demonstrations, held in cities from Florida to Wisconsin, attracted anywhere from a few dozen people to a more than a thousand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUEST COLUMN: Marcia Clark: Zimmerman Trial Shows How Media Improved Since O.J. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a march and rally in downtown Chicago attended by about 200 people, some said the verdict was symbolic of lingering racism in the United States. Seventy-three-year-old Maya Miller said the case reminded her of the 1955 slaying of Emmitt Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago who was murdered by a group of white men while visiting Mississippi. Till's killing galvanized the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty-eight years and nothing's changed,&quot; Miller said, pausing to join a chant for &quot;Justice for Trayvon, not one more.&quot; In New York City, more than a thousand people marched into Times Square on Sunday night, zigzagging through Manhattan's streets to avoid police lines. Sign-carrying marchers thronged the busy intersection, chanting &quot;Justice for! Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; as they made their way from Union Square, blocking traffic for more than an hour before moving on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Francisco and Los Angeles, where an earlier protest was dispersed with beanbag rounds, police closed streets as protesters marched Sunday to condemn Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti urged protesters to &quot;practice peace&quot; after the rock- and bottle-throwing incident. Later, more than 100 officers in riot gear converged on the crowd and ordered people to disperse. Police said they made seven arrests throughout the day, The Los Angeles Times reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rand Powdrill, 41, of San Leandro, Calif., said he came to the San Francisco march with about 400 others to &quot;protest the execution of an innocent black teenager.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If our voices can't be heard, then this is just going to keep going on,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUEST COLUMN: Douglas Rushkoff on Deen, Snowden, Zimmerman and the Culture of Contagion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, at Manhattan's Middle Collegiate Church, many congregants wore hooded sweatshirts - similar to the one Martin was wearing the night he was shot - in a show of solidarity. Hoodie-clad Jessica Nacinovich said she could only feel disappointment and sadness over the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure jurors did what they felt was right in accordance with the law but maybe the law is wrong, maybe society is wrong; there's a lot that needs fixing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a youth service in Sanford, Fla., where the trial was held, teens wearing shirts displaying Martin's picture wiped away tears during a sermon at the St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters also gathered in Atlanta, Miami, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., along with a host of other cities. In Miami, more than 200 people gathered for a vigil. &quot;You can't justify murder,&quot; read one poster. Another read &quot;Don't worry about more riots. Worry about more Zimmermans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Reitner, 76, of Miami, said she heard about the vigil through an announcement at her church Sunday morning. &quot;I was really devastated. It's really hard to believe that someone can take the life of someone else and walk out of court free,&quot; she said. In Philadelphia, about 700 protesters marched from LOVE Park to the Liberty Bell, alternating between chanting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's name and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope this will begin a movement to end discrimination against young black men,&quot; said Johnathan Cooper, one of the protest's organizers. &quot;And also to empower black people and get them involved in the system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, a crowd of about 75 protesters chanted and carried signs near Centennial Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I came out today because a great deal of injustice has been done and I'm very disappointed at our justice system; I'm just disappointed in America,&quot; said Tabatha Holley, 19, of Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, urged peace in the wake of the verdict. Jackson said the legal system &quot;failed justice,&quot; but violence isn't the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all the protesters heeded those calls immediately after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, Calif., during protests that began late Saturday night, some angry demonstrators broke windows, burned U.S. flags and started street fires. Some marchers also vandalized a police squad car and used spray paint to scrawl anti-police graffiti on roads and Alameda County's Davidson courthouse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey Weinstein may be the film industry's greatest master of publicity, but not even he could have planned for Fruitvale Station to open on the very weekend that George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale bears striking similarities to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin saga, raising the same issues of racial profiling and civil rights. The indie film could see increased interest in the weeks to come after a strong opening in seven theaters, including three in the San Francisco Bay Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From first-time director Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale recounts the shooting death of Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old African-American man who was killed by BART police officer Johannes Mehserle at Oakland's Fruitvale station in the early hours of Jan. 1, 2009. Like Martin, Grant was unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUNDANCE REVIEW: Fruitvale Station</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mehserle's conviction for involuntary manslaughter prompted criticism that justice wasn't served, much as Zimmerman's acquittal has sparked anger and some demonstrations. Coogler and actor Michael B. Jordan, who plays Grant in Fruitvale, both have spoken out about the Zimmerman case; reviewers also have addressed the parallels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, this event puts the movie in the public zeitgeist,&quot; Weinstein Co. president of distribution Erik Lomis said Sunday. &quot;I think it touches a public nerve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critically acclaimed film, a certain awards contender, won the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year before making its international premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale saw some of its biggest numbers at the Grand Lake Theater in Oakland, but it also saw keen interest at art-house theaters in New York and Los Angeles. Overall, the film played well across ethnic groups. Caucasians made up 43 percent of the those buying tickets, followed by African-Americans (29 percent), Hispanics (13 percent) and other groups (15 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUEST COLUMN: Douglas Rushkoff on Deen, Snowden, Zimmerman and the Culture of Contagion </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film goes into an additional six markets this coming Friday before expanding nationwide on July 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale is the second movie to find itself connected to the George Zimmerman/Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. Last year, 20th Century Fox was gearing up to promote its summer comedy Neighborhood Watch when Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot Martin in Sanford, Fla., alleging self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The studio quickly scaled back its marketing campaign and re-titled the film The Watch. The movie, about a group of neighborhood watch volunteers who discover aliens in their area, nose-dived at the summer 2012 box office. Fox insiders continue to believe that the comedy -- with a cast led by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn -- suffered because of its connection to real-life events.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beat by Despicable Me 2 and Adam Sandler's ensemble comedy Grown Ups 2, Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim failed to do monster business in its North American debut, posing a potential financial loss for Thomas Tull's Legendary Pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pacifc Rim opened to $38.3 million, a troubling number considering the movie's production budget of at least $190 million. Legendary footed most of the bill, with distribution and marketing partner Warner Bros. putting up a minority stake. Rolling out in its first 38 foreign markets, the 3D tentpole took in $53 million for a worldwide total of $91.3 million. While strong in Asia, Russia and Mexico, Pacific Rim was soft elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Universal's box office hit Despicable 2 stayed at No. 1 in its second weekend, grossing $44.8 million for a domestic total of $229.2 million. The 3D animated tentpole also came in No. 1 internationally, grossing $55.7 million from 50 markets for a worldwide total of $472.4 million. It has earned $243.2 million at the foreign box office and will eclipse the entire run of Despicable Me this week ($293 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despicable 2 topped the global box office for the weekend with $100.5 million in ticket sales; Pacific Rim followed with $91.3 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANALYSIS: What 'Pacific Rim's' Fate Means for Legendary and Warner Bros. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sony's Grown Ups 2 opened to a stellar $42.5 million domestically in a needed win for Sandler, who has had a string of box office disappointments. The sequel opened slightly ahead of the 2010 original, not accounting for inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're feeling great. It was a fairly competitive weekend and to gross more than the first film is great. The sequel played everywhere and to the whole family,&quot; said Sony worldwide president of distribution Rory Bruer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grown Ups 2 skewed slightly female (53 percent), while 54 percent of the audience was under 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite being ravaged by critics, Grown Ups 2 received a B- CinemaScore, same as the 2010 original. The sequel, costing a relatively modest $80 million to produce, reteams Sandler with Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Maya Rudolph and Maria Bello.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox's Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy comedy The Heat placed No. 4 in its third outing, jumping the $100 million mark and ending the weekend with a North American cume of $112.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming in No. 5 was Gore Verbinski's troubled The Lone Ranger, which tumbled a steep 61 percent to $11.1 million in its second weekend for a tepid domestic cume of $77.1 million. Overseas, the big-budget tentpole took in a meek $12.7 million from 33 territories for an international total of $48 million and worldwide cume of $119.1 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lone Ranger has a number of major markets in which to open, but box office observers and Wall Street anlaysts are predicting a major loss for Disney of between $150 million and $200 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless Pacific Rim does extraordinarily well overseas, or enjoys a huge multiple at the North American box office, it is also likely to result in a major loss for Legendary. The movie opens just as Legendary prepares to leave WB for its new co-financing and production deal with Legendary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marking del Toro's first big-budget tentpole, Pacific Rim pits giant robots against alien monsters and stars Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Day. The movie has received glowing reviews, while receiving an equally glowing A-CinemaScore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defying soft prerelease tracking, Pacific Rim got off to a better-than-expected start Thursday night and Friday, but once fanboy traffic started tapering off late Friday, the movie slowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WB waged an aggressive last-minute marketing effort, and the studio's president of domestic distribution Dan Fellman says it paid off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two weeks ago, we were looking at an opening of $25 million to $30 million,&quot; he said. &quot;This result is just what we've hoped for. There's nobody that doesn't like this movie, and it's Guillermo's biggest opening to date. Now, our job is broaden the base.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellman said the studio will accomplish this by airing ads that tout reviews and the audience CinemaScore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMAX theaters -- the favored venue for fanboys -- ponied up a robust $7.3 million in Pacific Rim ticket sales. In another sign that fanboys turned out in force, more than 50 percent of the overall gross came from 3D screens, a record for the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Younger moviegoers made up the biggest percentage of the audience for Pacific Rim, with 47 percent of those buying tickets under the age of 25 and 67 percent under the age of 35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseas, Pacific Rim launched to strong numbers in Asia, Russia and Mexico -- del Toro's home country -- but came in No. 3 in Australia behind fellow opener The Heat and Despicable Me 2. It came in No. 2 in the U.K. behind Monsters University, grossing $3.2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIDEO: 'Pacific Rim's' Guillermo del Toro on Box-Office Pressure, Planning a Sequel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far internationally, the tentpole is outpacing a slew of films that went on to gross between $300 million and $400 million overseas, including Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Clash of the Titans and Prometheus. It's also pacing on par with World War Z, which has earned more than $200 million to date at the foreign box office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Korea leads with $9.6 million, followed by Russia with $9.3 million. Mexico opened with $5.3 million, three times bigger than any of del Toro's previous films. On Monday, Pacific Rim is expected to surpass the lifetime gross of Pan's Labyrinth ($5.8 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pacific Rim only opened in 50 percent of the foreign marketplace and still has a number of major markets in which to open, including France, Germany, China, Spain and Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making headlines at the specialty box office in North America was The Weinstein Co.'s critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station, about the the shooting of a young African-American man by BART police in Oakland. The film -- opening just as George Zimmerman was acquitted of shooting Trayvon Martin -- grossed $377,285 from seven theaters for a location average of $53,898, the third best of the year so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale star Michael B. Jordan and first-time feature Ryan Coogler have been vocal in comparing the two shootings, and the issues they raise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox Searchlight's The Way, Way Back performed nicely as it expanded into a total of 79 theaters, grossing $1.1 million for a location average of $14,051 and cume of $1.8 million.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the trial of George Zimmerman took place about 2,500 miles away in Florida, the ripples of the controversial &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict for the man who fatally shot teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were felt in local communities over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do believe in our criminal justice system. However imperfect it is, it's still probably the best we have in the world,&quot; Assemblyman Curt Hagman, R-Chino Hills, said Sunday. &quot;I have faith that the jury knows far more than we do as far as the facts of the case and support whatever decision they came up with.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman trial just reaffirms what one Colton resident said is the everyday existence of black men in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The African-American community is used to being looked at differently in the eyes of the law,&quot; said Miles Whitehead, 71. &quot;You see, we live in different worlds. There's the black man's world and then there's everyone else's world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the roles were reversed and young Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had killed Zimmerman, there would be no controversy, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandson, who is a college student at Cal Poly Pomona, is pulled over by the police at least once a week,&quot; Whitehead said. &quot;He's a young black man that drives my old Mercedes Benz. The tags are always up to date and he is very insured, but he drives while being black in Pomona. Need I say more?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Brown, formerly the president of the Pasadena branch of the NAACP for 12 years, is disappointed in the Zimmerman verdict, but sees an opportunity in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Young people of all ethnic groups need to become more socially engaged in the legislative process,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe the young people now will become more galvanized and pay more attention now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, he'd like to see changes to laws like Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows people to use deadly force when they believe they're threatened, even when the option to leave the area exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is their era, this is their time, and this is what I believe the Martin family would want to see come out of this,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia community activist Ralph Walker questioned whether justice was served with the Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can you really just take someone's life and not serve any time?&quot; Walker said Sunday. &quot;But then you think about history and Emmett Till, and there was no justice there. And now you fast forward to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and there's no justice there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Till, a 14-year-old African-American, was killed in Mississippi in 1955 after he reportedly flirted with a white woman. The woman's husband and her half-brother, who later admitted to beating him and gouging out one of his eyes, were acquitted on charges of kidnapping and murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There would never have been a trial if the people hadn't demanded justice&quot; after Martin's killing, Walker said. &quot;Otherwise, this would have been another case that no one would have known anything about, down in the swamps of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker scoffed at those who downplay the racial aspect of the killing, subsequent trial and verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those who think it's over, it's not over. Race in America is always the elephant in the room that no one wants to bring up,&quot; he said. &quot;We're still engaged in a civil war, and if you think about it, when the president of the United States cannot get respect from the people he works with, how can Trayvon&nbsp;Martin?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense attorneys did a &quot;tremendous job&quot; leveraging prejudice against black men, according to Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He made the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin 'that black man, with the hood, who could be breaking into your house,'&quot; Walker said. &quot;So the fear of the black man, or the fear of a person of color, continues in America. It's that continuous story that still goes on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict has sent a chill through the African-American community, according to Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think every mother, every dad, who has an African-American son, is on alert: Know where they're going, because once they leave the house, they're not guaranteed to come home,&quot; he said. &quot;Thank God, I have three daughters.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous marches of varying sizes erupted in cities throughout Saturday night including San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta and Philadelphia, AFP reported. <BR>A jury in Sanford, Florida late Saturday found Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watchman, not guilty of shooting dead Martin, a 17 year-old unarmed teen on the night of February 26, 2012. <BR>The trial has riveted the nation for weeks, and emotions came to a boiling point as news of the verdict spread. <BR>Prominent rights activists like Jesse Jackson appealed for calm. <BR>&quot;Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies. Find a way for self construction not deconstruction in this time of despair,&quot; he wrote on Twitter. <BR>Martin's parents have long called for non-violent demonstrations, quoting civil rights icon Martin Luther King and the Bible. Several hundred demonstrators marched peacefully amid a heavy police presence in downtown San Francisco soon after the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) -- From New York to California, demonstrators outraged over the verdict in George Zimmerman's murder trial took to the streets and to church pulpits Sunday to speak out against his acquittal and to demand federal charges on civil rights violations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests were planned later Sunday in Boston, Detroit, Baltimore, San Francisco and other cities over the Florida case, which unleashed a national debate over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. At least one protest in California hours after the verdict late Saturday ended with vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhattan, congregants at Middle Collegiate Church were encouraged to wear hooded sweatshirts in the memory of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager who was wearing a hoodie the night he was shot to death in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Jacqueline Lewis, wearing a pink hoodie, urged peace and told her congregation that Martin Luther King Jr. &quot;would have wanted us to conduct ourselves on the highest plane of dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she added, &quot;we're going to raise our voices against the root causes of this kind of tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a youth service in Sanford, Fla., where the trial was held, teens wearing shirts displaying Martin's picture wiped away tears during a sermon at the St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after the verdict, demonstrators gathered on U Street in Washington, D.C., chanting, &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; One protester carried a sign that read, &quot;Stop criminalizing black men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, about 200 demonstrators marched through downtown Tallahassee carrying signs that said &quot;Racism is Not Dead&quot; and &quot;Who's Next?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chicago, black clergy members called for calm, with the Rev. Ira Acree of Greater St. John Bible Church saying the community should become &quot;a united voice for peace&quot; because it can't control the verdict but it &quot;can control our streets and communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, have urged peace. Jackson said the legal system &quot;failed justice,&quot; but violence isn't the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all the protesters heeded the leaders' call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Oakland, Calif., some angry demonstrators broke windows, burned U.S. flags and started street fires. Some marchers also vandalized a police squad car and used spray paint to scrawl anti-police graffiti on roads and on Alameda County's Davidson courthouse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager, igniting a national debate on racial profiling and civil rights, was found not guilty late Saturday night of second-degree murder. He was also acquitted of manslaughter, a lesser charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three weeks of testimony, the six-woman jury rejected the prosecution's contention that Mr. Zimmerman had deliberately pursued Mr. Martin because he assumed the hoodie-clad teenager was a criminal and instigated the fight that led to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman said he shot Mr. Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in self-defense after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him and slammed his head repeatedly against the sidewalk. In finding him not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the jury agreed that Mr. Zimmerman could have been justified in shooting Mr. Martin because he feared great bodily harm or death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury, which had been sequestered since June 24, deliberated 16 hours and 20 minutes over two days. The six female jurors entered the quiet, tense courtroom, several looking exhausted, their faces drawn and grim. After the verdict was read, each assented, one by one, quietly, their agreement with the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case began in the small city of Sanford as a routine homicide but soon evolved into a civil rights cause examining racial profiling and its consequences -- an issue barred from the courtroom -- and setting off a broad discussion of race relations in America. Mr. Martin, with his gray hooded sweatshirt and his Skittles -- the candy he was carrying -- became its catalyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Obama weighed in a month after the shooting, expressing sympathy for Mr. Martin's family and urging a thorough investigation. ''If I had a son,'' Mr. Obama said, ''he'd look like Trayvon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday night when the verdict was read, Mr. Zimmerman, 29, smiled slightly. His wife, Shellie, and several of his friends wept, and his parents kissed and embraced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who lost their son a few weeks after his 17th birthday, were not in the courtroom. In a statement released early Sunday, their attorney, Benjamin Crump, said the family was heartbroken, and that they thanked people around the world for their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trayvon&nbsp;Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till,'' he said, ''as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the verdict, Judge Debra S. Nelson of Seminole County Court, told Mr. Zimmerman, who has been in hiding and wears a bulletproof vest outside, that his bond was released and his GPS monitor would be cut off. ''You have no further business with the court,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, perhaps a hundred protesters who had been gathering through the night, their numbers building as the hours passed, began pumping their fists in the air, waving placards and chanting, ''No justice, no peace!'' Sheriff's deputies lined up inside the courthouse, watching the crowd, who were chanting peacefully, but intently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 11:20, more than an hour after the verdict had been read, the crowd outside the courtroom had begun to dwindle; fists were no longer aloft, placards had come down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the last of the protesters to leave the courthouse lawn was Mattie Aikens, 33, of Sanford. She had been standing outside since noon, holding a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona watermelon drink, which Mr. Martin was carrying the night he was shot. More than an hour after the verdict, she was still shocked. ''He should have went to prison,'' she said. ''He should have just got guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, one of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers, said, ''George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except firing the gun in self-defense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference following the verdict, Angela B. Corey, the state attorney who brought the charges, rebuffed the suggestion that her office overcharged Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We charged what we had based on the facts of the case,'' she said. ''We truly believe the mind-set of George Zimmerman and the reason he was doing what he did fit the bill for second-degree murder.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling it a ''very trying time,'' Mr. Crump said he had urged Mr. Martin's parents to stay out of the courtroom for the verdict. They were home and planning to attend church on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Crump asked the family's supporters keep the peace and read a Twitter post by Dr. Bernice King, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Whatever the Zimmerman verdict is,'' Mr. Crump read, ''in the words of my father, we must conduct ourselves on the higher plane of dignity and discipline.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford's new police chief, Cecil E. Smith, was in the courtroom for the verdict, and said afterward that while many calls were coming in from worried residents, the downtown was open and neighborhoods were calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there was anger over the verdict. ''We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,'' said Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P. ''We stand with Trayvon's family and we are called to act. We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Mara disputed the notion that Mr. Zimmerman engaged in racial profiling. ''His history was not as a racist,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that if Mr. Zimmerman was black, he likely would never have been charged. ''This became a focus for a civil rights event, which is a wonderful event to have,'' he said, ''but they decided George Zimmerman was to blame and to use as a civil rights violation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while defense lawyers were elated with the verdict, they also expressed anger that Mr. Zimmerman spent 16 months filled with fear and trauma when all he was doing was defending himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The prosecution of George Zimmerman was a disgrace,'' said Don West, one of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers. ''I am thrilled that this jury kept this tragedy from become a travesty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting brought attention to Florida's expansive self-defense laws. The laws allow someone with a reasonable fear of great bodily harm or death to use lethal force, even if retreating from danger is an option. In court, the gunman is given the benefit of the doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public outcry began after the police initially decided not to arrest Mr. Zimmerman, who is half-Peruvian, as they investigated the shooting. Mr. Martin, 17, had no criminal record and was on a snack run, returning to the house where he was staying as a guest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six weeks later, Mr. Zimmerman was arrested, but only after civil rights leaders championed the case and demonstrators, many wearing hoodies, marched in Sanford, Miami and elsewhere to demand action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Justice for Trayvon!'' they shouted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure prompted Gov. Rick Scott of Florida to remove local prosecutors from the case and appoint Ms. Corey, from Jacksonville. She ultimately charged Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder. The tumult also led to the firing of the Sanford police chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through it all, Mr. Martin's parents said they sought one thing: That Mr. Zimmerman have his day in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start of the trial, prosecutors faced a difficult task in proving second-degree murder. That charge required Mr. Zimmerman to have evinced a ''depraved mind,'' brimming with ill will, hatred, spite or evil intent, when he shot Mr. Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manslaughter, which under Florida law is typically added as a lesser charge if either side requests it, was a lower bar. Jurors needed to decide only that Mr. Zimmerman put himself in a situation that culminated in Mr. Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because of Florida's laws, prosecutors had to persuade jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Zimmerman did not act in self-defense. A shortage of evidence in the case made that a high hurdle, legal experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after three weeks of testimony, the fight between Mr. Martin and Mr. Zimmerman on that rainy night was a muddle, fodder for reasonable doubt. It remained unclear who had started it, who screamed for help, who threw the first punch and at what point Mr. Zimmerman drew his gun. There were no witnesses to the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state presented a case that was strong on guesswork and emotion but weak on evidence and proof, Mr. O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Don't connect those dots unless they are connected for you, beyond a reasonable doubt, by the state,'' he urged the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, prosecutors were left with Mr. Zimmerman's version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense also had one piece of irrefutable evidence, photographs of Mr. Zimmerman's injuries -- a bloody nose along with lumps and two cuts on his head. It indicated that there had been a fight and that Mr. Zimmerman had been harmed, and the defense showed them to the jury at every opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors built their case around Mr. Zimmerman's persona -- a ''wannabe cop'' -- his wrong assumptions and his words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, they said, was so concerned about burglaries in his townhouse complex that when he spotted Mr. Martin, an unfamiliar face in the rain, he immediately ''profiled'' him as a criminal. He picked up his phone and reported him to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he made the first in a string of bad choices, they said. He got out of the car with a gun on his waist; he disregarded a police dispatcher's advice not to follow Mr. Martin and he chased the teenager, engaged in a fight and shot him in the heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To stave off an arrest, he lied to the police, prosecutors said, embellishing his story to try to flesh out his self-defense claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Punks,'' Mr. Zimmerman said to the police dispatcher after he spotted Mr. Martin, adding a profanity. ''They always get away,'' he said at another point in the conversation, a reference to would-be burglars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On these words, prosecutors hung their case of ill will, hatred and spite toward Mr. Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This defendant was sick and tired of it,'' Bernie de la Rionda, the chief prosecutor, said in his closing statement. ''He was going to be what he wanted to be -- a police officer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no one saw the shooting; witnesses saw and heard only parts of the struggle, and provided conflicting accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there was not a ''shred of evidence'' that Mr. Zimmerman was not returning to his car when Mr. Martin ''pounced,'' defense lawyers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's witnesses did not always help their case. Rachel Jeantel, the 19-year-old who was talking with Mr. Martin on his cellphone shortly before he was shot, proved problematic. Her testimony was critical for the prosecution because she said that Mr. Martin was being followed by Mr. Zimmerman -- a ''creepy-ass cracker,'' he called him -- and that he was scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms. Jeantel might have damaged her credibility by acknowledging she had lied about her age and why she did not attend Mr. Martin's wake. She also testified that she softened her initial account of her chat with Mr. Martin for fear of upsetting Ms. Fulton, who sat next to her, weeping, during Ms. Jeantel's first interview with prosecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors also were not helped by the police and crime scene technicians, who made some mistakes in the case. Mr. Martin's sweatshirt, for example, was improperly bagged, which might have degraded DNA evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, police testimony boosts the state's case. Here, the chief police investigator, Chris Serino, told jurors that he believed Mr. Zimmerman, despite contradictions in his statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, prosecutors had emotion on their side -- the heart-wrenching narrative of a teenager ''minding his own business'' who was gunned down as he walked home with a pocketful of Skittles and a fruit drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That child had every right to do what he was doing, walking home,'' said John Guy, a prosecutor in the case. ''That child had every right to be afraid of a strange man following him, first in his car and then on foot. And did that child not have the right to defend himself from that strange man?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through it all, though, the defense chipped away at the prosecution's case. The resident with the best vantage point of the fight described a ''ground and pound'' fight, with a person in red or a light color on the bottom. Mr. Zimmerman wore a reddish jacket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a prominent forensic pathologist who is an expert in gunshot wounds testified that the trajectory of the bullet was consistent with Mr. Martin leaning over Mr. Zimmerman when the gun was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Let him go back,'' Mr. O'Mara said to the jury, referring to Mr. Zimmerman, ''and get back to his life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, the jury did just that.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- The jury in the trial of George Zimmerman held its second day of deliberations on Saturday, weighing whether Mr. Zimmerman's fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin constituted second-degree murder, manslaughter or self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the afternoon, after spending nearly eight hours in deliberations, the panel of six women sent a note to the judge asking for clarification on the manslaughter instructions. That led to a flurry of courtroom activity, with Judge Debra S. Nelson meeting with lawyers for both sides at the bench before ordering a 30-minute recess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the court reconvened, the prosecution and the defense lawyers asked for additional time to work together to come up with a written response to the jurors' query.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his three-hour closing argument on Friday, a lawyer for Mr. Zimmerman said that his client was guilty only of protecting his own life when he shot Mr. Martin, and he chastised the prosecution as having filled jurors' heads with guesswork, not evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, one of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers, told the jury that the prosecution had provided so little evidence of second-degree murder, the main charge, that he wished the verdict form contained three choices: ''guilty, not guilty, and completely innocent, because I would ask you to check that one.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing three weeks of testimony inside the Seminole County courthouse, the jury of six women -- five white and one Hispanic -- began deliberations at 2:29 p.m. Friday. They adjourned at 6 p.m. and resumed their work at 9 a.m. on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are to decide whether Mr. Zimmerman is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of second-degree murder or of the lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If jurors agree it was self-defense, Mr. Zimmerman will be found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Martin, 17, a unarmed black youth who was walking in the rain to a house where he was staying, was shot in the heart by Mr. Zimmerman. Mr. Zimmerman, then 28 and a neighborhood watch volunteer, said that Mr. Martin attacked him and that, fearing for his life, he shot the teenager. There were no witnesses to the shooting, which took place in darkness, shortly after 7 p.m. on Feb. 26, 2012. A six-week delay in charging Mr. Zimmerman stirred outrage, and civil rights leaders led marches in Sanford, Miami and elsewhere around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he spoke to the jury on Friday, Mr. O'Mara held up the defense's most compelling evidence in the case: photographs of Mr. Zimmerman's injured head and nose. And Mr. O'Mara walked the jury through an array of testimony and physical evidence suggesting Mr. Martin was on top during the struggle, which is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman's account to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But above all, Mr. O'Mara emphasized to jurors that a claim of self-defense does not require any injuries, only a reasonable fear of great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''No injuries are necessary to respond with deadly force,'' Mr. O'Mara said. ''Not a cut on a finger. The statute is clear. It requires a reasonable fear of bodily harm.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The injuries, he said, were ''icing on the cake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, on the floor in front of the jury, Mr. O'Mara placed a slab of concrete, similar to the pavement on which Mr. Martin repeatedly struck Mr. Zimmerman's head, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That is not an unarmed teenager with nothing but Skittles trying to get home,'' he said of Mr. Martin. Then he added, referring to the slab of concrete, ''The suggestion by the state that that's not a weapon, that that can't hurt somebody, that that can't cause great bodily harm, is disgusting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not Mr. Zimmerman who was the aggressor, he said. It was Mr. Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''You can't look at those pictures and say that what was visited upon George Zimmerman was not evidence of ill will, spite and hatred,'' Mr. O'Mara said, using legal terms that apply to the second-degree murder charge. Had Mr. Martin survived and been shot through the hip, Mr. O'Mara said, ''he would have been charged with aggravated battery, two counts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during the state's rebuttal argument, a prosecutor, John Guy, asked jurors to use their common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his heart, he said, Mr. Zimmerman harbored hatred and ill will toward Mr. Martin. To Mr. Zimmerman, Mr. Martin was not a teenager with Skittles in his pocket, chatting with his friend on the telephone, his hooded shirt shielding him from the rain. He was just another criminal casing the neighborhood, Mr. Guy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman's choices, he said, spoke volumes about his mind-set: He got out of his car with a gun on his hip; he disregarded a police dispatcher's advice not to follow Mr. Martin. And then he chased the teenager as he headed home, setting off the fight that led to Mr. Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That child had every right to do what he was doing, walking home,'' Mr. Guy said. That child had every right to be afraid of a strange man following him, first in his car and then on foot. And did that child not have the right to defend himself from that strange man?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Guy also underscored, as the chief prosecutor had done the day before, inconsistencies in Mr. Zimmerman's statements to the police and in a television interview with Sean Hannity. He lied, Mr. Guy said, and exaggerated. How could Mr. Zimmerman's skull have hit concrete 25 times, as he said, and sustain so few injuries? How could Mr. Martin have grabbed the gun, Mr. Guy asked, and not left any DNA on it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Why did he have to lie if he had done nothing wrong?'' Mr. Guy asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he mocked Mr. Zimmerman for telling Mr. Hannity that the events had been part of ''God's plan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the gun, he asked how Mr. Zimmerman could have grabbed it while being straddled by Mr. Martin unless Mr. Martin was getting up and trying to get away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, the prosecution's case appeared to rely more on emotion than on evidence. Often, prosecutors raised more questions than answers. By trial's end, it remained unclear how the confrontation actually began, legal experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the doubt that Mr. O'Mara tried to capitalize on during his closing argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They are supposed to use words like 'certainty' and 'definite,' 'without question,' 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' '' Mr. O'Mara said in a professorial tone. He continued, ''What aren't good words for prosecutors are 'maybe', 'what if', 'I hope so,' 'you figure it out.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Mara urged the jury not to ''fill in gaps'' or ''connect the dots'' for the prosecution, despite their emotions, because Mr. Zimmerman's freedom was at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is a tragedy, truly, but you can't allow sympathy to feed into it,'' Mr. O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To find Mr. Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder, jurors must agree that he shot Mr. Martin out of ill will, hatred, spite or an evil intent, a ''depraved mind.'' That charge carries up to a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manslaughter is a lower bar, one that could prove more appealing to a jury and more worrisome to the defense. Prosecutors must show only that Mr. Zimmerman killed without lawful justification. If a weapon is used, it could draw a maximum of 30 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense believed that it benefited from many prosecution witnesses. Mr. O'Mara repeatedly reminded the jury of the ''reasonable doubt'' defense lawyers raised during the trial and the assumptions prosecutors made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is ''not a shred of evidence,'' he said, that Mr. Zimmerman was not returning to his car after a police dispatcher suggested he not follow Mr. Martin, Mr. O'Mara said. The police dispatcher who was on the phone that night with Mr. Zimmerman when he used profanities testified that nothing the defendant said made him think he was full of hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbor with the closest view of the struggle said the man with red or light clothing was on the bottom (Mr. Zimmerman wore red). And a prominent forensic pathologist who is an expert on gunshot wounds said Mr. Martin was leaning over Mr. Zimmerman when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mere act of following someone, Mr. O'Mara said, ''is not an unlawful activity.&quot;As for the discrepancies in his client's statements: ''If you lie, it's normally with the intent to deceive,'' Mr. O'Mara said. ''If George Zimmerman had the intent to deceive, why would he give six statements?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mr. Zimmerman sat, listening with a blank expression, Mr. O'Mara made one final request to the jury as it prepared to deliberate his client's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Let him go back,'' he said of Mr. Zimmerman, ''and get back to his life.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, the beast has been ravenous for the murder trial of George Zimmerman, the Florida neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager. The case was swollen with confusing evidence, Florida's liberal self-defense laws and deep-seated racial tension. Cable coverage has been round the clock. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While hardly going the way of CNN's near total obsession, The Times gave the Zimmerman trial a great deal of daily attention, including frequently updated courtroom coverage on the Web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decisions about the amount of coverage to give a high-profile trial are always subjective. But it is notable -- and it opens The Times to criticism -- that this one got the kind of day-in, day-out attention that The Times did not deem worthwhile in a pair of other important cases this year: the trial of the abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell and the court-martial of Pfc. Bradley Manning, who leaked vast amounts of classified government documents. (Although the Gosnell trial did seem to get short shrift at first, I felt it was given adequate coverage by the end. But I have thought all along that the Manning matter deserves more sustained evidence of The Times's interest.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman trial coverage was solid. But foremost, The Times has showed its trademark strength with in-depth, enterprising pieces exploring the broader issues of this shooting and its aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, for example, Lizette Alvarez wrote skillfully about the racial issues that had emerged, noting that ''race lingers awkwardly on the sidelines, scarcely mentioned but impossible to ignore.'' That article appeared on the front page, the first during the trial to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first weeks after Mr. Martin was killed, on Feb. 26, 2012, The Times lagged behind, seeming not to recognize the broader implications and the way the teenager's death had captured public interest. But on April 2 it published an exhaustive and well-written account by four reporters that started on the front page and filled two full pages inside. It explored the polarizing effect of the shooting. Soon after that, a front-page piece by Serge Kovaleski investigated the police missteps after the shooting. (Some critics of The Times believe its motto should not be ''All the News That's Fit to Print'' but rather ''More, Later.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the enormous overload of coverage elsewhere, The Times tried to provide something distinctive. Charles Strum, the deputy national editor handling the story, told me that his aim had been ''to bring more light than heat, because, over all, this is a situation with more heat than light.'' While editing articles in the New York office -- most of them written by Ms. Alvarez, the Miami bureau chief -- he spent his days wearing headphones so that he could listen to live streaming of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There are a lot of accusations, a lot of misinformation and a lot of conspiracy theorizing,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smallest points were scrutinized. Why, for example, did The Times use so many descriptions of Mr. Zimmerman's ethnicity? Michael G. Brautigam of Brooklyn is one of many readers who commented on how The Times described Mr. Zimmerman. He wrote to me: ''If memory serves, George Zimmerman has been described in a significantly different way each day of the week.'' A week ago Monday he was labeled ''half Hispanic,'' the next day as ''half Peruvian,'' a day later as ''self-described Hispanic.'' Earlier, he was described as a ''white Hispanic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Ms. Alvarez to explain. ''It's been a struggle all along,'' she said. ''If he were black or if his name was Rodriguez instead of Zimmerman, this would have been a completely different situation.'' The case would not have had its racial flash point, she said. In a nation where a blend of race and ethnicity are more and more the norm, the labeling struggle is an effort to note that Mr. Zimmerman shares in that mixture more than his name alone indicates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately from news coverage, some readers complained about several Op-Ed columns by Charles Blow, finding them one-sided, with a particular complaint about one that appeared on July 3, comparing Mr. Zimmerman's videotaped re-enactment with his written and spoken statements. Richard Murphy of Fairfield, Conn., wrote: ''I realize that Mr. Blow is an opinion columnist, but does The Times really want to put Mr. Zimmerman on trial in its pages? Mr. Blow isn't reporting, he is deliberately attempting to discredit Zimmerman, to convince people of his guilt.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sent this complaint to Mr. Blow and asked him to respond. ''I simply raised questions about inconsistencies in George Zimmerman's accounts of his struggle with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking back over the columns that Mr. Blow has written on the case since last year, I found them generally thoughtful, if clearly sympathetic to the Martin family. The column that Mr. Murphy cited may have come close to the limits of fair comment, taking on a prosecutorial tone. If you believed the medical examiner, the columnist wrote, ''the struggle simply couldn't have happened as Zimmerman described it.'' Those kinds of judgments might have been best left to the jury. But columnists are allowed wide leeway, and even in this instance I found Mr. Blow within his rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times was slow off the mark on this story, and on some early developments, it let the local media break the news. But over all, it has done its job, satisfying interest without sensationalizing, covering the trial with a measured tone, and providing depth and perspective -- valuable commodities on a story all too capable of creating hysteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Strum, however, knows there are ways in which any coverage, no matter how thoughtful, must be found wanting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This trial brings up all the old pain of every violent racial crime that's ever happened -- with questions of who's the aggressor, whether a fair trial is possible, whether there is such a thing as equal justice in America,'' he told me. ''The questions are out there, and unfortunately, they won't be answered.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some were angry, shouting &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others just cried &quot;No!&quot; - with entire families breaking into tears and holding each other. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Some 100 protesters gathered in disbelief outside the Seminole County courthouse last night, as many worried that the verdict gives George Zimmerman and other vigilante neighborhood watchmen a &shy;license to kill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I at least thought he was going to get something - something!&quot; Rosie Barron, 50, told The Post tearfully outside the courthouse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He should've gotten something. He was told to stand down,&quot; said Ed Barnett, 57, of Liberty City. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;What can we do?&quot; he asked.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Thoroughly confused. Zimmerman doesn't last a year before the hood catches up to him,&quot; he tweeted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other Twitter celebs channeled their outrage into commentary and condolences. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Zimmerman is no angel but the lack of evidence and the concept of self-defense, especially in Florida law, gave the jury little other choice,&quot; he wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Peacable mini-protests popped up throughout the city. In Harlem, Ian Jackson joined a dozen other neighbors in holding &quot;Honk for Trayvon&quot; signs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;You hope that America will grow,&quot; said Jackson, 31. &quot;You hope that America will learn. You hope that America will realize the dream&quot; of equality. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his final, now unsuccessful argument to the jury deciding the fate of Trayvon Martin's killer, the prosecutor expressed what he thought was a simple &shy;assessment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This case is not about race,&quot; said John Guy. &quot;It is about right and wrong. It's just that simple.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not that simple. It never is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This case became a racial incident the moment George Zimmerman left his car with his gun and stalked an &shy;unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it's not that this kind of thing happens to blacks and people of color all the time that makes this about race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What makes this about race is that it never happens to anyone else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who else in The Bronx gets shot at 41 times by cops for reaching for a wallet, like Amadou Diallo did in 1998? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who else gets gunned down behind the wheel of his car in Queens on his wedding day like Sean Bell did in 2006? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And who else gets racially profiled every day when they are stopped and frisked all over New York City? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White immigrants don't come to America to get killed by cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  White grooms don't get gunned down by detectives on their way home from their bachelor parties. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And white teens don't buy Skittles and walk toward home and end up dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, George Zimmerman is as free as you or me. Actually, a jury said he's &quot;not guilty.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jurors last night acquitted George Zimmerman of all charges, exonerating the neighborhood-watch volunteer who killed an unarmed black teen, touching off national debates on racial profiling and the use of force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The jury of six women delivered the stunning verdict after 16 hours of deliberations - including 12 hours yesterday - declaring him not guilty of second- &shy;degree murder and manslaughter, in connection with the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman sat stone-faced when the verdict was read, blinking once before nonchalantly shaking hands with his lawyers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seminole County Court Judge Debra Nelson admonished courtroom onlookers to keep reactions to themselves - and they did, as no one uttered a peep when the words &quot;not guilty&quot; were read. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was only when Nelson left the bench that Zimmerman &shy;appeared to relax and enjoy his good fortune, breaking into a lopsided grin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We're ecstatic with the results, that George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything but protecting himself in self-defense,&quot; defense lawyer Mark O'Mara said. &quot;We're glad the jury saw it that way.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defense lawyer Don West said he was still angry that Zimmerman was even brought to trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police investigating the case had originally opted against &shy;arresting and charging Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think the prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful,&quot; West said. &quot;As happy as I am for George Zimmerman, I'm thrilled that the jury kept this tragedy from becoming a &shy;travesty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case became a lightning rod of racial politics as the nation debated whether Zimmerman's claim - that he feared for his life - justified killing Martin, who was walking home from a store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Martin was watching the NBA All-Star game with his father and his dad's girlfriend on that rainy night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hoodie-wearing teen bought Arizona Iced Tea and Skittles before leaving the &shy;7-Eleven and crossing Zimmerman's path. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman called cops, who told him to stay in his car. But he kept following Martin, leading to the deadly confron&shy;tation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Witnesses said they spotted Martin on top of Zimmerman, at one point, likely handing the &shy;defense all it needed to prove reasonable doubt.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Downcast lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda was clearly still upset, and rehashed basic facts of the trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Who was following who? Isn't that what this case boils down to?&quot; he said. &quot;What this case boiled down to was a kid, minding his own business, being followed by a stranger. A kid wearing a hoodie who was minding his own business being followed by a guy who wants to be a cop.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Attorney Angela Corey thanked jurors and said her prosecutors put forward their best possible case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We believe we brought out the truth on behalf of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Corey said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman was originally charged with second-degree murder before Judge Nelson's controversial decision to allow jurors to also consider the lesser charge of manslaughter, which still could have landed him in prison for up to 30 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About 100 people last night gathered outside the courthouse. Many of them broke down in tears when the verdict was read. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Members of Martin's family, a constant presence in the court throughout the trial, curiously did not attend last night's verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their lawyers would only explain that Martin's parents were in a &quot;safe location for security purposes&quot; last night - but said they would attend church services this morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The teen's father, Tracy Martin, reacted via Twitter: &quot;Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The teen's mom, Sybrina Fulton, tweeted: &quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trayvon's big brother, Jahvaris Fulton, wrote: &quot;Et tu America?&quot; - a play off Shakespeare's timeless Latin line &quot;Et tu, Brute?&quot; synonymous with betrayal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even though Zimmerman is a free man, he'll be watching his back, supporters said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We'll always be concerned about our safety and George's safety because of vigilantes,&quot; brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. told CNN. &quot;He has reason to think now more than ever that people could try to kill him.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prosecutors tried to paint George Zimmerman as a violent cop wannabe who racially profiled Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Zimmerman successfully leaned on Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows deadly force to save one's own life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The defense portrayed Martin as a pot-smoking troublemaker who liked to fight and had been suspended from school for skipping classes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   O'Mara said he's not sure what Zimmerman will do now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think you need to go somewhere, relax, get your bearings back,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;I'm sure if he could wave his magic wand, he'd get his life back.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors have begun their deliberations in the racially charged trial of a US neighbourhood watch volunteer accused of murderingunarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors retired after defence and prosecution lawyers made closing arguments in a final bid to sway the six-woman panel, which must reach a unanimous verdict to convict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hours later, the jurors returned to the courtroom to ask the judge and lawyers for a list of the evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was to resume deliberations yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Judge Debra Nelson reminded jurors that the onus was on prosecutors to prove their case against 29-year-old George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not necessary for George Zimmerman to disprove anything. Nor is George Zimmerman required to prove his innocence,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is up to the state to prove George Zimmerman&quot;s guilt by evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson also reminded jurors that Florida law allowed residents to use lethal force to defend themselves, under the state&quot;s &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The killing of a human being is justifiable and lawful if necessarily done while resisting an attempt to murder or commit a felony upon George Zimmerman, or to commit a felony in any dwelling house in which George Zimmerman was at the time of the attempted killing,&quot; Nelson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s lawyer closed his case by telling jurors that his client feared he was going to die when he shot Martin, 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He&quot;s not guilty of anything but protecting his own life,&quot; Mark O&quot;Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman faces possible life in prison if convicted of second degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were told they could also consider the lesser charge of manslaughter if they were not convinced he was guilty of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers rested their case without calling Zimmerman to the witness stand, after three weeks of evidence and testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial has been nationally broadcast on US television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting became a cause celebre last year after authorities initially did not bring charges against Zimmerman, prompting civil rights activists to charge that law enforcement would have pursued the case more zealously had the teenage victim been white.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was cleared of all charges Saturday in the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed black teenager whose killing unleashed furious debate across the U.S. over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, blinked and barely smiled when the verdict was announced. He could have been convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter. But the jury of six women, all but one of them white, reached a verdict of not guilty after deliberating well into the night. Their names have not been made public, and they declined to speak to the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s mother and father were not in the courtroom when the verdict was read; supporters of his family who had gathered outside yelled &quot;No! No!&quot; upon learning of the not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teen&quot;s father, Tracy, reacted on Twitter: &quot;Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother also said on Twitter that she appreciated the prayers from supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you. You are all that I have,&quot; she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night the 17-year-old was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys said the case was classic self-defense, claiming Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man&quot;s head against the concrete sidewalk when Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We&quot;re ecstatic with the results,&quot; defense attorney Mark O&quot;Mara after the verdict. &quot;George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of his defense team, Don West, said he was pleased the jury &quot;kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors called Zimmerman a liar and portrayed him was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; vigilante who had grown frustrated by break-ins in his neighborhood committed primarily by young black men. Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands, prosecutors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Attorney Angela Corey said after the verdict that she believed second-degree murder was the appropriate charge because Zimmerman&quot;s mindset &quot;fit the bill of second-degree murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We charged what we believed we could prove,&quot; Corey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the verdict drew near, police and city leaders in the Orlando suburb of Sanford and other parts of Florida said they were taking precautions against the possibility of mass protests or unrest in the event of an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said immediately after jurors began deliberating. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O&quot;Mara, Zimmerman&quot;s attorney, said his client is aware he has to be cautious and protective of his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There still is a fringe element that wants revenge,&quot; O&quot;Mara said. &quot;They won&quot;t listen to a verdict of not guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict came a year and a half after civil rights protesters angrily demanded Zimmerman be prosecuted. That anger appeared to return Saturday night outside the courthouse, at least for some who had been following the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosie Barron, 50, and Andrew Perkins, 55, both black residents of Sanford, stood in the parking lot of the courthouse and wept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I at least thought he was going to get something, something,&quot; Barron said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added her brother: &quot;How the hell did they find him not guilty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perkins was so upset he was shaking. &quot;He killed somebody and got away with murder,&quot; Perkins shouted, looking in the direction of the courthouse. &quot;He ain&quot;t getting no probation or nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several Zimmerman supporters also were outside the courthouse, including a brother and sister quietly rejoicing that Zimmerman was acquitted. Both thought the jury made the right decision in finding Zimmerman not guilty they felt that Zimmerman killed Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cindy Lenzen, 50, of Casslebury, and her brother, 52-year-old Chris Bay, stood watching the protesters chant slogans such as, &quot;the whole system&quot;s guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lenzen and Bay who are white called the entire case &quot;a tragedy,&quot; especially for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It&quot;s a tragedy that he&quot;s going to suffer for the rest of his life,&quot; Bay said. &quot;No one wins either way. This is going to be a recurring nightmare in his mind every night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, authorities in Martin&quot;s hometown of Miami said the streets were quiet, with no indication of problems. The neighborhood where Martin&quot;s father lives in Miami Gardens was equally quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman wasn&quot;t arrested for 44 days after the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting as police in Sanford insisted that Florida&quot;s Stand Your Ground law on self-defense prohibited them from bringing charges. Florida gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s parents, along with civil rights leaders such as the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, argued that Zimmerman whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic had racially profiled their son. And they accused investigators of dragging their feet because Martin was a black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before a special prosecutor assigned to the case ordered Zimmerman&quot;s arrest, thousands of protesters gathered in Sanford, Miami, New York and elsewhere, many wearing hoodies like the one Martin had on the night he died. They also carried Skittles and a can of iced tea, items Martin had in his pocket. President Barack Obama weighed in, saying that if he had a son, &quot;he&quot;d look like Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racially charged nature of the case, race was barely mentioned at the trial. Even after the verdict, prosecutors said the case was not about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case has never been about race or the right to bear arms,&quot; Corey said. &quot;We believe this case all along was about boundaries, and George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the few mentions of race came from witness Rachel Jeantel, the Miami teen who was talking to Martin by phone moments before he was shot. She testified that he described being followed by a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; as he walked through the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel gave some of the trial&quot;s most riveting testimony. She said she overheard Martin demand, &quot;What are you following me for?&quot; and then yell, &quot;Get off! Get off!&quot; before his cellphone went dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors had to sort out clashing testimony from 56 witnesses in all, including police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, witnesses who got fleeting glimpses of the fight in the darkness gave differing accounts of who was on top. And Martin&quot;s parents and Zimmerman&quot;s parents both claimed that the person heard screaming for help in the background of a neighbor&quot;s police call was their son. Numerous other relatives and friends weighed in, too, as the recording was played over and over in court. Zimmerman had cuts and scrapes on his face and the back of his head, but prosecutors suggested the injuries were not serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To secure a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury that Zimmerman acted with a &quot;depraved&quot; state of mind that is, with ill will, hatred or spite. Prosecutors said he demonstrated that when he muttered, &quot;F------ punks. These a-------. They always get away&quot; during a call to police as he watched Martin walk through his neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors had to convince the jury only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 2012, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. That is not in dispute. The question is whether it was second-degree murder or manslaughter, or if he acted in self-defense. After the killing, people angry with the shooting took to the streets to protest the lack of an arrest. After Zimmerman was arrested, throngs of both his supporters and opponents have been riveted by the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the jury is in its second day of deliberating the fate of George Zimmerman. As we wait for a verdict, here&quot;s a chronological gallery of photos looking back at the case, from gunshot to jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 14--NEW HAVEN &gt;&gt; Sensing his parishioners would want to talk about Saturday's &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict in the George Zimmerman case, the Rev. Frederick Streets encouraged them Sunday morning to stand up and share during mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure a lot of people didn't sleep last night,&quot; Streets said. &quot;There is still this perception of black men as threats. It is important to us to pause for a few moments and take an opportunity to share.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several parishioners at the Dixwell Avenue Congregational United Church of Christ, where the congregation is predominantly African American, did take that opportunity, taking the microphone to speak their minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury in Florida on Saturday cleared Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, of all charges in the fatal shooting of teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, claimed he acted in self-defense. Prosecutors portrayed Zimmerman as a vigilante who assumed Martin, who was young and black, was up to something, and confronted him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's Stand Your Ground law allows for the use of deadly force if someone believes they are in danger of death or great bodily harm. It allows an individual to stand his or her ground, with no duty to retreat from a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parishioner Jan Simmons said, &quot;Although the verdict is not unexpected, it still deeply saddens me -- justice is not something we experience as a people. There are policies that keep us oppressed, and the struggle continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant Police Chief Thaddeus Reddish called what took place in Florida &quot;a disgrace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every police officer is taught not to use deadly force unless it is absolutely necessary,&quot; Reddish said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Toni Harp, D-New Haven, a candidate for Mayor in New Haven, called gun violence &quot;a disease that has affected this entire country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can use the political system for change,&quot; Harp said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audrey Tyson said she is &quot;devastated,&quot; and wants to know why this happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe in God, but can't understand why this continues to happen to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, said people should talk about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young man's life can't just be lost -- write to newspapers, to Congress, mobilize,&quot; she said. &quot;He wore a hoodie and went to a store, and he was targeted and profiled by this vigilante. Vigilantism has to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let Florida know we are all watching -- it has to be all of us, not just one voice or two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parishioner Rodrick Muhammad said the black community needs to come together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know Trayvon is up in heaven, proud we didn't riot,&quot; he said. &quot;Pray harder, study the word of God harder. Let's rise up and become a family again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several parishioners shared stories of being racially profiled themselves, such as being pulled over -- and urged each other to speak up when it happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Streets told parishioners that he is sure there are many white people who are upset with the verdict also.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't feel you can't do anything -- move to change the Stand Your Ground law,&quot; Streets said. &quot;We have to pray and do the right thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. James Newman, who is president of the Greater New Haven Clergy Association and pastor of the New Freedom Missionary Baptist Church in New Haven, said many pastors may have had their sermons planned already, but in light of the verdict, he changed his to address the case Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did a sermon on justice and judgment and how people who do unjust things can always find a way out of feeling guilty,&quot; Newman said. &quot;They can always say that what they did was ok. God is the only judge and he wants us to do what is right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone I've talked to feels this was unjust,&quot; Newman said. &quot;Blacks still feel victimized by racism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newman noted there was a prison sentence in the case of an African American Florida woman who fired a warning shot in a domestic incident, without hitting anyone. He noted that Michael Vick also served time for his conviction in a dog-fighting case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet someone who kills a black kid gets no time,&quot; Newman said. &quot;Police told (Zimmerman) not to follow that kid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman had called police to report a suspicious person, and was told that officers were on their way and he shouldn't follow the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel very strongly this was unfair,&quot; Newman said. &quot;It is a sad day. Everyone who wears a hoodie on their head isn't a criminal. There is so much stereotyping.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Twitter and CNN kept up a steady buzz about the George Zimmerman jury deliberations all day, Edith Bush turned her back on it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't look at it. It's too emotional for me,&quot; said Bush, 81, of West Palm Beach. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like a nightmare that this is happening in this country, now with the 50th anniversary of the civil rights movement, and with the Supreme Court taking away our voting rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors began their second day of deliberations at 9 a.m. in Sanford, where they have been sequestered since Zimmerman's murder trial began more than three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush, a member of the Martin Luther King Jr. Coordinating Committee, is a veteran of the civil rights movement. More recently she was one of those who traveled to Sanford to protest the fact that it took police so long to arrest Zimmerman after the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush predicted trouble in the black community if Zimmerman is acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he gets off, it's going to be a powder keg,&quot; Bush said. &quot;The young people are tired of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So did Shawnette Solomon of West Palm Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are going to give him a slap, give him probation,&quot; Solomon said, predicting what might happen. &quot;If they do, he's not going to survive. ... To calm everything down, they are going to have to give him 10 to 15 years at least.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their opinions reflect the deep suspicion of law enforcement among area black residents. For many of them, this is not just a trial. They see it as evidence of a system that punishes black men unequally with white men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The white judicial system is on trial. The police are on trial. Racism is on trial,&quot; said Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Twitter, the racial gulf was in evidence. Tweets from court watchers were raucous. Some were reckless. One tweeter invited people to a fireworks show after Zimmerman's presumed acquittal. Others described comments as a &quot;black witch hunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some were just commenting on the knee-deep ironies of the debate. Many took the opportunity to use racial epithets and profanity, often directed at shrill legal commentator Nancy Grace. Mini-arguments broke out and were drowned out by hundreds of tweets continuing through the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone named Musu just wanted the long day to be over:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimmerman, let me go wash my damn hair.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd of hot, angry and bitterly divided demonstrators traded verbal jabs that at times degenerated into racial slurs outside the Seminole County Courthouse as jury deliberations in the George Zimmerman trial dragged Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff's deputies separated two men -- one black and one white -- before an impassioned argument could escalate in the football field-size &quot;free-speech zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Scott, a white man from Winter Springs, stood on the side of the lawn dedicated to supporters of George Zimmerman -- vastly outnumbered by black supporters of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and his family -- yelling &quot;Go get your welfare checks!&quot; and &quot;Go get some crack!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott's remarks enraged much of the crowd. An unidentified black man and Scott faced off before deputies intervened. They drew the men to different parts of the park and warned them that they would be forced to leave if deputies had to intervene again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You should take the opportunity to get to know black people instead of shooting them in the middle of the street in the middle of the night!&quot; the black man yelled as he was being led away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Goldsboro Welcome Center in the historically black neighborhood less than five miles from the courthouse, about a dozen people kept vigil in front of a television and hoped for a peaceful outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a time of release. It's a time of coming down. We've been waiting a year for this,&quot; said Francis Oliver, curator of the Goldsboro Historical Museum across the street who organized the &quot;verdict watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to concerns about blacks erupting in riots in the event Zimmerman is acquitted in Martin's death, Oliver said what she fears most is a guilty verdict. That could lead to more insidious retaliation than violence, such as employment problems or aggressive policing, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldsboro -- where there is a memorial for Martin near the community center -- was incorporated as a city in 1891. Twenty years later, against the will of its residents, it was swallowed whole by the city of Sanford, whose white leaders ousted their black counterparts without compensation, Oliver said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could undo everything we've done since 1911,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters and pastors from around the state gathered Saturday outside the courthouse, some promising nationwide protests if the neighborhood watch volunteer is not convicted of second-degree murder in last year's shooting death of Martin, 17, who was black and unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen organizers of last year's &quot;March to Sanford -- Justice for Trayvon,&quot; which drew more than 30,000 protesters, chanted and held signs as a few Zimmerman supporters, also carrying signs, stood quietly to the side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. L. Ronald Durham, pastor of the Greater Friendship Baptist Church in Daytona Beach, organized a rally last year in Sanford attended by Al Sharpton. Durham said he traveled from Daytona Beach to show his support for Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to let this jury speak. Once they have spoken, we will abide by whatever decision that is,&quot; said Durham, joined by two other members of the Daytona Beach Black Clergy Alliance. &quot;We hope that it will be one that is justifiable to the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. There needs to be accountability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford resident Adrienne Session arrived with her 17-year-old daughter at the courthouse before 10 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has you tense all the time,&quot; said Session, who is black. &quot;We just want things to be normal. We are all praying for peace. I just feel in my heart that it won't be.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debate swirled Sunday over the not-guilty verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, as public officials and private citizens focused on racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Nutter, who last year called the shooting &quot;an assassination,&quot; was among those who expressed disappointment in George Zimmerman's exoneration of any criminal wrongdoing. Zimmerman had faced second-degree murder or manslaughter charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A young black man is dead without any real explanation,&quot; Nutter said in a statement. &quot;George Zimmerman took an innocent life. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who at trial was made to appear threatening when all he had was a bag of Skittles and an ice tea, should not have died at Zimmerman's hands, and I believe the jury should have exacted a penalty.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From government offices and church pulpits, to public plazas and riverwalks, people - many with strong emotions - weighed in on the jury verdict that was issued late Saturday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the Municipal Services Building, the statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo, who had a poor relationship with Philadelphia's African-American community, was a focal point Sunday for a vigil for Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This system is still racist,&quot; read a poster that was hung around the statue's neck. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passers-by took pictures of the demonstration area and voiced their opinions on the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A young black kid was killed because he was black,&quot; said Aine Ni Shoinnaigh, 35, an Ireland native who immigrated to the United States five years ago. &quot;If Trayvon had been a young white kid in that suburb smoking a crack pipe, he probably would have been allowed to go home.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's mother is Hispanic, and his father is white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That man [Zimmerman] is going to have to live with that. He killed a child,&quot; said the Rev. Patricia Thomas, 61, associate pastor of Spirit and Truth Worship Cathedral in Strawberry Mansion. &quot;He got off legally, but morally he did not get away. We have a legal system that's broken.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It does seem like there's an underlying race issue,&quot; said Abby Blackmore, 28, a native of New Zealand who was visiting Philadelphia. &quot;It doesn't matter who killed who. [How people judge one another] should be color-blind.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Burton, 26, predicted a &quot;big race riot&quot; would occur as a result of the post-verdict passions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Philadelphia, as in many cities throughout the nation Sunday, protests over the verdict remained largely peaceful, despite highly charged emotions. In some places, demonstrators burned American flags as President Obama - and the Martin family - urged non-violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Parry, a former federal and state prosecutor who practices law in Philadelphia, reviewed the Zimmerman case and said &quot;Zimmerman should have never been charged in the first place.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thanks to Zimmerman's tenacious lawyers, the prosecution was forced to release the evidence that established self-defense,&quot; Parry said. &quot;It's not that they botched the case. They brought a case they should have never brought.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parry predicted the U.S. Justice Department would bring federal charges against Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said Sunday it is looking into the shooting death to determine whether federal prosecutors will file criminal civil rights charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the White House, Obama referred to Martin's death as a &quot;tragedy&quot; and called for &quot;calm reflection.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this,&quot; the president said. &quot;As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church in West Philadelphia, the sermon Sunday addressed the verdict indirectly, focusing on how God would want the congregation to react, and on the larger social ills that underlie the killing and its aftermath. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of consternation,&quot; said Pastor Tokunbo Adelekan. &quot;People are deeply disappointed. Profoundly upset. . . . But also not surprised at the way things have gone.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Racism is in the air that we breathe,&quot; Adelekan said after the service. He hoped his members came away with &quot;a sense of reassurance and hope,&quot; instead of &quot;a sense of retributive justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors' work was summed up in two words by Isaiah Elum, 21 and black, of Northeast Philadelphia, who was on a walk near the Art Museum Sunday: &quot;No justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe something should've happened,&quot; said Elum, whose thoughts then went to Martin's parents. &quot;At the end of the day, they lost a son. He's not here to tell his story.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests carried into the evening, when about 500 people gathered at LOVE Park before marching around City Hall and down Market Street toward Independence Mall shouting, &quot;Boycott Florida!&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't even like guns, but what it says is I better buy one,&quot; Michael Wilson, 55, of Philadelphia Action Network, said of the verdict. &quot;You better get a gun and be prepared to use it, because the police won't protect you.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Rousset, 27, a national organizer for Prometheus Radio Project, said the verdict &quot;continues a long legacy of white supremacy in the United States, and it continues to demonstrate the U.S. prison system is built on the bones of slavery to kill and incarcerate black and brown bodies, and never to protect them.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, Mary Parlee, 27, visiting from Boston, thought she knew how the verdict should go - until she watched the trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My initial thought was that George Zimmerman should have been locked behind bars for the rest of his life,&quot; Parlee said. She said she followed the case closely, and &quot;felt completely different after hearing the defense's arguments.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure he should have gotten off completely, but I can see why they came to that verdict,&quot; Parlee said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nutter's expression of disappointment over the verdict came with a call for constructive action: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to resolve to make life better in America for all our children, regardless of skin color. Let us focus our anger and resolve to work toward a more just, safer and more caring America.&quot; </SPAN></P>

Yet presidential mouthpiece Jay Carney labels those who've called out the administration &quot;willfully ignorant&quot; of how things operate in Washington.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Au contraire, Mr. Dissembler. Only Congress has the power to amend its laws, which scared the administration witless (ahem). Going back to Congress would have opened a door for ObamaCare's outright repeal. ... Judicial Watch says documents it obtained under the Freedom of Information Act suggest that the Justice Department helped organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin's accused killer, last year. Judicial Watch says Justice's Community Relations Service &quot;actively worked to foment unrest&quot; and even trained protesters. Talk about an injustice. Talk about race-baiting. ... Gun violence has become so bad in Chicago - home to 74 shootings during the Fourth of July weekend in which 12 died - one Democrat state representative has asked Gov. Patrick Quinn, also a Democrat, to call in the National Guard and Illinois State Police. Oh, we forgot to mention that Chicago has some of the toughest gun-control laws in America. ...

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shikha Dalmia at Reason.com: &quot;Even the Cold War border between the two Germanies, the most fortified manmade barrier, was breached about a thousand times a year. That, however, is not deterring House Republicans from demanding 'fully secure' borders as a condition for immigration reform. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The comprehensive immigration reform that the Senate passed recently would, thanks to Republican insistence, increase border security spending by a whopping $46.3 billion over the next 10 years. ... Coming on top of the $90 billion already spent on border security in the last decade, it mocks Republican calls for austerity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a world of limited means, spending more on harmless unauthorized workers means spending less on genuine criminals, hardly a recipe for making America safe. This is the same illogic that enviros deploy when they waste billions to scrub superfund sites to make the dirt edible by children instead of prioritizing cleanup dollars to fight genuine health threats.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT WAS NEVER ABOUT RACE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Lowry at Politico: &quot;The George Zimmerman trial is the racial metaphor that failed. Every day that passes makes it clear that none of the ideological baggage heaped on the case ever made any sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman is not a symbol of white America, or -- to borrow the stilted phrase The New York Times used to refer to him in its reports -- white-Hispanic America. The case is not about race relations. Incredibly enough, even the attorney for Trayvon Martin's family now says, 'We don't believe the focus was really race.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the extent that the trial has any larger meaning, it is a tale of the left's desperation to indict contemporary America as a land of rank racism, different in degree, perhaps, but not in kind from 1950s Mississippi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NO MORE WOMEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satirist Andy Borowitz: &quot;AUSTIN -- Republican lawmakers in the Texas State Senate are proposing a precedent-setting new bill that would make it illegal for women to live in the state. Sen. Harland Dorrinson, one of the many pro-life lawmakers backing the woman ban, crafted his bill after witnessing Sen. Wendy Davis filibuster an anti-abortion bill last month. 'That was our moment to say, &quot;Enough is enough,&quot; ' he said. 'This comes down to a choice between life and women, and we choose life.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sen. Dorrinson said his bill would call for a 20-foot woman-proof fence to be constructed along the borders of the state. 'Women are great at talking, but not at climbing,' he observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But another GOP state senator, Cal Jamson, believes that the total ban on women goes 'too far' and is proposing a less draconian bill that would allow some women to remain in the state as guest workers. 'Texas needs women to cook, clean, and cheerlead,' he said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POOR DON'T COUNT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthew Yglesias at Slate: &quot;Some people who advocate large-scale cuts in government programs that assist low-income families are not in fact motivated by callous disregard for the welfare of poor families. Some of them are driven by a principled dislike of government programs. The 216 House Republicans who voted for [last week's] agriculture bill, however, are not in that group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the wake of last month's legislative shenanigans. the GOP leadership decided to move a bill that exclusively funds farm subsidies with no food stamps component at all. And 216 Republicans voted for it. Because they don't have a problem with spending $195 billion over 10 years, they just want to make sure it goes to the right people. Not poor people, in other words. Farmers. Farmers who, on average, are richer than the typical American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SMART SEX?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Whitefield, blogging for the Los Angeles Times: &quot;That's it -- I am now officially out of step with modern life. What else can I say after reading this: 'Most adults always have smartphone close by, 1 in 10 use it during sex.' ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, everyone knows we live in a wired world. We're connected. We're 24/7 multi-tasking, multi-purpose, increased-productivity workaholics. But, with the wisdom of more than a few decades, and at the risk of being labeled a curmudgeon, I submit that there are some places a phone -- smart, dumb or otherwise -- simply doesn't belong: At a funeral; in church; at the theater; in a driver's hand/ear/lap in a moving car ... and certainly not in the sack.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla.c cCleared by a Florida jury, George Zimmerman walked free from criminal charges in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin but was still under fire from civil rights leaders and critics who were dismayed by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six women jurors who deliberated for 16 hours over two days found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter Saturday night in a case that has polarized the U.S. public. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debates about racial profiling, guns, self-defense laws and the equality of justice that arose from the 2012 shooting continued the morning after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remain stunned at the decision,&quot; civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said on CNN on Sunday. &quot;The Department of Justice must intervene to take this to another level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Sunday he had spoken to senior Justice officials about pursuing federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you look at comments made by young black men who lived in that neighborhood about how they felt especially targeted by (Zimmerman), there is reason to be concerned that race was a factor in why he targeted young Trayvon,&quot; Jealous told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors were sequestered during the three weeks of testimony and remained anonymous by court order. They declined to speak to reporters after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers had argued that Martin, 17, attacked Zimmerman on the night of Feb. 26, 2012, in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Prosecutors had to prove that Zimmerman committed a crime in pursuing Martin and that he did not act in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court unshackled Zimmerman from an electronic monitoring device that he had been wearing while on bail. Zimmerman, who had received death threats, now faces a possible civil wrongful death lawsuit from Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tense drama that had been building for 16 months climaxed with the late-night reading of the verdict when a court clerk said &quot;not guilty.&quot; Zimmerman, 29, showed no emotion at first, but later broke into a smile after sitting down. NO ARREST SPARKED OUTRAGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage over the case was triggered by the refusal of the police department in the central Florida town to arrest Zimmerman after the shooting, believing his story that he acted in self-defense when he shot Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests began in Sanford and soon spread around the country, creating pressure that forced the Sanford police chief to step down and led Florida's governor to appoint a special prosecutor, who brought a second-degree murder charge 45 days after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, spotted Martin from his car inside the gated community where he was a neighborhood watch coordinator and called police, believing Martin to be suspicious. The teenager was staying in the neighborhood, the houseguest of his father's fiancee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, after Zimmerman got out of his car, the two engaged in a fight that left Zimmerman with a bloody nose and head injuries. The encounter ended when Zimmerman shot Martin once through the heart with a 9mm pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics said special prosecutor Angela Corey overcharged the case by alleging second-degree murder, saying the lesser charge of manslaughter was more appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal will weaken any wrongful death civil lawsuit that Martin's family might bring. Such a case would have a lower burden of proof and Zimmerman, who opted against taking the witness stand in his criminal trial, might be forced to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will seek and get immunity in a civil hearing,&quot; said Zimmerman's lead defense lawyer, Mark O'Mara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader Al Sharpton called the verdict &quot;a slap in the face to the American people&quot; and urged federal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the example of Rodney King, the man whose videotaped beating by Los Angeles police triggered rioting two decades ago after a state criminal trial found the police officers not guilty. Later, the Justice Department prosecuted some of the officers in a federal civil case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators outside the Seminole County Courthouse where the trial was held chanted &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; before and after the verdict, and the activist group Act Now to Stop War and End Racism called demonstrations on Sunday in New York, Boston, San Francisco and other cities.c</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla.c cPresident Barack Obama called for calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, saying his death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleared by a Florida jury late on Saturday, Zimmerman walked free from criminal charges in the shooting death of Martin, but still faces public outrage, a possible civil suit and demands for a federal investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six women jurors who deliberated for 16 hours over two days found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in a case that has polarized the U.S. public. Zimmerman said he acted in self-defense while civil rights activists said the shooting was racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,&quot; Obama, the first black U.S. president, said in a statement. &quot;I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama, who last year said that &quot;if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,&quot; added that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president urged Americans to broaden &quot;the circle of understanding and compassion&quot; in their communities and put some of the emotion the case has aroused into curtailing gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,&quot; he said. &quot;We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the way to honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics contend Zimmerman wrongly suspected 17-year-old Martin of being a criminal because he was black, making it civil rights issue, while gun rights supporters saw Zimmerman as a persecuted hero who was exercising his right to bear arms assured by the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyers argued he acted in self-defense the night of February 26, 2012, when he and Martin met inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford. They accuse civil rights advocates of wrongly injecting the issue of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'SUCH A SHAME'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was such a shame. The whole case nearly destroyed George from Day One. ... That they put a racism spin on this prosecution just hurt him very deeply,&quot; said John Donnelly, a close friend of Zimmerman who testified in the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, Valarie Houston, pastor of the Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, dedicated a Sunday morning prayer service to Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am hurt. I am sad. I am disappointed and my heart is overwhelmed with pains,&quot; Houston said. &quot;I thought in my heart that justice would be served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leaders including Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Benjamin Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), urged the Justice Department to pursue federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jealous said Martin's family may bring a civil suit against Zimmerman but said federal criminal charges must be filed because evidence suggests race was a factor in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told CNN the black community is upset with a situation in which &quot;our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys. The robbers and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteer who think that they're keeping folks safer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, who called the verdict &quot;a slap in the face to the American people,&quot; cited the example of Rodney King, the man whose videotaped beating by Los Angeles police triggered rioting two decades ago after a state criminal trial found the police officers not guilty. Later, the Justice Department brought a federal case that resulted in the conviction of two officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department has not commented on the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, spotted Martin from his car and called police, believing Martin to be suspicious. The teenager, who was staying in the neighborhood at the home of his father's fiancee, was walking back from a convenience store where he bought candy and a soft drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, after Zimmerman got out of his car, the two engaged in a fight that left Zimmerman with a bloody nose and head injuries. The encounter ended when Zimmerman shot Martin once through the heart with a 9mm pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors had to prove that Zimmerman committed a crime in pursuing and killing Martin and that he did not act in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tense drama that had been building for 16 months climaxed with a court clerk's late-night reading of the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. Zimmerman showed no emotion at first, but later broke into a smile after sitting down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors were sequestered during the three weeks of testimony and remained anonymous by court order. They declined to speak with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court unshackled Zimmerman from a monitoring device he had been wearing while on bail. He previously only left home in a disguise and body armor, his lawyer said. His brother said he would remain out of public view for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal will weaken any wrongful death civil lawsuit that Martin's family might bring, and Zimmerman's lead defense lawyer, Mark O'Mara, predicted Zimmerman would win immunity from a civil suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators continued outside the Seminole County Courthouse where the trial was held chanted &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; before and after the verdict. Protests broke out in some U.S. cities including Oakland and Washington. The activist group Act Now to Stop War and End Racism called demonstrations on Sunday in New York, Boston, San Francisco and other cities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of a neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot an unarmed African-American teenager reverberated throughout churches and city streets Sunday as protesters demanded justice, while others were left to question just how much progress the nation has made when it comes to race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In San Jose, about 50 critics of the verdict gathered outside City Hall on Sunday evening, while in Oakland hundreds of demonstrators again marched through the downtown and blocked streets even as property owners continued cleaning up storefronts damaged in a chaotic overnight protest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aware of simmering tensions, President Barack Obama on Sunday asked the nation to accept a Florida jury's decision to acquit George Zimmerman, who is of European and Peruvian descent, in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know this case has elicited strong passions,&quot; the president said. &quot;And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said Sunday it would review Zimmerman's case for possible federal civil rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's slaying in the central Florida town of Sanford early last year set off a national debate about racial profiling and race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys for Zimmerman, upset about break-ins in his neighborhood, said he shot Martin in self-defense during a struggle. Civil rights leaders, who fought for weeks to get criminal charges filed against Zimmerman, questioned why he deemed the unarmed teenager, dressed in a hooded sweatshirt, to be suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland civil rights attorney John Burris criticized prosecutors and said their evidence didn't support a murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The travesty in this whole case is that a young man minding his own business was deemed suspicious and wound up dead,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late Saturday verdict sparked protests in several California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, but Oakland's was the only one marred by violence and vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters beat one man in a Broadway doorway near Frank H. Ogawa Plaza until other protesters ended the skirmish. The man was helped to his feet and did not appear seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other protesters took out their frustration on buildings. Sears, the Oakland Tribune, several banks and at least two restaurants all had windows broken. A BART police car was vandalized, and several garbage bins were overturned and set ablaze. Police made no arrests during the protest, which drew about 100 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Sunday statement, Mayor Jean Quan said the episode was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and would not be tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters in San Jose talked about boycotting the state of Florida and hoped that Zimmerman would face civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a problem when somebody acts as a vigilante and kills a child,&quot; Alicia Carbajal, 64, said. &quot;This was not justice at all. Trayvon was murdered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin case touched a nerve in Oakland, the city where Oscar Grant was shot and killed by a BART officer four years ago and where the police department is under federal supervision in part over a failure to stop racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there's a rawness ... on both sides that makes it more profound here,&quot; said Olis Simmons, who runs the nonprofit Youth UpRising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a Sunday morning sermon, Pastor Zachary Carey of True Vine Ministries in West Oakland criticized the &quot;senseless&quot; vandalism, but gave a grim assessment of the verdict's underlying message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In America, it doesn't matter if you're just walking home,&quot; he said. &quot;To them, we're all criminals. If you're black, you're a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many in the pews at True Vine, the verdict confirmed two unpleasant but deeply held beliefs: that the election of an African-American president doesn't necessarily mean the nation fully values their lives, and that the most vulnerable people in a society rife with fear of young African-American men are those young men, who must deal with people clutching their bags or questioning them as they approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see some of the other races, how they look at you with that suspicious eye,&quot; said 37-year-old Lamar Brantley, of Oakland. &quot;A person that's fearful is liable to do anything. It does make me fearful at times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronda Johnson said the verdict is a reminder that her sons face many threats, be it from gangs or the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We raised our boys to be hypervigilant,&quot; she said. &quot;They know that if a police officer talks to them, they need to watch their tone of voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carey urged parishioners to turn outrage over the verdict into positive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be marching on every state capital in America,&quot; he thundered. &quot;We should march on Washington and tell them that this is no longer acceptable in America, and we're not going to take it anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simmons said she is still struggling with what to say Monday to the teenagers in her program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have to tell them the same thing I told them during the Oscar Grant stuff,&quot; she said. &quot;That violence isn't justice. And that civic engagement leads to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- As downtown property owners cleaned up storefronts damaged in a chaotic overnight protest, organizers are planning afternoon demonstrations in Oakland and San Francisco to condemn the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests are planned at 3 p.m. in East Oakland at 73rd Avenue and International Boulevard and 4 p.m. at 14th Street and Broadway in Oakland and Powell and Market streets in San Francisco. They are part of protests nationwide, with rallies also planned Sunday in Florida, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Fresno and Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are all Trayvon,&quot; said Reiko Redmonde, who is organizing the Bay Area protests. &quot;This is not just a question for black youth but for all peoples' humanity, a questions of what kind of society and what of world we want to live in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations come after a march that began Saturday, hours after a jury acquitted Zimmerman in a Florida courtroom. At 12:30 a.m. Sunday, protesters knocked trash cans into the street and sometimes set the contents alight, creating small fires amid cheers from onlookers. One man was being beaten by a multiple attackers in a Broadway doorway near Frank Ogawa Plaza until other protesters surrounded the skirmish and yelled at the combatants to stop. The man was helped to his feet and did not appear to be seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 12:45 a.m., demonstrators remained in the area around 19th and Telegraph but numbers had significantly diminished. Some shouted that police were trying to &quot;kettle&quot; them, or corral them into a limited area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday morning, property owners were boarding up storefronts and cleaning graffiti, but broken glass remained on sidewalks along Telegraph Avenue and Broadway, the two thoroughfares that bore the brunt of the vandalism. Among the businesses damaged were Sears, the Oakland Tribune, and Flora, a restaurant on the 1900 block of Telegraph Avenue that was nevertheless busy during the lunch hour Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said, &quot;a small group of people gathered in downtown Oakland last night. Sadly, some of them dishonored the memory of Trayvon by engaging in violent activities that hurt our growing economy and endangered people. This is unacceptable as well. We will not tolerate violence in our city. We must come together to heal and move forward. In the days and weeks ahead our community will continue working to learn from this tragedy and to prevent this from ever happening again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAYWARD -- A woman was arrested Saturday after allegedly jumping on stage at a music festival and attacking a legendary musician after he dedicated a song to Trayvon Martin, according to police and eyewitnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, who police identified as 43-year-old Dinalynn Andrews Potter of Barstow, apparently yelled, &quot;it's all your fault&quot; before shoving 73-year-old Lester Chambers, his family said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She had a crazed look in her eye,&quot; said Kurt Kangas, a friend of Chambers who ran to his aid. &quot;I saw the devil there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers was performing at the Hayward Russell City Blues Festival downtown when around 5:15 p.m. he dedicated Curtis Mayfield's hit &quot;People Get Ready&quot; to Martin, the 17-year-old shot and killed by George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman on all charges Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers told the audience if Mayfield were around today, he'd change the lyrics &quot;there's a train a comin'&quot; to &quot;there's a change a comin,'&quot; his wife Lola Chambers told this newspaper Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She must have been an acrobat. She did it in one leap. He didn't see her coming,&quot; Lola Chambers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyewitnesses and Hayward police said people on stage subdued Andrews Potter after she allegedly shoved Chambers. Though the police investigation into a motive continues, family members believe the attack was racially motivated and was a result of Chambers' mention of Martin. The family is pressing police to file hate crime charges. Andrews Potter is white, they said. Chambers is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayward police took Andrews Potter to the police station, where she was arrested on suspicion of battery. She was cited and released, and could face additional charges in the coming days, according to Hayward police Lt. Ruben Pola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers, a Petaluma resident, was taken to the hospital but has since been released, and is using a cane to walk. A photo his son posted on Facebook shows a large welt on his backside. His son said Chambers had a &quot;bruised rib muscle and nerve damage and he is sore all over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambers was a member of the 1960s soul group Chambers Brothers and has had a well-publicized fight with record executives over decades of royalty payments he said he has never received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chambers Brothers will be part of the inaugural class inducted into the R&amp;B Hall of Fame later this year, Lola Chambers said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who saw the hit 2011 movie &quot;The Help&quot; will never forget Octavia Spencer as the sassy maid Minny, who baked a &quot;special&quot; chocolate pie for a racist white woman. The performance earned the now-41-year-old Alabama native an Oscar as best supporting actress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even though she seemed to come out of nowhere, the Auburn University graduate actually had been working as an actress since her early 20s, when she made her debut in the John Grisham thriller &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot; Spencer has since appeared in films such as &quot;Bad Santa&quot; and &quot;Big Momma's House,&quot; and in TV shows ranging from &quot;CSI&quot; to &quot;The Big Bang Theory.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; which won the top prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, Spencer plays the mother of a young man who is murdered by an Oakland, Calif., transit policeman during a New Year's Eve confrontation. The film is based on a killing that took place in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newsday spoke with the actress by phone from San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. What was it that interested you about this film?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. It resonated with me on a personal level, but I almost didn't take the part. I was sent the script, and some of the footage from the cellphone videos (of the incident), and I took the shortcut of watching the footage. I was angry, hurt, and at the time the Trayvon Martin incident had just occurred, and I thought anger was not the right emotion for this subject matter, and I passed. And my agent said, &quot;Read the script. Anger is not the way Ryan (Coogler, the film's writer-director) approached the subject.&quot; He presented a balanced look at (the main character), and that is what I wanted to be a part of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. You're also listed as a co-executive producer on the film. How did that happen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. We had a very limited budget, under $1 million, and while filming we lost a great deal of money, and I didn't want Ryan's vision compromised. I knew a lot of people with deep pockets and made calls, and I kicked in some of my own money. It's what I've always wanted to do, it was just a natural progression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. I read somewhere that during the course of your career, you've played a nurse something like 16 times. How come so many?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. There are only a few ways women of color are viewed: the nurturer, the caregiver, the wise sage. And I fit the nurturer-caregiver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. When did you realize you could make a living as an actor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. Once I realized I was going to pursue a career in this industry, there was nothing that made me think I couldn't make a living at it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q. What kinds of offers did you get after winning the Oscar?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. There's not a plethora of roles for women of color, and I'm basically a character actress. A lot were things I've played before - like moms - and some things I haven't played before, but were not fleshed out. If it's too much like something I've recently played, I turned it down. I don't care about the size of the role, it's the impact the role has in the script.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE next American presidential election is 1,213 days away, but the prospect of Hillary Clinton standing as a candidate is gathering momentum and threatening to clear the field of Democratic rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will not declare her intentions for at least another year, but two of the masterminds of the grassroots campaign that twice won Barack Obama the presidency have joined forces with activists to lay the groundwork for a Clinton bid in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Bird and Mitch Stewart helped Obama to defeat Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries. Last year Bird was Obama's national field director and Stewart was the director of battleground states. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have thrown their company, 270 Strategies, behind the Ready for Hillary political action committee, the clearest indication yet that the Democratic establishment is coalescing around Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stewart said their decision had only been taken after consulting the inner circle of Joe Biden, the vice-president, who has considered a 2016 run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a ton of respect and admiration for the vicepresident and reached out to his office prior to us making this announcement and there are no problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a further signal, Celinda Lake, the pollster in 2008 for Biden, has made a donation to the Ready for Hillary group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether Biden would run against the former first lady, Lake said: &quot;No. I just don't think he would choose to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He would appreciate the momentum behind her candidacy and I think they've always had enormous respect for each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another boost for Clinton, Silda Wall Spitzer, the wife of Eliot Spitzer, the disgraced former New York governor, has also donated money and is expected to play a key role in fundraising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview at the Ready for Hillary headquarters in a shopping centre just outside the Beltway highway that encircles Washington, Adam Parkhomenko, its executive director, said: &quot;This shows that we have a big tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about who can do the best job of getting a structure in place for when Hillary makes a decision about whether to run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton had promised to take a breather after she stepped down as secretary of state in February. But she has been active on the lucrative speaking circuit, commanding fees of more than $200,000 (&pound;130,000) a time, and she is also working on a memoir due out next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week a library in Little Rock, Arkansas, was named after her. Bill Clinton had been governor of the state for 12 years. Wearing one of her trademark bright purple trouser suits, she read The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle to a group of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lake said she thought the historic opportunity to elect the first female president would be central to Clinton's appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's interesting this time is the message of the historic nature of this candidacy is coming from the grass roots rather than the top down. Obama had that in young people and people of colour. Now I think women are carrying that message,&quot; Lake said. &quot;Women who most want a woman president are babyboomer women. They are a core of support for Hillary and many of them, myself included, think: if not her, who? And if not now, when?&quot; Republicans have already hinted that they will try to portray Clinton, who will be 69 in 2016, as too old and a throwback to the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't tell me Democrats are the party of the future when their presidential ticket for 2016 is shaping up to look like a rerun of The Golden Girls,&quot; said Senator Mitch McConnell, 71, earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lake said this line of attack would fail: &quot;It's a dead dog loser. For one thing the American electorate is ageing, too. But more to the point, I think people will be looking for more seasoned leadership in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will have an appreciation for her experience. And no one has ever questioned the capacity or the energy of any Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Ready for Hillary headquarters, Avery Jaffe, 20, said he was backing Clinton because she would symbolise a new era. &quot;Electing a black man was a sign of racism being in the past. Electing a woman would show we are a more equitable society,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear over Trayvon trial The jury in America's most explosive, racially charged case in decades returned to a Florida courtroom for a second day yesterday to consider whether a neighbourhood watch volunteer is guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and community leaders appealed for calm, fearing violent protests if George Zimmerman, 29, who says he shot Martin in self-defence, is acquitted or found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, 17, was walking to a house he was staying at in a gated estate in Sanford, Florida, when he was shot in the heart in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has prompted comparisons to the 1992 trial of four Los Angeles policemen accused of beating Rodney King, a black building worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 people died in riots triggered by their acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman case came as no surprise to several local criminal defense lawyers who were asked to predict the outcome of the trial while the jury was still deliberating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their unanimous prognostication was that the neighborhood watch volunteer charged in the shooting death last year of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin would be acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict options for the six women on the jury were not guilty, guilty of second-degree murder, or guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is going to be not guilty,&quot; Worcester defense lawyer Nicholas C. Bazoukas said hours before the jurors returned their not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the defense did a great job of presenting its case. The prosecution did not do as good a job. I just hope that whatever the verdict is, that people accept it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and civic leaders in Florida were hoping the same thing and pleaded for a peaceful reaction regardless of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to acquit this guy,&quot; said lawyer Peter L. Ettenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that the evidence that's been presented has been either inconsistent for the prosecution or has not been able to overcome the self-defense defense presented by Mr. Zimmerman. The prosecution's own witnesses have been contradictory to their theory and, in many instances, have helped the defense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ettenberg said he did not believe that race was or should be an issue in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that this was an individual who thought he was doing the right thing for his community and came across a kid who may or may not have been out for trouble. But this was clearly a confrontation that went beyond something you would normally expect,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it will be an outright acquittal,&quot; said Walter A. Rojcewicz, another local criminal defense lawyer asked to predict the outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Mr. Ettenberg, Mr. Rojcewicz said he believed much of the police testimony in the trial did little to harm Mr. Zimmerman and that some of it was actually helpful to his case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just think that there's reasonable doubt and that they're going to let Zimmerman go,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyer Michael M. Monopoli agreed, but qualified his response somewhat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would guess that it's going to be a not guilty,&quot; he said, but quickly added that it is always difficult to predict what a jury will do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While &quot;leaning toward it being a not guilty,&quot; Mr. Monopoli said he was unwilling to completely rule out the possibility of the jurors returning a &quot;compromise verdict&quot; and convicting Mr. Zimmerman of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITH POLICE and civic leaders urging calm, a jury has started deliberating George Zimmerman's fate after hearing duelling portraits of the neighbourhood watch captain: a cop wannabe who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning volunteer who shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the jury got the murder case, police in this Orlando suburb went on national television to plead for peace in Sanford, Florida, and across America, no matter what the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were big protests in Sanford and other cities across America last year when authorities waited 44 days before arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen protesters, most of them from outside central Florida, gathered outside the courthouse as the jury deliberated. Martin supporters outnumbered those for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During closing arguments, Zimmerman's lawyers put a concrete slab and two life-size cardboard cutouts in front of the jury box in one last attempt to convince the panel Zimmerman shot the unarmed black 17-year-old in self- defence while his head was being slammed against the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O'Mara used the slab to make the point that it could serve as a weapon. He showed the cutouts of Zimmerman and Martin to demonstrate that the teenager was considerably taller. And he displayed a computer-animated depiction of the fight based on Zimmerman's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said prosecutors hadn't met their burden of proving Zimmerman's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, he said, the case was built on &quot;could've beens&quot; and &quot;maybes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn't been proven, it's just not there,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;You can't fill in the gaps. You can't connect the dots. You're not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rebuttal, prosecutor John Guy accused Zimmerman of telling &quot;so many lies&quot;. He said Martin's last emotion was fear as Zimmerman followed him through the gated townhouse community on the rainy night of February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that every child's worst nightmare, to be followed on the way home in the dark by a stranger?&quot; Guy said. &quot;Isn't that every child's worst fear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women - all but one of them white - will have to sort through a lot of conflicting testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors deliberated for three-and-a- half hours before stopping on Friday evening. They will resume deliberations on Saturday morning. Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter. Under Florida's laws involving gun crimes, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second- degree murder: life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge's decision to allow the jury to consider manslaughter was a potentially heavy blow to the defence: It could give jurors who aren't convinced the shooting amounted to murder a way to hold Zimmerman responsible for the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara dismissed the prosecution's contention that Zimmerman was a &quot;crazy guy&quot; patrolling his townhouse complex and &quot;looking for people to harass&quot; when he saw Martin. O'Mara also disputed prosecutors' claim that Zimmerman snapped when he saw Martin because there had been a rash of break-ins in the area, mostly by young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer said Zimmerman at no point showed ill will, hatred or spite during his confrontation with Martin - which is what prosecutors must prove for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, prosecutors argued Zimmerman showed ill will when he whispered profanities to a police dispatcher over his cellphone while following Martin through the neighbourhood. They said Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; the teenager as a criminal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMERICA is gripped by the George Zimmerman trial. The fate of the Hispanic vigilante who shot and killed unarmed black teen, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, has become the biggest race sensation since OJ Simpson was acquitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more twists and turns than an episode of Law &amp; Order, the seemingly open-and-shut case has got the airwaves buzzing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the way a TV network doctored the tape of a 911 call, to make Zimmerman sound racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the victim's girlfriend who was destroyed by the defence, unable even to read a letter she supposedly wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a &quot;knock knock&quot; joke used by Zimmerman's &quot; lawyer as the victim's mother sobbed in open court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drugs in Trayvon's system and witnesses who saw the teen on top of Zimmerman - the pendulum has swung back and forwards, making this more like entertainment than a murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time you read this the verdict will probably be out - and guilty or innocent, the debate will rage for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's disturbing to see how political the case has become - with Republicans largely - supporting the defence and outraged Democrats rallying to the prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most appalling aspect that has emerged is yet ANOTHER Obama abuse of power - one that would be unthinkable in Britain. It has emerged the Department of Justice PAID for protests over the Trayvon killing - funding activists to march, even - as charges were being considered against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine Home Secretary Theresa May trying that - a British judge would have dismissed the case in two seconds flat for prejudicing a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing is certain - Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was unarmed. And if America had gun control, a fist fight between the two men is the worst thing that would have happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, one young man is dead and the other is having his life turned upside down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no potential Presidential candidate shows any sign of being willing to slow down - america's own private arms race - and we can bet Trayvon won't be the last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abuse</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reactions from black community to George Zimmerman verdict was intense and personal. They feel there was not justice and the verdict sens a terrible message, particularly to young black males.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA - As the verdict came in late Saturday night that George Zimmerman was not guilty of killing 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the reaction in the black community was a mix of despair, anger and caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families with young male teenagers particularly felt pained by the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a somber moment, said Curtis Stokes, former Hillsborough County NAACP president, who has a 14-year-old son. If he is walking home from the YMCA, do I tell him to be on his guard because the system may not be in his favor? Do you tell him to start dressing another way? He can't walk with a hoodie on? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Darryl Rouson has five sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do I tell my sons about the value of life? he said. It's just a hard message. It's clear to (singer) Ray Charles, Trayvon (Martin) was profiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rouson said the legislature needs to clarify its stand your ground law. I'm upset, he said. It's your castle, it doesn't mean your neighbor down the street from where you live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Babb III, founder and executive director of 2nd C.H.A.N.C.E. Center 4 Boyz, a faith-based group in Tampa that brings together mentors with at-risk youth, says this is not the time for anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the time for introspection. It's a time for prayer, said Babb. Because two parents still don't have a son, and another man has to bear the burden for what he did for the rest of his life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the trial put the jurors in a very difficult situation, no matter what decision they made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's going to be a lot of anger on both sides, and it's based on ignorance. Because we don't know all the facts, Babb says. Only two people know the truth. One just went through a trial, and the other is dead. We can't change what happened, so let's move forward and try to take steps that this doesn't repeat again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Harris, a former University of Florida football player and Denver Bronco, also volunteers with the  youth through the Center for Boyz. Earlier this week, in anticipation of possible turmoil brought about by the decision, he posted on his Facebook page for people to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't let the actions of others plant a bitter seed in our own hearts, he wrote. In the end, God has the final say, not us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris says he won't be surprised if the acquittal leads to unrest and more racial division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately following the verdict Tampa and St. Petersburg police reported no incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a sad day for race relations, said Tampa Heights resident Walter Niles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niles said while all the talking heads on television said it was not about race, it seems to be very much about race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefully, the community will be reflective, Niles said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time to pay attention to the idea of inclusiveness, Niles said. We have to be inclusive of all people regardless of what they look like. We cannot say that all black men are up to criminal activity because they are wearing a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents should not just be concerned for their teenage children,  Niles said, but any young black man that 's out in public that can be racially profiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the verdict is in, he said,  it is an opportunity for dialogue, for parents to talk to the young people and for training for crime watch communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Trayvon's parents, Niles said, this is like him being murdered all over again. We have to grieve with them, support them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dianne Hart was coming into her East Tampa beauty shop to prepare for an upcoming meeting when she heard the verdict on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I honestly feel sick, she said. It's crazy. I don't think justice was done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tampa City Councilman Frank Reddick said the verdict was an outrage. We think we made progress with the first African-American president ... but this has set us back, he said. The message sent to young African-American black males that already have a trust issue with police enforcement is now we've got another issue. We've got to change this. It is going to be my focus from this day on.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's acquittal late Saturday sparked mixed, emotional reaction across Tampa Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonika Witchard, 25, waited for the verdict at a St. Petersburg bar on First Avenue S, scrolling through Twitter on her Samsung Galaxy phone. When two words - NOT GUILTY - appeared on TV screens above, she thought of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family. She thought of her own. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to cry for them,&quot; the St. Petersburg College student said. &quot;It is terrible. It doesn't make sense. It's like, 'What if it happened to me?' What if we had to go through that pain?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Sullivan, 38, who works for a St. Petersburg financial company, said the jury's decision reinforces gun rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a concealed weapons permit holder,&quot; he said, &quot;I can walk around freely with my weapon and I don't feel I have to second-guess myself if I'm in a position where I have to defend myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sophie Smith, a Seminole teacher, watched the verdict on TV at St. Petersburg's World of Beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe Zimmerman had the intent to kill. I'm glad he's not guilty,&quot; said Smith, 38. &quot;I believe he was an innocent man. It was a bad situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downtown, 30-year-old Eunitee Franklin feared the possibility of riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something's going to happen,&quot; the Clearwater musician said. &quot;How can you possibly say not guilty? How can you play it off like this man did not kill a kid? I think it's sad. So sad for Trayvon's family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a liquor store in lower-income Tampa Heights, a small group of patrons unanimously reacted with shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackie Poe went running into the parking lot to call relatives in Delaware and commiserate over what they agreed was a travesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should've ended when the cops told him to stay in his car,&quot; said Poe, 54. &quot;How the hell they can let a man get away with murder, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cynthia Wenzelburger, 49, agreed the verdict was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wenzelburger, a paralegal, was not impressed by the job Zimmerman's defense attorneys did and was surprised it held sway with the jury. Wenzelburger said she thought the trial was won in jury selection, when six woman were selected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're more prone to leniency, when it comes to sending someone to prison,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;After a 5-week trial, 50 witnesses and 16 hours of deliberation, 6 jurors decide:<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women late Saturday found that George Zimmerman shot to death 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to save his own life on a rainy night in February 2012 when the two met in a gated suburban neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After deliberating more than 15 hours, jurors found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman showed little emotion as the verdict was read about 10 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the evening, jurors sent a note to the judge asking for clarification about the charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May we please have clarification on the instructions regarding manslaughter,&quot; Judge Debra Nelson read from the jurors' note Saturday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the state and Zimmerman's defense decided to respond by asking the jury to be more specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court cannot engage in general discussions but may be able to address a specific question regarding clarification of the instructions regarding manslaughter,&quot; they wrote back to the jury. &quot;If you have a specific question, please submit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors, who have been sequestered during the trial, did not immediately respond but continued deliberating as the sun fell and night descended on protesters gathered in front of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center. The group was the largest and most vocal since the trial started three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, but prosecutors also persuaded the judge to allow them to offer the jury a lesser charge of manslaughter, punishable by up to 30 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors had to show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors would had to have convinced jurors that Zimmerman acted with ill will, hatred or spite toward Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second-degree murder is punishable by life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, the two groups of protesters were peaceful for most of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man against violence in the media played a banjo. Two women walked on stilts and started a chorus of Lean on Me.One woman pretended to be dead in the grass, near a bag of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, a smaller group of Zimmerman supporters held signs that said, &quot;We love you George'' and &quot;George got hit you must acquit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman wore a T-shirt that said &quot;I believe you Zimmerman'' and held a sign that said &quot;It doesn't matter what this sign says you'll call it racism anyway.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He deserves some respect and appreciation,&quot; Casey David Kole Sr., 66, shouted about the former neighborhood watch leader. &quot;It's a tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patricia Dalton, 60, yelled back: &quot;It's a tragedy that could have been avoided!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalton, like most of the 100 or so people at the suburban Orlando courthouse, said she came to support the family of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some had come just to watch, standing in the shade outside the protest area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the afternoon, a man began shouting about welfare checks and crack cocaine and got into a heated exchange with a Martin supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police separated the two, but no arrests were made. Later, after dark, two men were ejected from the protest zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family say Zimmerman profiled Martin because of the teen's race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those allegations, and a 44-day delay before police arrested Zimmerman, sparked nationwide protests involving leading national civil rights leaders and spurred emotional debates about gun control, self-defense laws, race, and equal justice under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and civic leaders have pleaded for calm in Sanford and across the country after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York on Saturday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that no matter the verdict, any demonstrations that follow it must be peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Jesse Jackson had a similar message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tweeted that people should &quot;avoid violence because it only leads to more tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday morning, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, shared on Twitter what she called her favorite Bible verse:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women were crying and the college students were chanting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few minutes had passed since the not guilty verdict had made its way down to the front lawn of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center. The crowd was buzzing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many had been here since early Saturday, on a day that seemed to alternate between harmonious, tense, absurd and back again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, in the glare of the television lights and the realization of the verdict, curses and wails filled the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in the middle of all this was a 38-year-old Tampa man with his arms crossed and his expression blank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not mad. I'm not upset. I've been expecting this for months and months,'' said Life Malcolm. &quot;There's a long history, a long pattern, of white people killing black men and then coming to some court of law and being found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always our fault. We shouldn't have reached for our wallet. We shouldn't have gotten out of the car. We shouldn't have been where we didn't belong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe this was justice. They had a trial, and a jury made a decision. (Defense attorney) Mark O'Mara even said this should help us believe in the system. But why doesn't the system ever work for the black man? It may work for you, but it's killing us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like it or not, this was justice. And the system was fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury listened to two weeks' worth of testimony and determined there was not enough hard evidence to conclude George Zimmerman wasn't acting in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't mean anyone with Malcolm's point of view is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For even if you believe the verdict itself had nothing to do with race, this whole tragic episode began because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had the misfortune of being a black teenager in the wrong neighborhood on the wrong night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That reality seems inescapable. Zimmerman called 911 and eventually crossed paths with Martin not because the teenager had done anything wrong, but because he vaguely matched the profile of suspects in recent neighborhood burglaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the same profile - a young black man - that had led Zimmerman to call 911 multiple other times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the truth about the actual confrontation remains in doubt, the moments leading up to it are all too clear. It was Zimmerman who incorrectly decided Martin was suspicious. It was Zimmerman who did not listen to a police dispatcher. It was Zimmerman who got out of his vehicle. And it was Zimmerman carrying a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was racism from the beginning, and it continued through the trial,'' said Walt Byars, 27, of Tampa. &quot;They tried to make Trayvon look like a thug. They tried to make it sound like he was the one who was out looking for trouble. He was a teenager out for a walk, and now he's dead and a murderer is free.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few of us, it seems, have come to this case with an open mind. We believed in Zimmerman's guilt or innocence, and we tended to hear only the evidence that supported our intractable positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that reason, we need to have faith in the six women on the jury. We need to believe they viewed the facts dispassionately and considered the judge's instructions carefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean you have to agree with them. And that doesn't mean we don't still have miles to go with race relations in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For if we learned anything from this trial and the debates it spawned, it is that many of us still have a difficult time seeing the world through the eyes of our neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This whole thing began with a teenager lying dead on a rainy night, and an armed man insisting that a fatal shot was his only choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It finally ended late Saturday, nearly 17 months later, with a crowd outside the courthouse protesting a jury's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's the lessons learned in between that, hopefully, we won't forget.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women late Saturday found that George Zimmerman shot to death 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to save his own life on a rainy night in February 2012 when the two met in a gated suburban neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After deliberating 16 hours and 20 minutes over two days, jurors found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, showed little emotion as the verdict was read about 10 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 17 months, the case has held the attention of a nation still divided by racial differences, exposing old tensions and sparking debate about gun control and Florida's expanded self defense laws. Sanford police were slow to arrest Zimmerman, prompting flashes of protest in cities across the country. A garment - a sweatshirt with a hood - became a political statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorneys said their client would never have been arrested had the races been reversed. Martin was black. Zimmerman was Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If George Zimmerman was black, he would have never been charged with a crime,&quot; Mark O'Mara said. &quot;This became a focus for a civil rights event. They decided George Zimmerman was going to be a person they could blame ... none of which was supported by the facts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara said Zimmerman was ecstatic with the verdict and that the meaning won't set in for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He can actually realize that he doesn't have to come back to the courthouse tomorrow or ever again.&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful,&quot; said Zimmerman lawyer Don West. &quot;I'm thrilled that this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State prosecutors said their biggest challenge was taking over a case late and outside their jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a challenge when the governor gave this case to us,&quot; said State Attorney Angela Corey, a special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Rick Scott. &quot;We did the best we could.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also difficult was trying to prove Zimmerman was guilty of murder or manslaughter under Florida's expanded self-defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justifiable use of deadly force is one of the most difficult areas of the law,&quot; Corey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the evening, jurors had sent a note to the judge asking for clarification about the charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May we please have clarification on the instructions regarding manslaughter,&quot; Judge Debra Nelson read from the jurors' note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the state and Zimmerman's defense decided to respond by asking the jury to be more specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court cannot engage in general discussions but may be able to address a specific question regarding clarification of the instructions regarding manslaughter,&quot; they wrote back to the jury. &quot;If you have a specific question, please submit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors, who were sequestered during the trial, did not immediately respond but continued deliberating as the sun fell and night descended on protesters gathered in front of the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said they accomplished the goal of bringing the case to a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt that everyone had a right to know everything about this case,&quot; Corey said. &quot;We believe we brought out the truth on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda, who tried the case for the state, said he was disappointed, but respected the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West, who faced personal attacks during the trial for a bad joke during opening arguments and squabbling with Judge Nelson, said, &quot;There's no winners here. There are also no monsters here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's parents, Tracy and Sabrina, thanked them, saying they &quot;made Sanford and many other cities safer for our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole word was looking at this case for a reason,&quot; Crump said. &quot;We wanted to see how far we have come in America in terms of racial justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Martin's parents, who weren't in the courtroom to hear the verdict, were heartbroken, but they thanked their supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To everybody that attended a rally,&quot; Crump said. &quot;To the millions of people that signed petitions. To the prosecution. ... To everybody that put their hoodies up, and to everybody that said, 'I am Trayvon,' his family expresses their heartfelt gratitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and civic leaders have pleaded for calm in Sanford and across the country after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York on Saturday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that no matter the verdict, any demonstrations that follow it must be peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday morning, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, shared on Twitter what she called her favorite Bible verse: &quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, as news of the verdict spread, some screamed. Others chanted: &quot;No justice! No peace!&quot; The glare of hot lights from the surrounding television cameras lit the field a group of protesters had occupied all day, those supporting Martin far outnumbering the handful of those calling for Zimmerman's freedom. Before long, it was all but abandoned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After five weeks of trial and 56 witnesses, few legal observers believed prosecutors came close to proving Sanford, Fla., neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman committed second-degree murder when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, for many legal analysts, it was no surprise that jurors rejected even a lesser &quot;compromise&quot; verdict of manslaughter, acquitting Zimmerman outright of all criminal charges and deciding he acted in a reasonable way to protect his own life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal was a stinging blow for prosecutors and their decision to file the second-degree murder charge against Zimmerman, who was not initially arrested by Sanford police after claiming self-defence. And it was a resounding embrace of the defence's strategy during closing arguments not just to establish that prosecutors hadn't proven Zimmerman guilty, but also to show he was &quot;absolutely&quot; innocent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury clearly believed that you have a right to defend yourself,&quot; said Jude M. Faccidomo, the former president of Miami's Florida Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Especially when cases are so grey, like this one was, self-defence really resonates because people can associate with being afraid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while some also have questioned the state attorney's office acceptance of a mostly white jury, a more diverse panel would have returned the same verdict, lawyers who have watched the case believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After seeing the quality of the evidence presented by the state, the diversity of the jury really didn't matter in the end,&quot; said Larry Handfield, a prominent African American Miami criminal defence lawyer. &quot;But it would have helped the community in giving more credibility to the decision to acquit Zimmerman.&quot; By now, the basic outline of the confrontation between the 29-year-old volunteer watch co-ordinator and the 17-year-old Miami Gardens, Fla., student have become familiar through wall-to-wall television coverage and thousands of news stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; Martin, who was returning from a nearby convenience store and was walking through the gated Retreat at Twin Lakes neighbourhood where he was staying with his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called a non-emergency police number to report Martin as &quot;suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A violent struggle followed on rain-slicked grass and a concrete walkway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the confrontation, Zimmerman shot and killed Martin at point-blank range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look at the evidence shows why the jury rejected the state's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For prosecutors intent on proving the more serious charge, proving the &quot;illwill,&quot; &quot;hatred&quot; or &quot;spite&quot; needed to convict on second-degree murder hinged on painting Zimmerman as a frustrated, would-be cop fed up with intruders in his gated Sanford community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do so, they focused on Zimmerman's past - over defence objections - introducing evidence of his interest in law enforcement, including a ride-along with Sanford police, a class on criminal justice, an unsuccessful application to a Virginia police department. Prosecutors also played five calls to police that Zimmerman made in the several months before the shooting, in an attempt to show a pattern of &quot;profiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also introduced evidence about his membership at a mixed martial arts gym. Their most important evidence to prove &quot;ill-will&quot; was Zimmerman's call to a Sanford police non-emergency dispatcher when he first spotted Martin, saying &quot;these assholes always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there was ever a window into that man's soul, it was that defendant's words on that phone call,&quot; prosecutor John Guy told the jury Friday in a poignant closing argument that appeared to have at least one juror emotionally strained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy's closing argument was typical of a state's case that drew heavily on emotion and emphasized the youth of the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's prosecution was made tougher under Florida's 2005 Stand Your Ground law, which eliminated a citizen's &quot;duty to retreat&quot; before using lethal force in the face of a deadly threat - an instruction given to jurors on Friday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After much anticipation following flight delays, one 10-minute transfer between planes and a helicopter ride that finally brought the Ska Fest headliner to Victoria from Morocco with only a few hours to spare, Yasiin Bey, a.k.a. Mos Def, took the stage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Peace sign for Trayvon,&quot; he said in tribute to slain American teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, whose shooter was found not guilty Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't die, we live forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some commentary on justice wasn't unexpected from Mos Def. Last week, the hip-hop artist was the subject of headlines for voluntarily undergoing the force-feeding procedures common to Guantanamo Bay, where Muslim prisoners have announced a hunger strike for Ramadan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was also about music and Mos Def gave the small audience at Ship Point some love with cover tunes (Notorious B.I.G, Human Beings) and originals including Fake Bonanza, Auditorium, Life in Marvelous Times and the yet-to-bereleased Young Love Never Dies. Mos Def's performance marked the end of the 14th annual festival, which saw more than 30 artists and groups take stages around the city beginning July 9. Festival organizer Dane Roberts said there were a few other difficulties for some of those who came from afar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were a lot of challenges in terms of flight delays,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Roberts saw a silver lining in some lineup shifts, like when David Hillyard and Rocksteady 7 went in for J Boog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That made it so that a lot of the people who were roots and reggae fans were exposed to some good traditional ska jazz Cuban music,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It worked for Jesse Fraser, 21, who called Rocksteady 7a highlight even though he didn't know the group before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraser won passes for the festival on Facebook and attended events all week. He said what he liked about the crowds at the festival was their diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's nice to see people who wouldn't normally listen to this kind of music come out and enjoy it,&quot; Fraser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, like Amanda Hawkes and Elena Lockhart came for one specific show (Dub FX).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eli Konsorado saw Ska Fest from the stage, as a member of local reggae-ska-punk band Hillside Hooligans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were the very first group to play Skafest this year on opening night, it was a huge honour,&quot; he said. Konsorado said he's performed at the festival for the past five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Skafest is really like a big family event for the performers, who've been coming back year after year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end of his set, Mos Def announced he was going to do something decidedly Canadian and dropped his own rendition of Toronto artist Drake's YOLO. asmart@timescolonist.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida: A Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman on Saturday for the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, setting free a man who had become a polarizing figure in the national debate over racial profiling and self-defense laws.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel of six women deliberated more than 16 hours over two days until nearly 10 p.m. on Saturday (0200 GMT Sunday) before delivering the verdict, which drew immediate condemnation from some civil rights groups. <BR>Zimmerman appeared stoned-faced as the verdict was announced, but then showed a slight smile of relief.

It showed the justice system does not have their backs,&quot; said Jared Hamil, 25, a Tampa warehouse worker. <BR>Martin's parents were not in the court during the reading of the verdict. But his father, Tracy Martin, later tweeted that his son would have been proud of the fight put up for him. <BR>&quot;Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Together can make sure that this doesn't happen again.&quot; <BR>Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, said Martin, 17, attacked him on the night of February 26, 2012, in the central Florida town of Sanford. Prosecutors contend the neighborhood watch volunteer in his gated community was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who tracked down the teenager and shot him without justification. <BR>The jury could have convicted him of second-degree murder, which would have carried a sentence of up to life in prison, or manslaughter. The jurors, who remain anonymous, declined to speak to the press. <BR>&quot;Today, justice failed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and his family,&quot; Roslyn Brock, who chairs the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement. <BR>&quot;We call immediately for the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the civil rights violations committed against Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. This case has re-energized the movement to end racial profiling in the United States.&quot; <BR>Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson tweeted within minutes of the acquittal: &quot;Avoid violence, it will lead to more tragedies. Find a way for self construction not deconstruction in this time of despair.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case drew protests, scrutinyWhat happened in Sanford that February night may never have gone beyond the back pages of a local newspaper if police had immediately arrested Zimmerman.  <BR>But he walked free for more than six weeks after the shooting, because police believed his assertion of self-defense, triggering protests and cries of injustice across the country.  <BR>This forced the resignation of Sanford's police chief, and brought U.S. Justice Department scrutiny to this town of 54,000 residents not far from Disney World in Orlando.  <BR>It also drew comment from President Barack Obama, who said: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot;  <BR>Bernie de la Rionda, the assistant state attorney who was the chief prosecutor in the case against Zimmerman, said he and his two fellow prosecutors were disappointed with the outcome but accepted the verdict.  <BR>&quot;We live in a great country that has a great criminal justice system. It's not perfect, but it is the best in the world and we respect the jury's verdict,&quot; he said.  <BR>Benjamin Crump, a Florida lawyer representing Martin's family, said he hoped the public reaction to the verdict would be peaceful. But he did not conceal his sense of injustice over the trial's outcome.  <BR>&quot;The whole world was looking at this case for a reason, and what people wanted to see, as we all said, was how far we had come in America in matters of equal justice,&quot; said Crump. &quot;We have to have very responsible conversations about how we get better as a country and move forward from this tragedy and learn from it.&quot;  <BR>The Seminole County Sheriff's Office said it had heard nothing about any potential violent reaction to the verdict in and around Sanford, where about 30 percent of the residents are black.  <BR>Near a makeshift memorial to Martin in Sanford, only a few people showed up after the verdict.  <BR>&quot;It's very quiet so far,&quot; spokeswoman Kim Cannaday told Reuters after the jury's decision was handed down.  <BR>Reaction around the country also appeared peaceful in the hours after the verdict.  <BR>About 40 protesters gathered at Daley Plaza in downtown Chicago, said Officer Ron Gaines, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. Officers were watching the gathering, he said.  <BR>In San Francisco, news video footage showed a few hundred protesters marching through the middle of a street, with some holding signs and others raising their fists in the air. Police vehicles followed them on the sidelines of the march.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker made her case last week for getting cameras out of the courtroom in high-profile trials. &quot;The excessive coverage and commentary we've watched in recent years may be good theater but bad for justice. Most recently, we've been witness to the carnival trial of George Zimmerman, charged in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. We've seen the families; we've met neighbors and friends; and we've heard the screaming on the recorded 911 call.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parker argues that most trials that end up on TV are much more about entertainment than any loftier purpose like the public's right to know. She's right; most televised trials are there for market share and that usually is achieved by satisfying the public's prurient viewing pleasure. Let's face it, mundane trials make mundane TV. No one televises the contract dispute, the second-degree burglary trial, or the slip and fall, unless, perhaps, it involves Kim Kardashian slipping on sea-gull guano on Rodeo Drive. &quot;If our concern were truly to better understand the machinations of the judicial system ... we would record and broadcast all trial proceedings rather than only the ones that involve key elements of modern tabloid storytelling, namely sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll - and race. &quot;The Zimmerman trial is riveting not because two men got in a scuffle and one of them died or because one was a teenager and the other an armed adult. It is that one was black, the supposed victim of a profiling vigilante, and the other white... .&quot; Again, Parker's observations are valid. There is something important missing when almost the only trials the public sees are the equivalent of Lifetime Movies With Lawyers. A compelling case, can be made, for instance, for letting the public see some serious drama. How about the U.S. Supreme Court in action? I disagree with Parker, however, on whether the Zimmerman trial should have been televised. From the moment that the tragic shooting came to light, this case, rightly or wrongly, became a referendum on race relations - an issue that ought to matter to everyone. At some point those tuning in, watching recaps or reading about it, surely have felt compelled to do some mental role-playing, Maybe they've put themselves in either the place of Zimmerman, the volunteer neighborhood watch captain turned second-degree murder defendant, or Martin, the 17-year-old victim irate over being targeted. What would we do in a similar situation? Would we exercise better judgment? Would we have followed the police dispatcher's message to Zimmerman that he could stand down and wait for authorities to arrive? Was Zimmerman acting in self defense when he shot the unarmed Martin? Was Martin also acting in self defense when he fought back? On balance, airing the Zimmerman trial has done more social good than social harm. If nothing else, it's made us think. That could not be said for most other high-profile trials. The O.J. Simpson trial shed some light on domestic violence, which exacts a brutal toll respecting no social or racial boundaries. But the hows and whys of Nicole Brown Simpson's death became secondary, overshadowed by a circus: showboating attorneys, a judge enamored with the limelight, bumper-sticker arguments, &quot;If it (glove) doesn't fit, you must acquit,&quot; and Simpson went free. That case also involved questions of race. The trial and how it ended turned into a referendum on the jury system. At least briefly, the nation lost faith in an institution, which, with a few anomalies, is better than any other system devised. I do not know what the social take-away is from the Casey Anthony trial two years ago. Millions of armchair jurors tuned in and became heavily, if not obsessively, invested in the outcome of the troubling case involving the death of a 2-year-old. Anthony was acquitted of felony charges. As with O.J. before her, she became a public pariah, convicted in the court of public opinion, which proves that there are all kinds of justice. If anything, the trial became a referendum on how much the public should be influenced by legal commentators, many of whom smugly proclaimed, moments before the verdict, that Anthony would be found guilty on all counts. &quot;You could argue that never before in the history of criminal trials in America have so many who pretended to know so much for so long been so wrong so quickly,&quot; one chagrined analyst later admitted. Don't look for a referendum on any social issue coming out of the televised murder trial of Jodi Arias, convicted in her former boyfriend's death. Had Arias been a homely sociopath. Had her sexual escapades not been part of the story. Had she not engaged in overkill - stabbing her victim, slitting his throat and shooting him; had she not changed her testimony as often as she changed demeanor, would the TV networks have paid any attention? Instead they aired the entire five-month reality show. And re-trial of the penalty phase has not yet begun. Obviously, there should be some restraints, some common sense about what ends up on TV. Cameras do change the tenor of trials. Years ago, the &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine examined the issue, arguing that judges must retain some latitude in keeping cameras out if they are convinced that their presence &quot;may intimidate vulnerable witnesses, prejudice the jury or turn the public against a notorious or unpopular defendant.&quot; But on the other side of the argument, &quot;The Economist&quot; said, is the fact that the courts perform the people's business. &quot;The public's confidence in the justice system is a pillar of the rule of law. It is difficult to understand how citizens can be expected to have confidence in a system that most never see.&quot; Julie DelCour, 918-581-8379 a class=&quot;ArticleLink&quot; href=&quot;mailto:julie.delcour@tulsaworld.com&quot;julie.delcour@tulsaworld.com SUBHEAD: Trials, tribulations of cameras in the courtroom </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, FLA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - A Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman of charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter Saturday night in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a case that alternately fascinated and appalled large segments of a spellbound nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman bowed his head in the moments before the verdict was read. As the judge confirmed the verdict with jurors, one of the six women in the jury sat with a face flushed with emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the jury filed out of the courtroom, the defendant's brother, Robert Zimmerman, sitting in the second row, hugged his mother, Gladys Zimmerman. The row became a swirl of tears and hugs. A man sitting next to Zimmerman's brother slapped his hands together in joy and sobbed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury deliberated for more than 16 hours over two days until 9:47 p.m. Saturday, when court officials announced that there was a verdict.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prosecution of George Zimmerman was disgraceful,&quot; Zimmerman's attorney Don West said after the verdict. Mark O'Mara, another Zimmerman attorney, wondered aloud at a news conference &quot;how many civil lawsuits will be spawned by this fiasco.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, dozens of demonstrators, backlit by a sea of television camera lights, massed on the long lawn outside the Seminole County Circuit Courthouse. Some carried signs decrying &quot;racial oppression&quot; and demanding &quot;Justice for Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a somber post-verdict news conference, Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's family who led the early public relations push for Zimmerman's arrest, said the teenager would go down in the annals of history &quot;next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till.&quot; He was making a reference to African Americans killed in two of the most infamous slayings of the civil rights era. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Saturday, the jury had sent a note to Judge Debra Steinberg Nelson requesting clarification of instructions related to manslaughter, signaling that they were taking a hard look at the lesser of the two charges against the former neighborhood watch volunteer and sending a jolt through the courtroom and the crowd outside. Before starting deliberations, the jury was given a cautionary note by Nelson, who instructed them that &quot;Zimmerman cannot be guilty of manslaughter by committing a merely negligent act or if the killing was either justifiable or excusable homicide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The saga of Zimmerman's shooting of Martin, an unarmed African American teenager, filtered into the American vernacular, transforming &quot;hoodie&quot; sweatshirts into cultural markers and provoking a painful reexamination of race relations in this country. Even the racial and ethnic identity of Zimmerman - he has a white father and a Hispanic mother - demanded a reordering of conventional paradigms. He was frequently referred to as a &quot;white Hispanic,&quot; a term that, for some, reflected a newly blended America and, for others, felt like an uncomfortable middle ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys fought over Zimmerman's fate in a heavily guarded and windowless fifth-floor courtroom, calling more than 50 witnesses during three weeks of testimony before a sequestered six-woman jury. Afternoon thunderstorms sometimes shook the building, but the participants could see nary a drop of rain as they relived the night in February 2012 when Zimmerman killed Martin after spotting the 17-year-old walking through his gated community in the rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A parallel trial seemed to be taking place outside that cloistered space, with running debate on cable television and the Internet spurred by live-streaming coverage of the trial that effectively turned millions of Americans into quasi-jurors armed with every minute detail of the case. Others jammed into the small courtroom, lining up each morning for the coveted 24 seats allotted to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, watched with a neutral expression, sitting in his customary position at the defense table in ill-fitting blazers that an older friend bought on sale at Men's Wearhouse for him to wear at the trial. Once, he'd dreamed of becoming a policeman or a prosecutor, and at times, he seemed to be observing the proceedings with the detachment of a moderately engaged student. Only at breaks - when the jury had left the courtroom - did he sometimes let his blank stare crack a bit. He would circle the defense table giving congratulatory handshakes to his attorneys before being escorted by a bodyguard and court security officers to a waiting room down the hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind Zimmerman, on the opposite side of the courtroom, sat Martin's parents - Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton. The father, whom Martin was visiting in Sanford on the night of his death, watched stoically, his emotions measured best by the slowing or accelerating speed of his jaw muscles as he ground through packs of gum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents, whose presence throughout the trial lent a powerfully visceral note to the proceedings, were not in the courtroom when the verdict was read. Daryl Parks, a family attorney, said he advised them to stay home and attend church Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The images on the courtroom screen and those painted by the attorneys were sometimes too much to bear. Fulton, her hair pulled tightly into a bun on top of her head, stood and hurried out of the courtroom on Friday when O'Mara showed a photo of her 17-year-old son in death. She often turned away when close-ups of the bullet that pierced her son's heart flickered onto the screen. She wiped tears during closing arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's parents were banned from the court during testimony because they were witnesses, but they took seats just a few steps away from Fulton across the aisle during closing arguments. (Martin's parents were also witnesses, but they were allowed to watch each day because they were immediate family members of the deceased.) The two sets of parents had dueled inside the courtroom and outside it. The parents each testified that they heard their son crying for a help in the background of a key 911 call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 11, 2013 - the first anniversary of Zimmerman's arrest - Gladys Zimmerman issued an open letter, saying her son had been taken into custody &quot;solely to placate the masses.&quot; She was referring to large racially charged demonstrations, including a &quot;Million Hoodie March,&quot; that were organized to protest the initial decision of local authorities not to charge Zimmerman with a crime. Martin's mother responded with a statement calling the assertion of Zimmerman's mother &quot;disingenuous and disrespectful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the talk of race outside the courtroom, its role inside the trial was muted - more subtext than central theme. Nelson, the stern judge overseeing the case, ruled that prosecutors could say Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; Martin but could not say he &quot;racially profiled&quot; the teen. The decision disappointed some African American leaders who had hoped the action inside the courtroom might deepen the national conversation about race that was happening outside the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson, a former prosecutor who was appointed to the bench in 1999 by Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, sparred repeatedly with West, Zimmerman's attorney. In one of the trial's signal moments, Nelson stormed off the bench shortly before 10 p.m. while West was talking, abruptly ending a marathon evidence hearing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson ruled that jurors would not be allowed to see text messages found on Martin's cellphone about fighting and guns because they could not be authenticated. &quot;Why you always fighting?&quot; a message from one of Martin's friends said, according to a defense expert. West had been eager to introduce the texts to further the defense claim that Martin was the aggressor in the fight and that Zimmerman - whom a gym owner described as &quot;soft&quot; and unathletic - was overpowered by the tall and slender teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara and West, a former rock-and-roll DJ with a shaved head and an imposing courtroom presence, succeeded in turning many of the state's key witnesses into assets for the defense. They got John Good, a neighbor, to testify that he saw a figure in dark clothes (Martin's hoodie was dark) straddling another person and doing a mixed-martial-arts-style &quot;ground and pound&quot; while &quot;raining down blows.&quot; They also got lead police investigator Chris Serino to testify that he believed Zimmerman's self-defense account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local prosecutors had not pursued the case, but Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) appointed a special prosecutor, naming State Attorney Angela Corey of Jacksonville, Fla., to oversee it. Corey's assistants, who argued the case, often seemed to struggle with their own witnesses. Bernie de la Rionda, a veteran prosecutor with a booming voice and a penchant for making fun of his own baldness, tangled repeatedly with Serino. And he struggled with Shiping Bao, a medical examiner and key witness, who testified that Martin might have lived for up to 10 minutes after being shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing was important because Zimmerman had told police investigators that he spread Martin's arms after the shooting to check for weapons, but the teen was found with his arms under his body. Bao's assertion allowed the defense to suggest that Martin might have moved his hands in the moments before his death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their best moments, prosecutors were able to highlight inconsistencies in Zimmerman's accounts of the shooting and build a narrative about him as &quot;a wannabe cop&quot; who shot Martin &quot;because he wanted to, not because he needed to.&quot; They had much to work with - police conducted several taped interviews with Zimmerman and recorded a reenactment - all without Zimmerman requesting an attorney. Prosecutor John Guy said it would have been a &quot;physical impossibility&quot; for Zimmerman to have reached behind his back for his concealed and holstered Kel-Tec 9mm handgun if he had been lying on the ground with Martin on top of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vincent di Maio, a distinguished silver-haired forensic expert who entered the courtroom with a Panama hat in hand, spoke at length about the gunpowder tattoo that formed on Martin's skin as the bullet entered Martin's body. The appearance of the tattoo, di Maio testified, was unshakable proof of the defense claim that Martin was leaning over Zimmerman with his sweatshirt failing away from his chest when the shot was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the verdict was delivered, O'Mara might have summed it up best, saying two lives were changed forever on that rainy night in the Retreat at Twin Lakes. The question that lingered is whether America was changed, too.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wal-Mart has attracted controversy for decades: Its supporters laud its low prices and market efficiencies, while its opponents charge that the company exploits workers, destroys local economies and pollutes the environment. Now, despite warnings from the retailer that it would reconsider its plans to open three stores in Washington, the D.C. Council has passed a living-wage bill that would require Wal-Mart to pay its workers here at least $12.50 per hour. Let's examine a few of these impressions about the world's largest retailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Only lower-income people shop at Wal-Mart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wal-Mart sells lots of cheap stuff, so it's no surprise that low- and middle-income shoppers are the store's most regular customers. However, wealthier people are  among the more than 60 percent of Americans who shop at Wal-Mart each month. A 2005 Pew Research Center survey found that more than three-quarters of respondents from households earning more than $75,000 a year thought Wal-Mart was a good place to shop, and nearly 80 percent of them had shopped at Wal-Mart in the previous year. Of customers in this income group, 38 percent described themselves as regular Wal-Mart shoppers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Critics just want to unionize Wal-Mart workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the efforts to improve working conditions and compensation at Wal-Mart are led by union-funded groups that have been branded as allies of Big Labor seeking only to line their pockets with more union dues. But practically, none of these efforts has focused on formally unionizing Wal-Mart's unorganized domestic workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, as early as 2005, groups such as Walmart Watch and Wake Up Walmart waged a largely successful campaign focusing not on Wal-Mart workers' union status but on their compensation and benefits. A year after Walmart Watch was founded, the retail giant lowered premiums on its health insurance policies and allowed part-time workers to obtain medical coverage for their children. The newer group Our Walmart has coordinated recent worker strikes in a similar attempt to put pressure on the retailer in the court of public opinion, but still explicitly says that it does not intend to represent Wal-Mart workers in formal negotiations with their employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Wal-Mart is great for low-income Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Low-income shoppers need low prices because the manufacturing jobs with living wages that might have sustained them in earlier generations have been moved to sweatshops overseas, leaving poorly paid service jobs in their wake. Wal-Mart's low-income customers thus have more in common with foreign workers than they may realize: Both are caught in a global economy that has discounted their labor in the name of cheap consumption. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prioritizing consumption (what we pay for goods) over production (what workers earn for making goods) means that even low-income families whose economic futures have been jeopardized by the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs can see Wal-Mart as a savior, not a villain. Yet the retail giant's genius lies in camouflaging its exploitation in terms that frame its relentless cost-cutting as a kind of benevolence. For example, the company in 2006 declared itself &quot;a lifeline&quot; for millions of Americans facing harsh and uncertain economic times, adding that &quot;perhaps more than any single company in America, Walmart is providing the opportunity for a better life for poor and working families.&quot; Still, even if Wal-Mart's low prices help low-income Americans make ends meet at the cash register, the low wages offered by Wal-Mart (and other comparable retail service jobs) do little to help low-income families shoulder the burden of other rising costs, such as health care and housing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Wal-Mart is bad for the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Environmental Protection Agency has repeatedly sued Wal-Mart for faulty stormwater management and illegally dumping hazardous chemicals and pesticides at its retail sites, among other offenses. As recently as May, for instance, Wal-Mart agreed to pay nearly $82 million in fines for violating environmental regulations in California and Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the truth about the chain's environmental record is more complex, simply because Wal-Mart has unmatched power to promote change on the consumption end. The company is good at lowering prices, and it turns out that many forms of conservation are also good business. When something helps the bottom line - be it developing more fuel-efficient trucks or demanding that suppliers develop lighter, low-waste packaging - conservation measures are a no-brainer. Moreover, consumer blocs seeking environmentally friendly products can create changes that ripple throughout the food and grocery industry, given Wal-Mart's unparalleled market clout. When the retailer announced in 2008 that its store brand of milk would come from cows not treated with synthetic hormones, it credited consumer demand. The intense environmental scrutiny on Wal-Mart has also led the company to pursue additional sustainability measures. Wal-Mart's most recent Global Responsibility Report notes that its stores and distribution centers drew more than one-fifth of their electricity from renewable sources. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Washington's living-wage bill shows that communities can stand up to Wal-Mart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true that living-wage ordinances like the one the D.C. Council passed recently  can potentially boost wages for the employees of large retailers. But such legislation is frequently defeated or vetoed, or struck down in federal court. For example, in 2006, Chicago's city council passed a measure similar to D.C.'s that required big-box retailers to pay well above minimum wage, and to spend additional money on benefits. Less than two months after it passed, Mayor Richard Daley vetoed it, citing the promise of economic development that Wal-Mart could offer some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the Maryland Senate approved legislation in 2005 that required large employers to spend a set portion of their payroll on health benefits or contribute to state Medicaid coffers. (Although not mentioned by name, Wal-Mart was effectively the bill's  only target.) Then-Gov. Bob Ehrlich promptly vetoed the measure - and even after the state Senate overturned his veto, the legislation was found illegal in federal courts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Wal-Mart attempts to open stores in urban areas, challenging the world's largest retailer requires more than legislation. New York City, for instance, has successfully resisted company's attempts to enter Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn. Not only have city council members been opposed to the retailer's advances, they've been supported by relatively strong displays of union clout signaling that a long, protracted battle awaits. Local governments are probably more effective in keeping out Wal-Mart than they are in garnering concessions on wages and benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - At 2:30 p.m. Friday, six women rose from their seats in Courtroom 5D here and slipped into a back room where they will decide a case that has transfixed the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key piece of evidence will go to the same back room: the Kel-Tec 9 mm handgun that neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman used to kill teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors will consider charges of second-degree murder, which requires prosecutors to prove Zimmerman had a &quot;depraved mind&quot; and &quot;ill intent,&quot; and the lesser offense of manslaughter. But Judge Debra Nelson blocked a prosecution attempt to add the option of a third-degree murder charge based on the claim that Zimmerman committed child abuse since Martin was a minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Friday afternoon, the jurors asked the judge for an index of all the evidence, the Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their deliberations began not long after Zimmerman's defense attorney told jurors that much still isn't known about what happened on that dark, rainy night in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in a soothing, conversational tone, attorney Mark O'Mara urged jurors not to make assumptions about the defendant accused of killing Martin and not to try to &quot;fill in blanks&quot; or &quot;connect dots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only conclusion jurors could reach about his client after hearing testimony for three weeks, O'Mara said, is &quot;innocence. Pure, unadulterated innocence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes into his closing argument, O'Mara walked over to the defense table, and Zimmerman, dressed in a dark blazer and tie, stood. The defendant held his head high and gazed directly at the jury with a neutral expression on his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara placed his hand on the shoulder of Zimmerman, a humanizing gesture. O'Mara's demeanor contrasted with the style of assistant state attorney Bernie de la Rionda, who often shouted and spoke in impassioned tones during prosecution closing arguments on Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, a massive court case was settled in Florida. A jury of six women found neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of all charges in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandra Thompson, president of the York NAACP chapter, spoke from the organization's national convention in Orlando, Fla., about 30 minutes away from where the trial took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically, our reaction mirrors the reaction of many people of color, many people who want justice,&quot; she said. &quot;We have a history of differential treatment based on race and color. The people who say it's not a race issue are the people who are not civil rights advocates.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But change begins at the institutional level, Thompson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're trying to make changes in the system itself -- even Pennsylvania has a similar law. People of color are always on the wrong end of those type of laws,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the NAACP's convention is &quot;We shall not be moved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are requesting a national demonstration - but peacefully,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;We're not going to be moved. That is the spirit of what is now on the agenda for the NAACP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some reactions from other Yorkers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Chris DeMarco, 45, York Township, property manager: &quot;I think George Zimmerman is really lucky. Before the trial I thought for certain they would find him guilty. I think it's a sad day in this country that a teenager can be shot on the street. The verdict's in and people should respect it. I'm not in favor of the Stand Your Ground law. It creates too much ambiguity with what was formerly self-defense, and I think it opens up a Pandora's box of what happened here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Clarence Brown, 43, York City, musician: &quot;It's not a race issue. The fact that somebody got killed -- you have someone who killed him -- it's like, well, so you can kill somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Joann Spangler, 77, Spring Garden Township, retired: &quot;As far as the Zimmerman verdict thing is concerned, I think it was the right verdict. The system is supposedly the fairest way to do it. If I was being followed, I would go home. And then it became a black and white issue, which it shouldn't be because Zimmerman is Hispanic. I hated to see it become a race thing. If it was two white guys, no one would've cared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Woody Spangler, 77, Spring Garden Township, retired: &quot;Everybody has an opinion. I think it's terrible. Everybody jumped on it and said 'Oh boy, I can make something out of this.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Al Grove, 62, Hellam Township, respiratory therapist: &quot;I thought it was a fair verdict. It didn't seem like the prosecution had enough evidence. I didn't like all the racial tones; it shouldn't be about race at all. A lot of people try to take advantage of that. ... It divides the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- McKenzie Wolf, 42, Jacobus, chiropractor's office: &quot;I think we need to respect our justice system. These kids are growing up too fast, they're getting into situations they shouldn't be in. For those people who have (gun permits), it's a shame to try and take that away. It's sad, but it's a wakeup call.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Kendall Wolf, 15, Jacobus, student: &quot;I just think that that they almost made this into such a big deal because it was black versus white. It's all self-defense. You see the blood pouring down the back of his head. It's absurd. It's in Florida, where there's a law justifying that it was OK, and you're still trying (to convict him). There was so little evidence against him that when they tried to prove he was guilty, it was almost a lost cause. It's sad in general, but it's justified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Brian Roby, 21, Hopewell Township, student: &quot;I think (Stand Your Ground) is pretty ridiculous. It's so vague, and they never really give any guidelines to it or anything. I'm not really for it. In my opinion, even though I'm going into law enforcement, I don't ever see the time where taking someone's life is justified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Greg Wahlberg, 61, Dover Township, pastor at Calvary Baptist Church: &quot;Any time there's a death, there's a tragedy and my heart goes out to those families. I thought it'd become sensationalized. I'm sure that the verdict was based on evidence.&quot;<BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Americans are more politically divided than ever, the media may have a lot to do with that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Gallup Poll indicates that 55 percent of Americans get most of their news from television - where news is pretty much sliced and diced to suit particular points of view. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On CNN recently, for instance, anchor Suzanne Malveaux went to great lengths to rehabilitate the prosecution of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. When a friend of Zimmerman's testified that she recognized his screams on the infamous 911 call because she'd worked with him on a political campaign, Malveaux suggested the prosecution could claim that Zimmerman's enthusiastic cries at a political rally might be similar to ones uttered while &quot;pummeling Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; with &quot;a sense of joy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A guest had to remind Malveaux that the screaming voice on the 911 call wasn't one of jubilation, but of cries for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why was Malveaux so intent on propping up the prosecution of George Zimmerman? Her CNN colleague Piers Morgan appeared to share her zeal for Zimmerman's scalp. Why -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially when the evidence is unclear, at best, who was besting whom in that fateful fight - and when there is some pretty compelling evidence that Zimmerman was the one being pummeled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, whereas Zimmerman's facial and head injuries are well-documented, with ABC News long ago reporting Zimmerman sustained a broken nose, two black eyes and cuts to the back of the head, CBS News long ago reported that, &quot;Wounds found on (Martin's) knuckles may support George Zimmerman's claim that the unarmed teenager assaulted him before he was fatally shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most fair-minded observers have predicted an acquittal in the case, because of the conflicting evidence and, in fact, to evidence buttressing Zimmerman's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a legal matter, I just don't see how a jury convicts him of second-degree murder or even manslaughter in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; writes ABC legal analyst Dan Abrams. &quot;...(I)f they follow the letter of the law, it's hard to see, based on everything we know now, how they find him guilty of either murder or even manslaughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If an already restive core of Martin supporters gets all its news from CNN, they would be shocked by an acquittal - and perhaps angered into lashing out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the little-watched but incendiary MSNBC - which a former producer there wrote recently behaves at times like the &quot;official network of the Obama White House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallup itself fretted that its poll showing such a reliance on such an opinionated set of news channels &quot;documents the balkanization of news&quot; - meaning that Americans are digesting very different information on the same events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't help that in broadcast news, the line between news and opinion has been,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the most part, erased. Supposed news anchors now openly advocate for certain public policy positions - and, it seems, certain verdicts in high-profile trials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW (AP) -- Edward Snowden emerged from weeks of hiding in a Moscow airport Friday, still defiant but willing to stop leaking secrets about U.S. surveillance programs if Russia will give him asylum until he can move on to Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowden's meeting with Russian officials and rights activists cleared up uncertainty about where the former National Security Agency systems analyst is, but left open the big question: What comes next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowden said he was ready to meet President Vladimir Putin's condition that he stop leaking secrets if it means Russia would give him shelter that could eventually help him get to Latin America. There was no immediate response from Putin's office, but speakers of both houses of the Kremlin-controlled parliament spoke in support of Snowden's plea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vyacheslav Nikonov, a senior lawmaker with the main Kremlin party, described Snowden as &quot;a bit nervous but smiling&quot; and noted his &quot;perfect haircut.&quot; He said that when asked to describe his stay at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, Snowden answered with one word: &quot;Safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snowden is believed to have been stuck in the airport's transit zone since his arrival on June 23 from Hong Kong, where he had gone before his revelations were made public. He booked a seat on a Cuba-bound flight the next day, but did not get on the plane and had remained out of the public eye until Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Qaida-linked gunmen kill Syrian rebel leader, sign of tension among moderate, jihadists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIRUT (AP) -- Al-Qaida-linked gunmen killed a rebel commander in Syria aligned with the Western-backed militias fighting against Bashar Assad's regime, the highest-profile casualty of growing tensions between moderate and jihadi fighters among rebel forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers worried Friday that the commander's death will increase distrust and suspicion between forces already at odds over territory and leadership as the nearly three-year civil war continues in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loay AlMikdad, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army, said Friday that members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant -- a group reportedly made up of al-Qaida's branches in Iraq and Syria -- were behind the killing of Kamal Hamami. Hamami, known as Abu Basir, served in the Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army, a group headed by a secular-minded moderate that has the support of Western powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said gunmen shot Hamami dead late Thursday after militants tried to remove a checkpoint he set up in the Jabal al-Turkoman mountain in the coastal province of Latakia. The observatory said two of his men were seriously wounded in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AlMikdad told Al-Arabiya TV that Hamami &quot;was assassinated at the hands of the forces of evil and crime at one of the checkpoints.&quot; He added that the group that killed Hamami &quot;should hand over those who carried out this act to stand trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Islamists rallied Friday in cities across Egypt, vowing to sustain for months their campaign to restore deposed President Mohammed Morsi to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days after the military coup that toppled him, however, Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and its allies appear to have failed to bring a significantly wider segment of Egyptian society into the streets on their side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new military-backed administration of interim President Mansour Adly, along with the grand imam of Al-Azhar, the most prominent Sunni Muslim institution, floated offers for &quot;national reconciliation.&quot; Newly appointed Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi is reportedly promising to finish assembling his Cabinet by next week, a government official told Egypt's state news agency. A presidential spokesman has said the Muslim Brotherhood will be offered posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brotherhood remains steadfast in its opposition, saying its supporters will stay in the streets for as long as it takes to force the reinstatement of Morsi, who was overthrown July 3 after four days of massive protests demanding his ouster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the main Islamist rally in Cairo, the crowd poured into a large boulevard in front of the Rabaah al-Adawiya Mosque, where Morsi supporters have been camped for two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury starts deliberating in Zimmerman murder trial; police ask for peace after verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- With police and civic leaders urging calm, a jury began deliberating George Zimmerman's fate Friday after hearing dueling portraits of the neighborhood watch captain: a cop wannabe who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning volunteer who shot Trayvon Martin because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the jury got the murder case, police in this Orlando suburb went on national television to plead for peace in Sanford and across the country, no matter what the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During closing arguments, Zimmerman's lawyers put a concrete slab and two life-size cardboard cutouts in front of the jury box in one last attempt to convince the panel Zimmerman shot the unarmed black 17-year-old in self-defense while his head was being slammed against the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O'Mara used the slab to make the point that it could serve as a weapon. He showed the cutouts of Zimmerman and Martin to demonstrate that the teenager was considerably taller. And he displayed a computer-animated depiction of the fight based on Zimmerman's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 6 dead in France train derailment on eve of major holiday weekend; dozens injured</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRETIGNY-SUR-ORGE, France (AP) -- A train carrying hundreds of passengers derailed and crashed into a station outside Paris on Friday on one of the busiest days of the year for vacation getaways. At least six people were killed and dozens were injured, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crash was the deadliest in France in several years. French President Francois Hollande rushed to the scene at the Bretigny-sur-Orge station, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Paris. The Interior Ministry said some 192 people were either injured or being treated for shock -- of which nine were in a critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the seven train cars slid toward the station, crushing part of the metallic roof over the platform. Images on French television and on Twitter showed gnarled metal and shards on the platform, and debris from the crash clogging the stairwell leading beneath the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 300 firefighters, 20 medical teams and eight helicopters were deployed to get survivors out of the metal wreckage, according to the Interior Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accident came as France is preparing to celebrate its most important national holiday, Bastille Day, on Sunday, and as masses of vacationers are heading out of Paris and other big cities to see family or for summer vacation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say fire truck hit girl after Asiana Airlines crash but it's unclear if that killed her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- One of the two Chinese teenagers killed in the Asiana Airlines disaster was hit by a fire truck while covered with firefighting foam, authorities said Friday, revealing a startling detail that suggested she could have survived the crash only to die in its chaotic aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it wasn't clear whether Ye Meng Yuan, 16, was already dead when the collision occurred or whether the truck killed her moments after Saturday's crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first truck did go over the victim at least one time. Now the other question is what was the cause of death?&quot; police spokesman Albie Esparza said. &quot;That's what we are trying to determine right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other victim, 16-year-old Wang Linjia, was dead when airport staff found her, authorities said Friday. Her body was near three flight attendants who were flung from the back of the plane when it broke open. They all survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said the results of his initial inquiry into the deaths would likely be released sometime next week. The coroner said both bodies arrived directly from the airport. He would not comment on the police investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspect in kidnappings of 3 Ohio women missing for years indicted on hundreds of new charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Month after month, year after year, the decade-long ordeal of three Cleveland women takes shape in the charges against the man accused of imprisoning them: August 2002, kidnapping. October 2005, rape. November 2006, aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christmas Day 2006, rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new 977-count indictment filed Friday provides a numbing look at what prosecutors say was 10 years of captivity for the three women in suspect Ariel Castro's home in a rough Cleveland neighborhood. Among the most serious charges: that he caused the death of one of his victims' fetuses by punching and starving her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most haunting: that he assaulted the women throughout their captivity, causing psychological harm to them and to the daughter he fathered with one of them through assault. And in another newly unveiled accusation, the indictment also alleges that on the same day that the child was born, Christmas of 2006, Castro raped one of the other women, who had helped deliver the baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's indictment moves us closer to resolution of this gruesome case,&quot; Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Tim McGinty said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woman describes 'visions' that led her to dead California boy; authorities confirm her role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Pam Ragland was watching a TV report about the search for an 11-year-old California boy missing in a rural town miles away when she felt something wasn't right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ragland began crying and then a haunting vision popped into her head: A young boy lying on his side with his eyes closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy, Terry Dewayne Smith Jr., wasn't sleeping -- and by the time Ragland's visions stopped, she had led detectives to his decomposing body behind his house in the Riverside County community of Menifee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remains had been partially buried in a shallow grave under a tree more than 60 miles from Ragland's Orange County home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities on Friday decided to charge the boy's 16-year-old half-brother with murder. The teen is due in juvenile court on Monday, and prosecutors have requested a hearing to determine if he should be tried as an adult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt's media embrace military after Morsi ouster, to dismay of press advocates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO (AP) -- When autocrat Hosni Mubarak fell after popular protests in 2011, journalist Sabah Hamamou hoped for change at her newspaper, Al-Ahram, the state-owned media flagship with an editorial line firmly controlled by the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamamou and some of her fellow journalists held demonstrations, issued petitions and pressed editors for the paper to break from state dictates and adopt independent, objective coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change never came. First, the military rulers who took over after Mubarak tightly controlled the paper. Once Mohammed Morsi became president, his Muslim Brotherhood stepped in and pushed coverage their direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened was they just put in their people in Al-Ahram and other state institutions, and nobody tried to reform the institutions themselves,&quot; Hamamou said. &quot;The saying goes if you are confused about who is ruling Egypt, just look at the headlines of Al-Ahram.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Hamamou is dismayed to see the paper and other state media unquestionably embracing the military after its coup that ousted Morsi on July 3, following protests by millions around the country demanding his removal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdict nears in Florida neighbourhood watch murder trial UNITED: Black leaders plead for calm after the verdict in Florida.Photo: Reuters By Dara Kam in Sanford, Florida About a year ago, black leaders and activists took to the streets in Florida and across the country to protest the Sanford police's investigation into the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and to push for the prosecution of neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the jury in Mr Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial expected to start deliberating in Sanford on Friday, many of those same leaders - church elders and community activists - are now joining with police to urge people to remain calm if Mr Zimmerman is found not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been spending a fair amount of time trying to figure out what our role should be in this; how to keep the peace and, if it turns out the worst-case scenario what our next moves should be,&quot; National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People spokesman Derek Turner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're all waiting on edge to hear a verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coincidentally the association is holding its annual convention in Orlando, not far from the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, who is half- Hispanic, shot the unarmed Martin, a hoodie-wearing black, on a drizzly February 26 night in a gated community near Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, the Sanford police originally did not charge Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only after social media outrage and civil rights protests alleging racial profiling and discrimination that Governor Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor, who brought the charges against Mr Zimmerman six weeks after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman's defence before and during the trial has been that he fired the gun in self-defence. If convicted of second-degree murder, the 29-year-old could face life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a late twist in the trial, Judge Debra Nelson said the jury could also consider manslaughter as a lesser charge. This charge is typically included in Florida murder trials at the request of either side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manslaughter with a firearm carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Round-the-clock television coverage of the trial has heightened anticipation about the verdict, and anxiety by some about what the reaction to it might be. Authorities have tagged more than 1 million tweets a day related to the trial as it reached its climax this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broward Sheriff Scott Israel released a video this week pleading with people to &quot;raise their voices, not their hands&quot; and to remain calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr Israel and his staff met black pastors and community leaders on Tuesday to enlist their help in avoiding violence after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no reason to believe there are going to be any issues but forewarned is forearmed,&quot; Mr Israel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami Gardens, where Trayvon&nbsp;Martin lived with his mother, Sybrina Fulton, police, lawyers and community leaders also held a pre- emptive forum this week, as they have throughout Miami-Dade County, where the 1980 acquittal of four Miami-Dade police officers in the death of Arthur McDuffie sparked riots in Overtown and Liberty City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, mayor Jeff Triplett does not anticipate violence. But he said: &quot;You always have the anxiety of these butterflies in your stomach of the 'what ifs.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would hate to think it would take on a different vibe than what we've seen in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His biggest concern was outsiders coming in and causing trouble, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You never know what someone's going to do when they think they're on film or on camera or they've come to a place for one specific purpose and they know nothing else about anything ... That's always a fear. We had that fear last year. That is what keeps me awake at night. Someone coming to our town and saying, 'Watch this'.&quot; Cox Newspapers</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 13--For the past three weeks we have been following the George Zimmerman's murder trial in a Florida courtroom as the defence lawyer tried to paint Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old murder victim, as a weed smoking thug who deserved to die. Left up to the defence, Martin's life was worth less than nothing, especially when compared to that of the superior and privileged white son of a judge, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor and the defence both tried to minimize the impact of race in this case, but is it possible? For starters, a 17-year-old unarmed black teenager was gunned down on his way from the store on a dark rainy night. The perpetrator, a white adult male was not arrested or charged even after admitting to killing the unarmed youth. He was taken into custody by police and then released. It was after international outcry that George Zimmerman was charged with second degree murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the murder victim is portrayed as a worthless ganja smoking menace, whose life is not worth the price of the bullet that killed him. What is wrong with this picture and how did things get to this point? It does not matter if you are white, black, Indian or Chinese, a child has been gunned down in cold blood, and it could have been your child!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race relations in the USA are tense at best. The long history of police abuse and brutality of black Americans secondary to racism is well documented. Additionally, the abuses blacks often suffer at the hands of whites are also well documented. The scary thing is race-based crimes are often downplayed and not dealt with according to the punishment the crime warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember Rodney King? King was beaten to near death by LAPD and even though it was captured on video, the cops got off scot-free, resulting in one of the USA's biggest race riots Also, racists in the Southern United States often get away with atrocious crimes against blacks. So why are they suddenly trying to crucify America's sweetie pie cook show host Paula Deen as a racist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a law suit filed by a black woman, a past employee of Deen and her brother, Paula made the mistake of admitting that she used the 'N' word. Sadly, she is among millions of people both black and white. The difference is Deen admitted it on national TV and the rest were smart enough to deny it. Following her admission to using this racial slur, she was dropped by her TV station and most of her sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She beseeched to the world and cried openly that she is not a racist. Is Paula Deen a racist? Who knows! The fact is, her drama will undoubtedly influence the George Zimmermann's murder trial drama that is currently playing out the Florida courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How exactly will Deen's racist behaviour affect the George Zimmerman murder trial? Your guess is as good as mine. The one thing is for sure is that it forces us as a society to acknowledge that race is a factor in our interaction in America today. We may dress it up in bright red lipstick and fancy weaves and or high heel backless shoes and sexy strapless summer dresses; you may even disguise it behind a law degree or an MBA or even an Armani suit and tie. It is what it is and, until we meet it head on, it will always lurk beneath the surface waiting for an opportunity to shine like the ugly dirty, moldy dime that we are always trying to clean with pricey metal cleaner only the tarnish keeps re-appearing shortly after each cleaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman and Paula Deen are the untreated cancer that has gone untreated in America for so long that it has not only taken root, but has metastasized. The question is, is it terminal?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the jury got the case, Zimmerman's lawyers put a concrete slab and two life-size cardboard cutouts in front of the jury box in one last attempt to convince the panel Zimmerman shot the unarmed 17-year-old Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O'Mara used the slab to make the point that it could be used as a weapon. He showed cutouts of Zimmerman, 29, and Martin to demonstrate that the teenager was considerably taller and he displayed a computer-animated depiction of the fight based on Zimmerman's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said prosecutors hadn't met their burden of proving Zimmerman's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, he said, the murder case was built on &quot;could've beens&quot; and &quot;maybes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn't been proven, it's just not there,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;You can't fill in the gaps. You can't connect the dots. You're not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rebuttal, prosecutor John Guy accused Zimmerman of telling &quot;so many lies.&quot; He said Martin's last emotion was one of fear as Zimmerman followed him in a neighborhood of townhomes on a rainy night Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that every child's worst nightmare, to be followed on the way home in the dark by a stranger?&quot; Guy said. &quot;Isn't that every child's worst fear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women will have to sort through a lot conflicting testimony from police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury also will be allowed to consider manslaughter. Under Florida's laws involving gun crimes, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second-degree murder: life in prison.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A county religious leader is asking for calm upon the announcement of a verdict in the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin murder trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Lee Thomas, a bishop in Glen Burnie's Empowering Believers Church of the Apostolic Faith, has asked Anne Arundel county residents to &quot;respect the laws of the land&quot; once a verdict is announced. Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of 17-year old Martin in 2012. Jurors are scheduled to resume deliberations in the case Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the lines that are being drawn concerning guilty or not guilty, we're just asking that, no matter what the verdict, people allow the system of justice to be the voice,&quot; Thomas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Christian Clergy Alliance, North County Christian Clergy, Churches United Cluster, and the NAACP joined Thomas in his message of prayer and peace in anticipation of the verdict.</SPAN></P>

Six women have an unenviable task: Measure justice in the case of a neighborhood watch captain who kills an unarmed teenager.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationally engrossing for its commentary on race relations and gun rights, the trial of George Zimmerman for the murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin inched closer to resolution on Saturday as six jurors - all women, five of them mothers - continued to deliberate the extent to which, if any, Mr. Zimmerman bore responsibility for the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, or whether he lawfully defended himself from an attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the middle of the Zimmerman murder trial is a cone of silence, a two minute span that was never illuminated or explained during the trial by the lone survivor of a deadly encounter between two people - one an armed neighborhood watch captain, the other a black teenager minding his own business - on a rainy winter night in Sanford, Florida, in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors have three paths they can take as a group: Murder 2, if they find Zimmerman had, as prosecutor John Guy said, &quot;hate in his heart&quot; when he followed, confronted, then shot Trayvon after a fight; manslaughter, if they find Zimmerman acted recklessly and without justification; and not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts who watched the entirety of the trial, which ended with closing arguments on Thursday and Friday, say that within those options lies the potential for a just verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Juries are famous for coming back with compromised verdicts, which means they have different ideas about what the evidence is,&quot; says Bob Dekle, a trial expert and law professor at the University of Florida, in Gainesville. &quot;But even in those cases, what often happens is they work out a middle ground, which in this case could be manslaughter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dekle, Zimmerman has a solid self-defense case, given injuries to his nose and face. But the jury, he says, may also, within the boundaries of manslaughter, find that he exhibited &quot;culpable negligence&quot; - in other words, that his negligent decisions set in motion a series of events that culminated with the death of a person legally defined as a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is that when a grown man, frustrated, angry, with hate in his heart, gets out of his car with a loaded gun and follows a child?&quot; said prosecutor John Guy, who had the last word to the jury before they took the case Friday. &quot;A stranger? In the dark? And shoots him through his heart? What is that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense says it was Martin who stalked Zimmerman after Zimmerman got out of his car to look for an address, sucker punched him, and then beat his head on a concrete sidewalk. Though he had gone to a boxing gym for 18 months, Zimmerman, who had 40 pounds on the 158 pound Trayvon, didn't have the physical ability or technical prowess to fight back, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many 'coulda beens' have you heard from the state in this case,&quot; defense attorney Mark O'Mara queried the jury. &quot;Do not give anybody the benefit of the doubt except for George Zimmerman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, of course, could not testify, as the prosecutors maintained more than once. Zimmerman chose not to testify, allowing previously recorded interviews with police and media to speak for him in the courtroom. Judge Debra Nelson told jurors that they could not allow Zimmerman's decision to remain silent sway their verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That left jurors to wade through an avalanche of emotional and often contradictory testimony, ranging from the identity of a desperate scream for help caught on a 911 recording to the meaning of Zimmerman's observations on a 911 nonemergency call about &quot;[expletive] punks&quot; who &quot;always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other open questions for the jury include trying to determine who actually started the fight and whether Zimmerman, as the prosecution contends, consistently lied to police about the sequence of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors have been engaged. When Guy showed, not for the first time, an autopsy picture of Trayvon's face, one of the youngest jurors cried. When prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda straddled a man-sized felt dummy to illustrate what he saw as inconsistencies in Zimmerman's explanation of what happened, all the jurors stood up to see better, with one juror stepping slightly out of the jury box to get a closer look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women of the jury include a Hispanic nursing home nurse, a 30-something parrot owner, a middle-aged woman who told the judge she &quot;wants a fair trial,&quot; and another middle-aged white woman who told the judge she'll urge jurors to only consider introduced evidence, but also noted that, &quot;You have a responsibility if you bear arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense wants the jury to focus only on Zimmerman's story of how he was attacked and beaten. The prosecution wants the jury to look at Trayvon's death in its totality, and to consider what a not guilty verdict would mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy told the jury that if Zimmerman is acquitted it will signal to society that it's okay for grown men to follow and chase children, and kill them if they put up a fight.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- No one was arrested during a march late Saturday night throughout downtown Oakland, when some in a crowd of about 100 people broke windows, vandalized cars and buildings with spray paint and started fires in the street in protest of George Zimmerman's acquittal hours earlier in a Florida courtroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The atmosphere was tense, with some marchers attempting to start fights and police dressed in riot gear in front of the police department headquarters, according to staff photographer Anda Chu. Footage from television helicopters showed protesters trashing a police squad car and a line of police blocking the protesters' path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occupy Oakland organized the gathering over Twitter at 10 p.m., encouraging protesters to wear hoodies, as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did when he was shot to death by Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some protesters held a banner declaring: &quot;We Are All Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; Others spray-painted anti-police graffiti throughout Frank Ogawa Plaza, while a small contingent of officers looked on from afar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group began to march around 11 p.m. and some began breaking windows, including some on the Oakland Tribune downtown offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One BART police car was also vandalized with spray paint and its windows were smashed. Protesters also burned an American and a California state flag at a McDonald's restaurant on 14th and Jackson streets and spray painted Alameda County's Davidson courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said no one was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oakland protest followed a San Francisco rally by a couple hundred people who marched peacefully from the Mission and 24th Street BART station to 16th Street and back over a two-hour period while a dozen police vehicles escorted them. After some loud protests, San Francisco organizers ended their march around 10 p.m., asking participants to return Sunday at Powell and Market streets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media was abuzz late Saturday with reaction to the acquittal of George Zimmerman. Antioch police chief Allan Cantando posted a lengthy response to the verdict and the life of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on his department's Facebook page. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is the entire message:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict was released to the public. The verdict &quot;Not Guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I must admit I did not follow this case on a daily basis....I heard excerpts from the case and formed my own very limited opinions as the case moved through our court system. I had no idea of what verdict the jury would reach. I was optimistic the jury would be everything a jury should be...fair...impartial...and willing to have the integrity to live with their decision of &quot;justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spent today with family and friends in the comfort of my backyard, but once I heard of the decision, I watched my television intently. I must tell you I was emotional after hearing the verdict for many reasons. Not because I agreed or disagreed with the jury, but rather I knew the emotions so many of US would experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young boy lost his life, a family lost a son, a brother.... friends lost a friend, a man on trial for his life was vindicated through our justice system. Cities throughout this nation are asking &quot;was justice served?&quot;-- what will be the aftermath once the masses learn of the verdict....and so much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I then heard the attorney for the Martin family, Benjamin Crump, speak. Although Mr. Crump has been addressing media during this trial on behalf of the Martin family, I cannot tell you how his message after the verdict tonight positively impacted me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Crump noted the family was not at the courthouse, but rather in their church when the verdict was read. Although I am simplifying his message, he relayed the family wanted to be around family and friends when the verdict was read. The family wanted to have peace after the verdict. Mr. Crump was bated by the media multiple times to say negative things about this case...the defense....the Judge.....HE DIDN'T!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Crump showed amazing integrity which I will always admire and will strive to exemplify. In this case, Mr. Crump is a professional in every sense of the word. Mr. Crump talked about the race relations in this country and quite candidly said they cannot be ignored. Mr. Crump is right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Crump talked about his conversation with a relative of Dr. Martin Luther King's family today and noted no matter what the verdict, the response must be peace and continue to work towards Dr. King's dream.......Mr. Crump is walking that path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of your opinion on the verdict today, understand that this case has impacted America as a whole. My sympathies go out to the Martin family....I can't imagine the loss you have experienced. The Zimmerman family can get on with their lives and hopefully move past this incident. I truly hope these families find peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tomorrow is another day and I am optimistic we all understand how this single event has impacted us all. When we wake up tomorrow, I am hopeful we will reflect where, we as a society have been...where we are....and where we want to be. I am confident we have all learned something about ourselves as we reflect on this incident, and that is a good thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sincerely,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Allan Cantando</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Sanford, Fla. GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S fate is in the hands of an all-woman jury after his defense team and prosecutors on Friday got their last licks in the racially charged case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While only one juror is a member of a minority, five of the panelists are moms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And several of them looked uneasy when a photograph of slain 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin flashed on a screen in the Florida courtroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no witnesses to the Feb. 26, 2012, struggle in an Orlando-area town house complex that ended with Martin dead with a bullet in his chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the panelists - who got their final instructions from Judge Debra Nelson - will have to rely on the often conflicting testimony of 58 witnesses who prosecutors and defense attorneys put on the stand during the two-week trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury completed its first abbreviated day of deliberations without reaching a verdict and will resume Saturday. Members can find Zimmerman, 29, guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter, or they can acquit him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder and could get up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nelson, over the loud objections of Team Zimmerman, has also given the jury the option of convicting the neighborhood watchman of manslaughter. Zimmerman could get 25 years to life in prison if convicted on that charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the jury got the case, lawyers from both sides took the panel through the evidence again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lead defense attorney, Mark O'Mara, went first, insisting Zimmerman is &quot;not guilty of anything but protecting his own life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, he said, sowed the seeds of his own destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know he had the opportunity to go home, and he didn't do that,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;The person who decided to make the night violent was the guy who didn't go home when he had the chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were four minutes from the moment Zimmerman reported to a police dispatcher that Martin was &quot;running&quot; to the moment when a resident called 911 to report a fight in progress, O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To demonstrate that, O'Mara then said nothing for four minutes as Zimmerman nervously mopped his brow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four minutes,&quot; O'Mara told the jury. &quot;That felt like a long time. Four minutes to what? To walk home? To run home?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Martin didn't do that, the lawyer said. He circled back and attacked Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors have not produced &quot;a shred of evidence&quot; in this &quot;bizarro case&quot; to show that Zimmerman had any other option but to shoot the teenager, O'Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara did not mention that Martin was black or that Zimmerman is part Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, O'Mara said there was no malice in Zimmerman's voice when he first reported to a 911 dispatcher that a suspicious teenager was wandering through the development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But O'Mara, in his argument, scrubbed the foul language Zimmerman used in the call when he told the dispatcher, &quot;F---ing punks ... These a--holes, they always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was followed by prosecutor John Guy who argued that Zimmerman lied &quot;over and over and over&quot; about what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman had listened when a police dispatcher told him it wasn't necessary to keep tailing Martin, &quot;none of us would be here,&quot; Guy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That child had every right to be afraid of a strange man following him,&quot; Guy said. &quot;And did that child not have the right to defend himself from that strange man?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy also waded into territory O'Mara avoided, stating flatly that &quot;this case is not about race, this is about right and wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Guy left the jury something to think about: &quot;What if it was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin who shot and killed George Zimmerman? What would your verdict be?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's how you know it's not about race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial refusal by Sanford police and prosecutors to charge Zimmerman with a crime is the chief reason why the fatal shooting exploded into a national story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview after the shooting with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Zimmerman explained what happened by saying, &quot;I feel like it was all God's plan.&quot; He then apologized to Martin's parents and said he was not racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's angry dad, Tracy Martin, rejected Zimmerman's words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no way that my God wanted George Zimmerman to murder my teenage son,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undeniable truth of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is that, based on fevered assumptions about a 17-year-old black teenager, George Zimmerman provoked a confrontation in which he ended up shooting a young man to death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Zimmerman's trial closed Friday, his defense lawyer declared in summation that the unarmed Martin was to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know he had the opportunity to go home, and he didn't do that,&quot; Mark O'Mara said, brazenly turning the world on its head. &quot;The person who decided to make the night violent was the guy who didn't go home when he had the chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-member jury will decide whether prosecutors met the burden of proving that Zimmerman's actions fit the definitions of either second-degree murder or manslaughter. Those judgments will entail wrestling with whether, in the end, Zimmerman can be credited with shooting Martin in self-defense, however culpable Zimmerman's own conduct was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That he bears damnable responsibility, as distinct from legal guilt, for Martin's death is clear. Zimmerman alone instigated what happened in Sanford, Fla., on the night of Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was scouting for burglars on neighborhood watch and, of critical importance, he carried a gun. Spotting Martin, he profiled a black teenager in a hoodie as a likely criminal. In fact, Martin was merely returning home from the store with a soda and a package of Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman shadowed Martin and continued to do so after being instructed to stop by a police dispatcher. At one point, Martin told his girlfriend by cellphone that a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; was following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened next may never be known and is at the heart of the jury's deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claimed in pre-trial statements that Trayvon suddenly punched him, pinned him to the ground, knocked his head against the sidewalk and grabbed for Zimmerman's gun. It was then, Zimmerman said, that he shot Trayvon out of fear for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors poked holes in this story - noting, for example, that Zimmerman's modest head wounds were hardly consistent with the violent struggle he described. But, since no one else alive witnessed the fight, the only word anyone has is the killer's. Plus his lawyer's blame-the-victim contention that everything went wrong because Martin didn't just walk home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Zimmerman groundlessly presumed the worst about a teenager who was doing nothing wrong. After Zimmerman took it upon himself to play cop after the real cops had told him to stand down. After Zimmerman brought a gun to a confrontation that could easily escalate into a fatality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the jury's verdict, Zimmerman started it that night - and finished it with a bullet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Attorney Angela Corey fired her office's information technology director Friday after he testified last month about being concerned prosecutors did not turn over information to George Zimmerman's defense team in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day attorneys finished their closing arguments in that nationally watched trial, a state attorney investigator went to Ben Kruidbos' home about 7:30 a.m. to hand-deliver a letter stating Kruidbos &quot;can never again be trusted to step foot in this office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter contended Kruibos did a poor job overseeing the information technology department, violated public records law for retaining documents, and noted he was questioned in March when the office was trying to determine who had leaked personnel information obtained through a computer breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview Friday, Kruidbos denied the allegations in the letter, which was written by Cheryl Peek, the managing director of the State Attorney's Office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had acted in good faith about &quot;genuine concerns.&quot; He said he had been proud to work at the State Attorney's Office and feared the letter would cripple his chances at finding another job to support his family, including a 4-month-old son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have any regrets,&quot; he said, &quot;but I am terrified about the future and what that will end up being.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His attorney Wesley White - who resigned from the State Attorney's Office in December and is a critic of Corey - said the firing was aimed at sending a message to office employees &quot;that if they feel like there is wrongdoing,&quot; they should not disclose it or seek legal guidance from a private attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they do speak to an attorney, then they are dead,&quot; he said. &quot;The State Attorney's Office will do whatever is necessary to not only terminate them, but destroy their reputations in the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Attorney spokeswoman Jackelyn Barnard did not return phone calls or emails for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos, 42, had been on paid administrative leave since May 28 from his $80,892 job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, he used computer software technology to extract photographs and text messages from the source file in Martin's cellphone. Kruidbos was able to recover more information than the Florida Department of Law Enforcement obtained previously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTING LEGAL ADVICE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos said he became concerned that lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda might not have turned over Kruidbos' report to defense attorneys. Kruidbos asked White in April for legal advice and described some contents of his report such as a photo of an African-American hand holding a gun, a photo of a plant resembling marijuana, and a text message referring to a gun transaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White then contacted one of Zimmerman's attorneys and learned the defense had not received the report generated by Kruidbos. The defense did receive the source file from the cellphone and used its own experts to extract data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Zimmerman's attorneys subpoenaed both White and Kruidbos during a pretrial hearing on their motion seeking sanctions against prosecutors. Circuit Judge Debra Nelson deferred a ruling until after the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Kruidbos' name surfaced in the Martin trial proceedings, he received a pay raise for &quot;meritorious performance,&quot; according to a document dated May 16 in his personnel file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the dismissal letter written by Peek contends he did his job poorly as information technology director and said he should have asked someone in the office about his concerns regarding the Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your egregious lack of regard for the sensitive nature of the information handled by this office is completely abhorrent,&quot; Peek wrote. &quot;You have proven to be completely untrustworthy. Because of your deliberate, wilful and unscrupulous actions, you can never again be trusted to step foot in this office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter said Kruidbos &quot;apparently questioned the ethics&quot; of de la Rionda, who has been an assistant state attorney since 1983. &quot;His record as an honorable and respected attorney is unblemished and beyond reproach,&quot; Peek wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos said the question of de la Rionda's ethics &quot;is not really my place to decide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he asked White for legal advice because he was concerned he could face &quot;legal exposure&quot; if the cellphone report wasn't turned over to the defense before the trial started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he did not feel comfortable posing that question to anyone within the office because the State Attorney's Office had just conducted an in-house probe of whether someone was leaking personnel information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFFICE 'PARANOIA'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It felt like everyone was on heightened sensitivity,&quot; Kruidbos said. &quot;It felt like the paranoia in the office had gotten worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the office investigated a security breach involving someone hacking computers to obtain disciplinary matters and personal health information about employees, according to Peek's letter. That investigation followed news reports in February that Corey approved using about $342,000 in taxpayer dollars to upgrade pensions for herself and de la Rionda. Kruidbos said the investigation might have stemmed from the stories about the pensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos said office administrators told him that he and Richard Komando, who was executive director of the office, were suspected of improperly obtaining the information. Komando resigned April 4. Kruidbos said he does not believe Komando was involved because &quot;it makes no sense. He worked very hard to get to where he was. He had nothing to gain from that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos had his job duties changed on April 3, removing eight employees from his supervision and curtailing his access to the computer system. But the investigation did not find he was involved in the computer breach or leaking any information. He has denied any involvement and testified last month to that effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for why he did not approach Corey about his concerns in the Martin case, Kruidbos said Corey has a close relationship with de la Rionda and &quot;any attempt by me to go to them and say I think something wrong has happened would not have been taken seriously, and then ultimately held against me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I consulted an attorney, which is my right,&quot; he said. &quot;I had concerns about what I had seen at work, and this was just how it ended up playing out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey and others learned Kruidbos had hired White as his attorney when White, subpoenaed by the defense, identified Kruidbos by name at a May 28 hearing. Corey put Kruidbos on paid leave that same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peek's letter contends that on May 24, Kruidbos wiped clean the information on a computer assigned to him, thereby violating public records law. Kruidbos said he does not know what computer is referred to by the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the computer network stores information on a number of backup systems in addition to personal computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White has a contentious relationship with Corey, but Kruidbos said that wasn't a factor in him hiring White, whom he described as a &quot;good lawyer who does the right thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White said he and Kruidbos are reviewing their legal options in response to the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White said he wants an outside review by a state attorney from another circuit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six anonymous women began deliberating on Friday whether to convict George Zimmerman for the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in a case that has captivated and divided the U.S. public for the past 16 months.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After presiding over 12 days of testimony and two days of closing arguments, Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson turned the case over to a jury sequestered since the trial began last month. They broke for the day Friday without reaching a verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will try to settle a case that has dominated U.S. media, sparked street demonstrations and raised questions about race and guns in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jurors must reach a unanimous verdict on either second-degree murder, manslaughter or acquittal. A deadlocked jury would result in a mistrial, possibly leading to the whole courtroom drama unfolding once again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Zimmerman, 29, says he shot Mr. Martin in self-defence after he was attacked on the rainy night of Feb. 26, 2012, in the central Florida town of Sanford. Prosecutors contend Mr. Zimmerman was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who tracked down the teenager and shot him without justification. Mr. Zimmerman's family appealed for calm, whatever the verdict, saying they had complete trust in the U.S. justice system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As we await a verdict we will remain hopeful and ask for the public to remain peaceful no matter the outcome,&quot; they said in a statement to CNN. &quot;The judicial system has run its course, pray for justice, pray for peace, pray for our country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In closing arguments on Friday, lead defence lawyer Mark O'Mara attempted to shift the blame to Mr. Martin, saying he was the aggressor who attacked Mr. Zimmerman after lying in wait. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To convict Mr. Zimmerman of second-degree murder, which could lead to a sentence of life in prison, the jury must find he acted with ill will, spite or hatred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The jury can also opt for manslaughter, which has a lesser burden of culpable negligence. That carries a prison sentence of up to 30 years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutors had one final rebuttal, when John Guy told the jury: &quot;The defendant didn't shoot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he had to. He shot him because he wanted to. That's the bottom line.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When police initially declined to arrest Mr. Zimmerman, believing his account of self-defence, it provoked demonstrations, first in Sanford's black neighbourhood of Goldsboro, where people accused Mr. Zimmerman of racial profiling and demanded his arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests spread to small towns and big cities across the United States, prompting celebrity tweets, cable news shouting matches and scrutiny of Florida's Stand Your Ground self-defence law, which police cited in letting Mr. Zimmerman to go free. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case drew the attention of President Barack Obama, who said: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sanford, officials said on Friday they were prepared for a possible return of the impassioned demonstrations that arose last year, but expected calm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will not tolerate anyone who uses the verdict as an excuse to violate the law,&quot; Sheriff Donald Eslinger told reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jury deliberations resume again at 9 a.m. Saturday. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors continue deliberations in contentious second-degree murder case over death of black teenager Trayvon Martin&nbsp;<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors in George Zimmerman's second-degree murder case in Florida resumed their deliberations for a second day on Saturday, as the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson issued a public appeal for calm ahead of a potential verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel of six women returned to the courthouse in Sanford at 9am, to continue sifting through almost three weeks of testimony and evidence from the neighbourhood watch leader's trial for shooting Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. Police in Sanford and Miami, Martin's home town, say they are prepared for the possibility of unrest if Zimmerman, 29, is acquitted, and insist they will not tolerate a violent reaction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reverend Jackson was one of the black leaders who led peaceful protests in Sanford and elsewhere soon after the shooting on 26 February last year, when Zimmerman was originally released without charge. Speaking at a peace rally in Chicago, and in a series of Tweets, Jackson said the public reaction to the verdict, whichever way it goes, needs to be tempered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Zimmerman is convicted, there should not be inappropriate celebrations because a young man lost his life,&quot; he said. &quot;If Zimmerman is not convicted, avoid violence because it only leads to more tragedies. Self-destruction is not the road to reconstruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's family also released a statement calling for restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury deliberated for about three and a half hours on Friday, before breaking for the night. Almost two hours into their discussions they sent a note to judge Debra Nelson, asking for a detailed inventory of all the physical evidence from the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who is of mixed Hispanic-white parentage, admits shooting Martin, 17, in a confrontation at the Retreat at Twin Lakes gated housing development but denies murder on the grounds of self-defence. Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead attorney, told the jury that he had the right to shoot because Martin attacked his client with a &quot;sucker punch&quot; and was straddling him on the ground, smashing his head on to a concrete pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors portrayed Zimmerman as an overzealous vigilante who mistook the hoodie-wearing teenager for a criminal as he walked home in the rain from a convenience store, at which he had purchased a soft drink and sweets. In his closing arguments, state attorney Bernie de la Rionda said Zimmerman made a number of wrong &quot;assumptions&quot; about Martin and disobeyed a command from a police dispatcher not to follow or confront him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case brought issues of race, Florida's controversial gun laws and the right of a person to stand their ground into sharp focus. As the protests grew, the state's governor, Rick Scott, appointed a special prosecutor, Angela Corey, to re-examine the evidence, leading to Zimmerman being arrested and charged six weeks after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors have three options - convicting Zimmerman of murder, which carries a sentence of at least 25 years; finding him guilty of manslaughter, carrying a penalty of between 10 and 30 years; or acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protestors began to gather at the courthouse in Central Florida soon after the jury, consisting of five white women and one Hispanic, was sent out to begin its deliberations at 2.30pm on Friday. Other than a few forceful verbal exchanges with a handful of Zimmerman supporters, the gathering was peaceful. Dozens of officers from the Sanford police department and Seminole County Sheriff's Office are providing extra security at the courthouse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After hearing the verdict, Judge Debra Nelson told Zimmerman he was free to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors heard two different portraits of Zimmerman and had to decide whether he was a wannabe cop who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning neighborhood watch volunteer who shot the unarmed teenager in self-defense because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial and its aftermath received robust cable coverage, with CNN's Piers Morgan interviewing Zimmeman's brother, Robert Zimmerman. The brother of the newly freed man said George Zimmerman was still processing his freedom. George Howell, Martin Savidge and David Mattingly were reporting from the ground during the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On MSNBC, Al Sharpton, Melissa Harris Perry, and Lisa Bloom discussed the role race played in the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the key ways we know this is about race is in this moment black families are holding theirs sons and daughters closer to them with the sense that this verdict&amp;hellip;feels very much as though it is saying 'it is acceptable, it is OK' to kill an unarmed, African American child who has committed no crime,&quot; Perry said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At any one time America - if the ever-looping news channels are a proxy for US public opinion - is absorbed by a number of murder trials as the gruesome nature of the crimes are drip-fed each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May a jury in Arizona found Jodi Arias, a 32-year-old aspiring saleswoman and photographer, guilty of first-degree murder in the shooting and stabbing of former boyfriend Travis Alexander (30) in 2008.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The macabre sexual details of the crime and Arias's portrayal as a femme fatale masquerading as a woman of faith made the trial tabloid television gold. One  network even ran mock deliberations by viewer-jurors as the actual jury in the trial was hearing evidence in the case in what proved to be a major ratings winner for HLN, sister channel of CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing trial of Boston Irish mob boss James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger (83) has drawn similar attention, though the prohibition of cameras from the courtroom limits the graphic details of the 19 murders Bulger is alleged to have had a role in to descriptive court reports rather than televised evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the outset of the trial last month, the former fugitive's defence lawyer denied that Bulger was an FBI informant because, as an Irishman and given the experience of the Irish in the history of the Troubles, there was nothing worse than being a rat. The lawyer also maintained that Bulger didn't kill women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the criminal underworld, with its warped code of honour, there seems to be nothing worse than being a rat or a woman-killer. No such reservations were expressed about Bulger's involvement in racketeering, drug-dealing, extortion or the murders of 17 men in the 1970s and 1980s.Claddagh ringThis week in the trial a Massachusetts state forensic anthropologist showed the jury gruesome photographs of the remains of several bodies found in shallow graves in the Boston area. The photographs included the image of a claddagh ring on the decomposed finger bone of one of Bulger's alleged victims. Prosecutors went so far as to ask whether the heart was facing inwards or outwards. This is Boston after all, one of the most Irish cities in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One high-profile courtroom drama that reached its final stages yesterday is the trial of George Zimmerman (29), a neighbourhood watchman in Florida charged with second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, on the night of February 26th, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a trial where race and profiling bubbles under the surface, prosecutors have argued  Martin died because Zimmerman was &quot;a wannabe cop&quot; who assumed Mr Martin was a criminal and provoked the teenager into a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although prosecutors have not explicitly referred to it, race is an underlying issue. In closing remarks on Thursday, prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda alleged that Zimmerman had assumed that the African-American teenager in a hooded sweatshirt was in the neighbourhood to cause trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is dead because another man made assumptions,&quot; she said, &quot;because his assumptions were wrong.&quot;Self-defenceZimmerman's defence is self-defence - that he was protecting himself after Martin knocked him to the ground, punched him and slammed his head repeatedly against a pavement. Fearing that Martin was reaching for Zimmerman's legally-held concealed gun in his waistband, he shot the teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though Zimmerman is part Latino (his mother is Peruvian) his defence has chosen not to publicly identify with his Hispanic roots to stress that self-defence, not race, is at the centre of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Good, a neighbour, testified that he saw someone in dark clothing straddling someone with lighter skin in what he described as a &quot;ground and pound&quot; position, supporting Zimmerman's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's friend Rachel Jeantel recounted in evidence how Martin told her in a phone conversation shortly before he was shot that he was being followed by a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial has had its bizarre moments. Defence lawyer Don West tried to curry favour with jurors in his opening statement with a joke: &quot;Knock, knock. Who's there? George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman who? All right, good, you're on the jury.&quot; He apologised to the jury later in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury will shortly begin its deliberations in the trial, while police in southern Florida are preparing for any protests or civil unrest if Zimmerman walks away a free man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting last year and six-week delay in Zimmerman's arrest provoked anger among leaders fighting for equal rights for African-Americans within what they claim is a biased US justice system. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 13--Not since the trial of O.J. Simpson has a criminal case tinged with race riveted the country the way the George Zimmerman trial in Florida has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vernellia Randall, a local law expert in race relations, said the case fascinates people because it challenges views of what constitutes racism, particularly among people who strongly want to believe we have a color-blind society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have said race was involved in the delay in charging Zimmerman after he shot and killed an unarmed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, claiming self-defense. Others wonder why more attention has not been focused on Zimmerman's right to defend himself when allegedly threatened by Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict could come any day as jurors began deliberations Friday afternoon, and local residents have been paying close attention to what's happened inside that Orlando suburb courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could go both ways,&quot; Kristina Butler, of West Chester Twp., said of the verdict. &quot;I think it's a shame a young man was gunned down. I want to believe (Zimmerman), but there's too much racial prejudice in the world today, so I think the facts need to speak for themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall said Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was threatening because of his color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because he was a young black man walking in a place where he was perceived not to belong,&quot; she said, adding the same thing could happen to a white man in a predominately black neighborhood, as &quot;we get suspicious. Is that racism? I think it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the outcome would have been different, she said, if a black man had followed a white man because he found him suspicious, and the white man was shot to death. In that case, Randall said, it would be &quot;impossible to imagine&quot; that the black man wouldn't be arrested immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second degree murder. On the night of the scuffle in February 2012, Martin was visiting his father and his father's fiancee at the same townhouse complex where Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman observed Martin while driving in his neighborhood, called police and the fight ensued after the neighborhood watch volunteer got out of his vehicle. Zimmerman claims Martin was slamming his head into the concrete pavement when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though prosecutors said Zimmerman &quot;assumed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a criminal,&quot; Randall said that explanation leaves out why -- because Martin was black -- and that factor is what is driving public interest in the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of racial motivations is separate from the question of whether Zimmerman is guilty of murder, or as added Thursday, of manslaughter, Randall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is what we're not discussing, and we're using this trial as a proxy for it,&quot; she said. &quot;And I think that's a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Amend, of Hamilton, said he believes the trial is definitely racially motivated and that the jury should find Zimmerman not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he was stupid, but it was self-defense,&quot; Amend said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other area residents said they haven't made up their minds about how the case should be decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were both in the wrong in the sense that, do I believe he should've been shot? No. But do I think Zimmerman was scared and used self-defense? Yes,&quot; said Madison Johnson, of Cincinnati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said she believes if Zimmerman were black and Martin were white, this case would not be getting the same media attention, nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen Hart, a Xavier University psychology professor, said the news media is partly to blame for sensationalizing the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a cyclical thing. If it gets reported to us every night, people are going to comment or radio talk show hosts will bring it up, and of course, people will voice their opinions,&quot; Hart said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Judge Debra Nelson ruled that jurors can consider the lesser charge of manslaughter, as requested by prosecutors, and that was included in the jury instructions Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Hagel, a University of Dayton law professor, said the instruction allows for a &quot;compromise verdict,&quot; allowing the jury to go with another option if jurors find that prosecutors didn't make the case for murder, but don't want to let Zimmerman go completely free. He said jurors probably felt &quot;incredible pressure,&quot; given the national attention the case has garnered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whatever the decision jurors reach, most of those interviewed by this newspaper said there will be a public uproar. During the 44 days police waited to arrest Zimmerman, there were marches and protests around the country, including some in southwest Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be protests, people carrying signs and yelling in Florida because no matter what the verdict is, there are people who believe Trayvon was completely innocent and this is yet another indicator of continuing racism,&quot; Hart said. &quot;Then there are people on the other side who feel George Zimmerman is unfairly prosecuted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe the protests will turn violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will probably be riots,&quot; Amend said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are going to be upset,&quot;Johnson said. &quot;Either way, people will freak out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While security around the courthouse will most likely be heightened, many think that Zimmerman will need protection regardless of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If found innocent, he won't survive it,&quot; Butler said. &quot;I think he won't be safe no matter where he goes. He's not going to be safe if he goes to prison and he's not going to be safe if free and walking the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - The jury in George Zimmerman's murder trial began a second day of deliberations Saturday morning, weighing whether the neighborhood watch volunteer committed a crime almost a year and a half ago when he fatally shot Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors reconvened in the courtroom at 9 a.m. Saturday. A few smiled as the judge addressed them before they left the courtroom to continue their discussions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two dozen people gathered outside the courthouse awaiting a verdict, with supporters of the Martin family outnumbering those there for Zimmerman. One man held a sign that read, &quot;We love you George.&quot; A woman lay in the grass in a hoodie, her arms spread, in a re-creation of Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Twitter, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, shared what she called her favorite Bible verse: &quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday afternoon, as the jury began deliberations, police and civic leaders in this Orlando suburb went on national television to plead for calm in Sanford and across the country if Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, is acquitted. Martin was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, people protested in Sanford and across the country last year when authorities waited 44 days before arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury also is allowed to consider manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge's decision to allow that consideration was a potentially heavy blow to the defense: It could give jurors who aren't convinced the shooting amounted to murder a way to hold Zimmerman responsible for the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman faces a maximum prison sentence of life for second-degree murder and 30 years if convicted of manslaughter, due to extra sentencing guidelines for committing a crime with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women - all but one of them white - must sort through conflicting testimony from police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors deliberated for three and a half hours when they decided to stop Friday evening. About two hours into their discussions, they asked for a list of the evidence. Their identities are being kept anonymous - they are identified only by number - but they revealed information about themselves during jury selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- B-51 is retired, not married and doesn't have kids. She has worked in real estate and run a call center where she said she had experience resolving conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- B-29 recently moved to central Florida from Chicago. She works as a nurse on an Alzheimer's section of a nursing home. She is married and has several children. A prosecutor described her as &quot;black or Hispanic&quot; during jury selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- B-76 is a white woman who has lived in central Florida for 18 years. She manages rental properties with her husband of 30 years. She has two adult children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- B-37 is a white woman who volunteers rescuing animals. She is married to an attorney and has two adult children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- E-6 is married and has two children. She has worked in financial services and is active in her church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- E-40 works as a safety officer and recently moved to Seminole County from Iowa.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida jurors deciding the fate of George Zimmerman,the neighborhood watch member who shot and killed unarmed black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin last year, could have a tough task when it comes to sorting out flawed testimony and conflicting evidence, East Tennessee law experts said Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best I can tell, there's been insufficient evidence for the prosecution to get a conviction on any of the theories, second-degree murder or manslaughter, and there's not enough evidence for the defense to claim self-defense,&quot; said Dwight Aarons, a criminal law professor at the University of Tennessee.<BR>Zimmerman, 29, has been charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter in the shooting.<BR>The investigation and monthlong trial have been extensively covered by national media, in part because of early claims of racial profiling.<BR>Zimmerman's lawyers have painted 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a street-smart thug who slammed Zimmerman's head against the pavement, making him fear for his life. The prosecution has cast Martin as a harmless teen who was carrying skittles and iced tea when he was gunned down by an overzealous cop wannabe.<BR>&quot;I think both sides have had a tough time in this case in the sense of proving murder or proving self-defense, because I don't think the full truth has come out,&quot; said Melanie Reid, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami and current law professor at Lincoln Memorial University. &quot;We haven't seen the full fight, just little pieces of it. So as much as we'd like to see justice and truth come out at a trial, sometimes that's just not possible.&quot;<BR>Both Zimmerman's and Martin's mothers claimed to hear their sons screaming for help in the background of 911 recordings. Zimmerman did not take the stand, but the defense offered up witnesses who spoke to him after the shooting.<BR>&quot;He's the guy who, one would think, the jury is just strongly desiring to hear from because he's the only one other than the victim who was there,&quot; said Aarons. &quot;They would have a friend come in and say 'He told me this,' but the guy is sitting right across the room. It's a clever way of having his words in the courtroom without having him on the stand.&quot;<BR>Reid and Aarons said the verdict delivered by the panel of six women could go either way, though the judge's decision this week to include the option of a manslaughter charge could make a conviction easier.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Trial Ends: George Zimmerman's Family Releases StatementAs they settle in for what could be a long, extremely tense waiting period until the verdict is delivered, Zimmerman's family released a statement admitting that they have no choice but to put their faith in the legal system. <BR>Expressing trust in the system, the Zimmerman family stated: <BR>From the onset of this tragic event, our family has been clear to express our trust in the judicial system. A jury of one's peers is the hallmark of our country's judicial system. The American justice system is the finest in the world. George's fate is now in the hands of the jury, who will make their decision based on evidence and the facts of the case. <BR>As we await a verdict we will remain hopeful and ask for the public to remain peaceful, no matter the outcome. Though we maintain George committed no crime whatsoever, we acknowledge that the people who called for George's arrest and subsequent trial have now witnessed both events come to pass. We hope now that as Americans we will all respect the rule of law, which begins with respecting the verdict. The judicial system has run its course - pray for justice, pray for peace, pray for our country. <BR>Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's Family: We Want JusticeTrayvon's family also pleaded for justice as the trial ended. &quot;Justice, to me, would be for the person who killed our son to be held accountable and for all the evidence to come out and for, you know, a jury to hear everything that happened that night of February 26,&quot; Trayvon's mother, Sabrina Fulton said in a newly released interview with NBC. <BR>&quot;It is up to you to decide which evidence is reliable,&quot; Judge Debra Nelson told the six women sitting on the jury on July 12. The arguments are over, the evidence has been presented, the only thing left is for the jury to decide if George Zimmerman is guilty of second degree murder. <BR>&quot;You should use your common sense,&quot; Judge Nelson also instructed the jury. <BR>Considering the magnitude of this verdict, it could be some time before the jury comes to a unanimous decision - a waiting period that will likely be torturous for both Trayvon and George's families. The jury went on recess at 6 PM ET on July 12, but will reconvene on Saturday morning, July 13, and began deliberations once again.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The religious chairman for the county NAACP chapter urged the public to remain calm Friday as a jury in Florida decided the fate of a man charged in a racially-tinged homicide trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Larry Lee Thomas, pastor of the Empowering Believers Church in Glen Burnie, said the death of Trayvon Martin and homicide charges against George Zimmerman, have divided the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had an opportunity to see or view from both sides - the prosecution and the defense. We now know the decision is in the hands of the jury,&quot; Thomas said in a prepared statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said several organizations, the United Christian Clergy Alliance, North County Christian Clergy, Churches United Cluster, Clergy Advisory Board and other Ministries throughout Anne Arundel County and the county NAACP chapter, would work to prevent any outbreaks of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury adjourned Friday after hearing dueling portraits of Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain: a cop wannabe who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning volunteer who shot Martin in a Sanford, Fla., neighborhood because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas' call for quiet mirrored one in Sanford Friday where the case is being heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women - all but one of them white - will have to sort through a lot of conflicting testimony from police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors deliberated for three and a half hours when they decided to stop Friday evening. About two hours into their discussions, they asked for a list of the evidence. They were to resume deliberations Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses gave differing accounts of who was on top during the struggle, and Martin's parents and Zimmerman's parents both claimed that the voice heard screaming for help in the background of a 911 call was their son's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter. Under Florida's laws involving gun crimes, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second-degree murder: life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were big protests in Sanford and other cities across the country last year when authorities waited 44 days before arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen protesters, most of them from outside central Florida, gathered outside the courthouse as the jury deliberated. Martin supporters outnumbered those for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a family member in each of our churches so instead of dividing our family we as Pastors must keep them united. Let us have Resiliency and Calm and above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness,&quot; Thomas said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing still hanging in the air when the lawyers in the George Zimmerman trial finished their closing arguments was sadness -- heavy and thick, the choking kind, like acrid smoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some questions will never be answered. And some facts will never be altered -- chief among them, that there is a dead teenager with a hole in his heart sleeping in a Florida grave, a fact that never had to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman told Sean Hannity last year that his shooting of Trayvon Martin was ''God's plan'' and that if he could do it all over he would do nothing different. (Later in the interview, Zimmerman equivocated a bit on the topic without identifying what specifically he would change.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't pretend to know the heart of God or the details of his ''plans,'' but I hasten to hope that he -- or she -- would value life over death, that free will is part of a faithful walk, that our mistakes are not automatically postscripted as part of a divine destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would also hope that Zimmerman, having sat through his murder trial in the presence of the dead teen's grieving parents, might answer Hannity differently. Maybe the answer he gave last year was part of a legal defense. Maybe now he would have more empathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somewhere, behind the breastbone, where the conscience can speak freely without fear of legal implications or social condemnation, surely there can be an admission that, if he'd done some things differently -- like staying in his vehicle and not following the young man -- Martin would still be alive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the sadness lingers. Martin will never be free from the grave, and Zimmerman will never be free from his role in assigning Martin that fate. The two are forever linked, across life and death, across bad decisions and by opposite ends of a gun barrel. A life you take latches onto you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the rest of us, the questions are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens when the legal verdict is rendered and the social cause continues?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this case a springboard to high-level discussions about police procedures and the presumptions of guilt and innocence, or will it be a moment in which cultural constructs of biases and presumptions are calcified?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do we need a clean, binary narrative of good guys and bad guys to draw moral conclusions about right and wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should your past or what you wear or how you look subtract from your humanity and add to the suspicion you draw?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can we think of bias in the sophisticated way in which it operates -- not always conscious and not always constant, but rising and then falling like rancid water at the bottom of a sour well?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this, too, is why the sadness lingers. There is a mother who will never again see her son's impish smile or feel his warm body collapsing into her open arms. There is a father who won't be able to straighten his son's tie or tell him ''You missed a spot'' after a shave. There is a brother who will never be able to trade jokes and dreams and what-ifs with him well into the night, long after both should be asleep. The death of a child blasts a hole into the fabric of a family, one that can never truly be mended. I refuse to believe that was God's plan for Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sadness also lingers because so many parents and siblings and friends and sympathizers look on in horror at the prospect of a scary precedent -- that some may walk away from this trial believing that they should do nothing different from what Zimmerman did, and that the law may either endorse or allow inadvisable actions that could lead to such an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unarmed teenagers should not end up dead. I believe that most people would agree. This case, however, is about whether an unarmed teenager can engage an armed person -- one who admits to having pursued him -- in such a way that the teenager becomes responsible for his own death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury has to ponder and decide that. Only Zimmerman and Martin truly know the answer; one refused to testify, the other couldn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the verdict in this case is, it must be respected. The lawyers presented the cases they had, presumably to the best of their abilities, and the jurors will presumably do their best to be fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no one can ease the sadness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mahatma Gandhi once said: ''There is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience. It supersedes all other courts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that court, it is hard to avoid righteous conviction. Maybe that's part of God's plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ryan Coogler, the director of &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; answered emotional questions from the audience at Lincoln Center's Summer Talks series Thursday. Coogler, whose buzzed-about film is based on the real-life story of Oscar Grant, an unarmed 22-year-old black man who was fatally shot on an Oakland subway platform by a white cop, commented on the Trayvon Martin case, telling attendees, &quot;It affects you and depresses you and saddens you, because I think you know Trayvon had love in his life and potential.&quot; He continued, &quot;There are millions of Americans that don't see Trayvon's potential. They look at him and see him as a thug who got what he deserved. You know he was a 17-year-old boy that couldn't even vote yet, had never been arrested, never had a criminal record. My question is, why do people look at him and see that?&quot; Coogler concluded, &quot;We look at him and see something else. We look at him and see us.&quot; He said he hopes people will leave the movie asking the question, &quot;What is the value of human life?&quot;   </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With police and civic leaders urging calm, a jury began deliberating George Zimmerman&quot;s fate Friday after hearing duelling portraits of the neighbourhood watch captain: a cop wannabe who took the law into his own hands or a well-meaning volunteer who shot unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the jury got the murder case, police in this Orlando suburb went on national television to plead for peace in Sanford, in Florida and across America, no matter what the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no party in this case who wants to see any violence,&quot; Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said. &quot;We have an expectation upon this announcement that our community will continue to act peacefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During closing arguments, Zimmerman&quot;s lawyers put a concrete slab and two life-size cardboard cutouts in front of the jury box in one last attempt to convince the panel Zimmerman shot the unarmed black 17-year-old in self-defence while his head was being slammed against the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O&quot;Mara used the slab to make the point that it could serve as a weapon. He showed the cutouts of Zimmerman and Martin to demonstrate that the teenager was considerably taller. And he displayed a computer-animated depiction of the fight based on Zimmerman&quot;s account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said prosecutors hadn&quot;t met their burden of proving Zimmerman&quot;s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, he said, the case was built on &quot;could&quot;ve beens&quot; and &quot;maybes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn&quot;t been proven, it&quot;s just not there,&quot; O&quot;Mara said. &quot;You can&quot;t fill in the gaps. You can&quot;t connect the dots. You&quot;re not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rebuttal, prosecutor John Guy accused Zimmerman of telling &quot;so many lies.&quot; He said Martin&quot;s last emotion was fear as Zimmerman followed him through the gated townhouse community on the rainy night of Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn&quot;t that every child&quot;s worst nightmare, to be followed on the way home in the dark by a stranger?&quot; Guy said. &quot;Isn&quot;t that every child&quot;s worst fear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women all but one of them white will have to sort through a lot of conflicting testimony from police, neighbours, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors deliberated for three and a half hours when they decided to stop Friday evening. About two hours into their discussions, they asked for a list of the evidence. They will resume deliberations Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses gave differing accounts of who was on top during the struggle, and Martin&quot;s parents and Zimmerman&quot;s parents both claimed that the voice heard screaming for help in the background of an emergency call was their son&quot;s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter. Under Florida&quot;s laws involving gun crimes, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second-degree murder: life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge&quot;s decision to allow the jury to consider manslaughter was a potentially heavy blow to the defence: It could give jurors who aren&quot;t convinced the shooting amounted to murder a way to hold Zimmerman responsible for the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O&quot;Mara dismissed the prosecution&quot;s contention that Zimmerman was a &quot;crazy guy&quot; patrolling his townhouse complex and &quot;looking for people to harass&quot; when he saw Martin. O&quot;Mara also disputed prosecutors&quot; claim that Zimmerman snapped when he saw Martin because there had been a rash of break-ins in the neighbourhood, mostly by young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence attorney said Zimmerman at no point showed ill will, hatred or spite during his confrontation with Martin which is what prosecutors must prove for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That presumption isn&quot;t based on any fact whatsoever,&quot; O&quot;Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, prosecutors argued Zimmerman showed ill will when he whispered profanities to a police dispatcher over his cellphone while following Martin through the neighbourhood. They said Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; the teenager as a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy said Zimmerman violated the cornerstone of neighbourhood watch volunteer programs, which is to observe and report, not follow a suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s account of how he grabbed his gun from his holster at his waist as Martin straddled him is physically impossible, Guy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defendant didn&quot;t shoot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he had to; he shot him because he wanted to,&quot; Guy said. &quot;That&quot;s the bottom line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to invoke self-defence, Zimmerman only had to believe he was facing great bodily harm, his attorney said. He asked jurors not to let their sympathies for Martin&quot;s parents interfere with their decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a tragedy, truly,&quot; O&quot;Mara said. &quot;But you can&quot;t allow sympathy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the verdict drawing near, police and city leaders in Sanford and other parts of Florida said they have taken precautions for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if Zimmerman, whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic, is acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were big protests in Sanford and other cities across America last year when authorities waited 44 days before arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen protesters, most of them from outside central Florida, gathered outside the courthouse as the jury deliberated. Martin supporters outnumbered those for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) The jury in George Zimmerman&quot;s murder trial is set to begin a second day of deliberations on Saturday, weighing whether the neighborhood watch volunteer committed a crime almost a year and a half ago when he fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said prosecutors hadn&quot;t met their burden of proving Zimmerman&quot;s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, he said, the case was built on &quot;could&quot;ve beens&quot; and &quot;maybes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn&quot;t been proven, it&quot;s just not there,&quot; O&quot;Mara said. &quot;You can&quot;t fill in the gaps. You can&quot;t connect the dots. You&quot;re not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a rebuttal, prosecutor John Guy accused Zimmerman of telling &quot;so many lies.&quot; He said Martin&quot;s last emotion was fear as Zimmerman followed him through the gated townhouse community on the rainy night of Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn&quot;t that every child&quot;s worst nightmare, to be followed on the way home in the dark by a stranger?&quot; Guy said. &quot;Isn&quot;t that every child&quot;s worst fear?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One juror, a young woman, appeared to wipe away a tear as Guy said nothing would ever bring back Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequestered jury of six women all but one of them white will have to sort through a lot of conflicting testimony from police, neighbors, friends and family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors deliberated for three and a half hours when they decided to stop Friday evening. About two hours into their discussions, they asked for a list of the evidence. They will resume deliberations Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses gave differing accounts of who was on top during the struggle, and Martin&quot;s parents and Zimmerman&quot;s parents both claimed that the voice heard screaming for help in the background of a 911 call was their son&quot;s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter. Under Florida&quot;s laws involving gun crimes, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second-degree murder: life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge&quot;s decision to allow the jury to consider manslaughter was a potentially heavy blow to the defense: It could give jurors who aren&quot;t convinced the shooting amounted to murder a way to hold Zimmerman responsible for the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O&quot;Mara dismissed the prosecution&quot;s contention that Zimmerman was a &quot;crazy guy&quot; patrolling his townhouse complex and &quot;looking for people to harass&quot; when he saw Martin. O&quot;Mara also disputed prosecutors&quot; claim that Zimmerman snapped when he saw Martin because there had been a rash of break-ins in the neighborhood, mostly by young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense attorney said Zimmerman at no point showed ill will, hatred or spite during his confrontation with Martin which is what prosecutors must prove for second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That presumption isn&quot;t based on any fact whatsoever,&quot; O&quot;Mara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, prosecutors argued Zimmerman showed ill will when he whispered profanities to a police dispatcher over his cellphone while following Martin through the neighborhood. They said Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; the teenager as a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy said Zimmerman violated the cornerstone of neighborhood watch volunteer programs, which is to observe and report, not follow a suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s account of how he grabbed his gun from his holster at his waist as Martin straddled him is physically impossible, Guy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defendant didn&quot;t shoot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he had to; he shot him because he wanted to,&quot; Guy said. &quot;That&quot;s the bottom line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to invoke self-defense, Zimmerman only had to believe he was facing great bodily harm, his attorney said. He asked jurors not to let their sympathies for Martin&quot;s parents interfere with their decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a tragedy, truly,&quot; O&quot;Mara said. &quot;But you can&quot;t allow sympathy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the verdict drawing near, police and city leaders in Sanford and other parts of Florida said they have taken precautions for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if Zimmerman, whose father is white and whose mother is Hispanic, is acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were big protests in Sanford and other cities across the country last year when authorities waited 44 days before arresting Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a dozen protesters, most of them from outside central Florida, gathered outside the courthouse as the jury deliberated. Martin supporters outnumbered those for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD - Outside the courthouse here on Saturday morning, Daytona Beach pastor Monzell Ford thought he'd get everyone to stop for a second and pray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo Galleries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* George Zimmerman Verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't finish his prayer amid a crowd of protesters and TV cameras before the shouting took over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of hate right now. Frustration right now. There's a lot of pain right now,&quot; Ford said Saturday morning in Sanford, hours before a jury acquitted George Zimmerman of second-degree murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Confusion on both sides. We have people crying out, 'Justice!' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice for George!&quot; a man's voice yelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford kept on. &quot;...This is a time that we can unite right now, to come together, for one reason and one reason only. One reason, and what's that?&quot; (Prayer, he hoped they'd say.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice for Trayvon!&quot; a woman's voice yelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice for George Zimmerman!&quot; the man yelled back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A chant started, then got louder. &quot;What do we want? Justice! For who? Trayvon!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford tried again to pray for peace. But another voice in the crowd was already telling the Zimmerman supporter: &quot;Go back to the hole you crawled out of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That scene opened the second day of waiting for a Zimmerman verdict outside the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center in Sanford, where heated arguments -- on race, on the justice system, on gun rights and other often-divisive issues - escalated as opposing sides mixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seminole County sheriff's deputies, posted around the perimeter of a &quot;free speech zone&quot; in the courtyard, separated two people arguing in the afternoon. No punches were thrown and no one was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The courtyard, split down the middle by temporary metal fencing, divided Zimmerman supporters and the demonstrators demanding his murder conviction. But the sides mixed freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell walked by. Later, Geraldo Rivera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone was fighting, and occasional harmonica and banjo playing filtered through some of the noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Trayvon&nbsp;Martin demonstrator crossed the divide and yelled to his friends, &quot;Take my picture with the Zimmerman people!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Casey David Kole Sr., the man yelling &quot;Justice for George!&quot; during Ford's prayer, eventually took a photo with a woman on the Trayvon side and jokingly asked if she was married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man, 51-year-old David Turner of Sanford, painted himself half black and stood between the sides: &quot;I'm neutral,&quot; he said. &quot;That's why I'm standing here in the middle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young man who identified himself only as Malcolm X was roaming the courtyard challenging others to debate: &quot;Zimmerman's whole story relies on the fact that the young black male is a criminal,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the crowds chanted &quot;Justice for Trayvon,&quot; Malcolm X shouted back: &quot;Justice for the black man in America, not just Trayvon! It's going to happen again even if he does get justice!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chants evolved. One became: &quot;It's neighborhood watch, not neighborhood kill!&quot; Then: &quot;Trayvon didn't have to die; we all know the reason why!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman supporters held signs: &quot;We Love You George.&quot; &quot;Not Guilty.&quot; &quot;George Got Hit, You Must Acquit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of young people who arrived shortly after 9:30 a.m. and demonstrated all day promised protests around the country if the jury returned anything other than a guilty verdict for second- degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pastor Ford, who said he was in Los Angeles during rioting after the 1992 acquittal of several police officers charged with beating Rodney King, hoped those protests would be peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to see that again,&quot; he said. &quot;Not here, not in Miami, not in L.A.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're trying to keep it peaceful. It's not about race,&quot; said William Memola, 52, of Orlando. &quot;If he's not guilty, there's going to be no peace. Listen to them. They're chanting, 'No justice, no peace!' That's a threat ... Down south, it's never going to change. I don't know why.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tempers flared among protesters outside the Sanford courthouse Friday as six jurors deliberated George Zimmerman's fate, and tensions worsened after the jury left for the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of protesters, some wearing New Black Panthers uniforms, and a handful of Zimmerman supporters faced off over metal barricades in a designated &quot;free speech zone&quot; as sheriff's deputies looked on, at times urging the most impassioned debaters to lower their voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scene stood in contrast to the how Seminole County Sheriff Don Elsinger just a few hours earlier gauged the sentiment in his community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Teasley, who said he owns a unit in the gated community where Zimmerman said he shot and killed Trayvon Martin in self-defense more than a year ago, held several neon-green signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One read, &quot;Free George Now 4 Justice.&quot; Another declared &quot;Creepy ass cracker is racist,&quot; referring to how Martin allegedly described Zimmerman on the telephone to a friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teasley, joined by his wife and a few other people, said he believed other whites were too intimidated to show support for Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my opinion, using the words 'creepy ass cracker' to describe a white person is racist,&quot; Teasley said, eliciting heated responses from blacks on the other side of the fence who burst into an impromptu, &quot;We're not racist&quot; chant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his sign, Teasley insisted the trial wasn't an issue of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an issue of the law of self-defense,&quot; he told reporters, who at times outnumbered protesters on the courthouse lawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for many blacks, including members of the Uhuru Movement, the Black People's Advancement and Defense Organization and others, outside the courthouse, there was no gray area. The Zimmerman case for them was a matter of black and white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case represents &quot;the value of black life in this country,&quot; said Life Malcolm, a member of the Black People's Advancement and Defense Organization of Tampa. &quot;If George Zimmerman walks, it says it's open season on black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Chimurenga Waller, the national director of the African People's Socialist Party of St. Petersburg, the trial symbolized &quot;our relationship to the U.S. government over a 400-year period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black people will never get justice. It's not going to happen,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emotional exchanges between the two sides ranged from whether Zimmerman, whose mother is Hispanic, is a minority, to the use of the word &quot;cracker,&quot; to whether Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, should have remained in his car as instructed by 911 operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teasley's sign outraged Shameca Byrd, whose friends repeatedly tried, but failed, to pull her away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm telling you right now. Zimmerman is guilty,&quot; she said. &quot;The reason why he's guilty is because it's not about stand your ground. It's about staying in your car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, about 30 minutes after the jury was released to deliberate, Eslinger insisted that fears of a violent outbreak in the case of an acquittal were unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no tension in Seminole County,&quot; Eslinger, joined by Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith, said after the 15 days of testimony wrapped up Friday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith was more circumspect. He acknowledged that 15 months of intensive outreach to the black community helped defuse initial anger over the police department's failure to arrest Zimmerman immediately after he killed the unarmed black 17-year-old on Feb. 26 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing and lack of an arrest sparked protests in Sanford and across the country and prompted Gov. Rick Scott to appoint a special prosecutor. Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder six weeks after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the police chief said more needs to be done to address the underlying anger stirred by the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to sit here and tell you everything is peachy-keen in the city of Sanford,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments after the officials ended their press conference, tempers erupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters, most of them black, and a single white man wearing a &quot;Happy Cracker&quot; T-shirt, engaged in a fervent exchange as the media, vastly outnumbering the participants, rolled cameras at ground level and from helicopters overhead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; chanted the protesters, comprised of a handful of men wearing New Black Panthers uniforms; others carrying signs, including one which read, &quot;If you're white and want to get away with murder come to Fla&quot;; and a white couple holding a sign saying Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law needs to be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some residents are not confident that cooler heads will prevail in the event of an acquittal. Some expressed their concerns to Smith during one of his regular &quot;walk and talks&quot; Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holly Manners, 24, lives in the mostly black Goldsboro district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to be here when that happens. I already have plans to leave,&quot; said Manners, who is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miriam Holmes, a mother of three who is black, predicted riots &quot;all over the world&quot; in the event of an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Zimmerman walks, it's going to be hell,&quot; Holmes said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Department of Justice Community Relations Service regional director Tommy Battles, who has been a constant presence in Sanford since the shooting, participated in meetings with the law enforcement chiefs, members of the clergy and the NAACP on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Pastors Connect, a coalition of clergy from white and black churches in the area, held one of their regular meetings at the sheriff's headquarters across the street from the courthouse Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our plans are to make sure we promote peace, harmony and goodwill,&quot; First Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church pastor H.D. Rucker said after the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief also was visited by NAACP president Benjamin Jealous and state and local NAACP leaders Friday. The NAACP's national convention in nearby Orlando begins today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precautions also were being taken elsewhere in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Florida, Miami-Dade County's Community Relations Board, formed to ease tensions after the 1980 riots, said in an email Friday that Department of Homeland Security units had been deployed to various locations throughout the county although no threats, criminal activity or demonstrations related to the Zimmerman trial had been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CRB membership is actively working to promote intergroup harmony and civility,&quot; the email read.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD   The Florida jury deciding the fate of George Zimmerman for killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin asked for clarification on Saturday on manslaughter, the less-serious charge he faces in the case that has sparked debate on race and guns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel of six women, which has deliberated more than 12 hours over two days, could decide on manslaughter, second-degree murder or acquittal for Zimmerman, who says he shot the 17-year-old Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, said Martin attacked him on the night of Feb. 26, 2012, in the central Florida town of Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors contend Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch coordinator in his gated community, was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who tracked down the teenager and shot him without justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, which carries the possibility of a life prison sentence, the jury must find Zimmerman acted with ill will, spite or hatred. The option of manslaughter, which has a lesser burden of culpable negligence, carries a prison sentence of up to 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors, who are sequestered, heard 12 days of testimony and two days of closing arguments before deliberating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although small compared with the protests that erupted after the killing last year, about 100 demonstrators braved the blistering Florida sun to gather outside the Seminole County courthouse as the deliberations proceeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a handful, including one brandishing a sign that read, &quot;George You Got Hit, You Must Acquit,&quot; appeared to support Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrying placards reading: &quot;Jail the Killer&quot; and &quot;Justice 4 Trayvon,&quot; many called for a murder conviction. Some wore T-shirts with an image of Zimmerman in the crosshairs of a gun, with the words &quot;Yes Sir ... Creepy Ass Cracker&quot; on the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Creepy ass cracker&quot; were the words Martin's friend Rachael Jeantel told the court he used to describe Zimmerman on a cell phone call moments before he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the courthouse, Judge Debra Nelson said she would allow the jurors to set their own working hours. The panel worked through lunch on Saturday, returning only at about 6 p.m. (2200 GMT) to ask for the clarification on the manslaughter charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The saga began on the rainy February night when Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious person in his neighborhood. That was Martin, visiting the home of his father's fiancee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fight that ensued, Zimmerman suffered several head injuries and he shot Martin once through the heart with a Kel Tec 9 mm pistol loaded with hollow-point bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman, believing his account of self-defense. That provoked demonstrations, which spread nationwide, accusing Zimmerman of racial profiling and demanding his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was arrested 45 days after the shooting, after the Sanford police chief stepped down and the governor appointed a special prosecutor who pressed second-degree murder charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARASOTA: Region abuzz with talk of evidence and legalities, history and race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SARASOTA - It was the boring part. The anger was at a low hum beneath the blast of the TV, playing at the volume's tinny threshold in this Sarasota barbershop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury rules blasted before the start of deliberations Friday in the murder trial of George Zimmerman, a courtroom drama that has captivated the nation, this state, this town, this shop in Newtown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brawny men with tattoos cut hair and argued, pointing their combs, above the noise and over the crowd of neighbors who came to watch. They joked about stealing Skittles and wearing hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teithis Miller, a black 15-year-old with silver braces and a soft voice, kept to himself among them, waiting patiently for a haircut at Phatheadz Barbershop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kind of feel how it is,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I live in a neighborhood with a lot of white people, and they sometimes look at us like, 'What are you doing here?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller lives in the Indian Beach neighborhood and is about to begin his freshman year at Booker High. To honor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year-old who was shot and killed by Zimmerman, the teenager has blacked out his profile picture on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury could convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder or manslaughter in Martin's death or could acquit the defendant, who is claiming self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In defiant tones that ran counter to his reserved demeanor, Miller said he thought Zimmerman would be better served by a conviction. Because &quot;if he gets out, I think somebody is going to get him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a static but palpable anger in Sarasota's black community. The city's white leaders know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Chief Bernadette DiPino has tried to pre-empt any potential for violence with calls for peaceful protest in the event of a Zimmerman acquittal. She stood near a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. in north Sarasota on Thursday and lit a candle for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other jurisdictions, including Bradenton, have taken precautions in lockstep with community and church leaders and are preparing for unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, it has become an American experience to expect outrcry in cases that draw such deep divisions along racial lines. So we wait, for the verdict and the tension to boil over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those tensions are especially weighty in communities where acrimony between police and minorities has been percolating for many years, as it has in Sarasota and other cities in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the level of animosity is high already, then there is more concern,&quot; said Ojmarrh Mitchell, an associate professor at the University of South Florida and an expert on race and crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell said he believes the Zimmerman case has gripped this country because of who Martin was - a normal kid who was unjustly profiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think with many young black people that resonates,&quot; he said. &quot;They've aroused suspicion, but haven't done anything wrong. Except in this case Trayvon is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mitchell has noticed something else about this case:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to a barbershop twice this week, once for me and once for my son, and both times it was on,&quot; he said. &quot;You know these are two different barbershops, and there was wall-to-wall coverage. I've never seen anything like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A different take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Krempel has feverishly followed the case since the night Martin was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krempel called her son, who owns Michael Urban Hair Studio, Friday morning to make sure he would have the trial playing when she came in for a 3 p.m. appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish I could be on the jury,&quot; Krempel said. &quot;I just think he's guilty. He didn't have to kill that young man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Krempel was able to stream CNN on his computer, but the jury had gone into deliberations prior to his mother's arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disappointed, Krempel just talked about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be riots if he's found innocent,&quot; Krempel said. &quot;If there are riots, somebody else will be hurt or killed, and it won't do any good. It won't change the verdict. George Zimmerman will have to be protected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of what the jury decides, Palmetto City Commissioner Charles Smith said the nation - and especially Florida - will feel the impact of this case long after it leaves the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict that comes out may be the biggest verdict in the history of Florida,&quot; he said. &quot;Racial profiling, gun rights, freedom of speech - all of that is tied to the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;State laws will change. Gun laws will change. Security will be addressed. It will reshape the state of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farther south, the Lanoue family discussed the case over a late lunch at Chili's on South Tamiami Trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know enough to have a real opinion,&quot; said Steve Lanoue. &quot;I don't know the details of all sides, and I never will because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlene Lanoue said the family somehow ends up at the same restaurant during highly publicized trials: Casey Anthony, Jodi Arias. And now, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could go either way,&quot; said Charlene, who has explained to their children that even though someone was killed, Zimmerman could be innocent by way of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlene said the African-American community has been very involved in publicizing the case, and she wonders how circumstances might have been different if the dead young man hadn't been black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will violence follow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolyn Mason, a Sarasota county commissioner and longtime activist for the black community, was turned off by the police chief's message to the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the intention I think was good,&quot; Mason said, &quot;I think it was paternalistic. I think it was, in a way. I was a bit offended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mason is among a few leaders in North Sarasota who respond to crime scenes to coordinate community response and try to quell any possible anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 2012, Mason responded when Sarasota County deputies shot and killed Rodney Mitchell, a 23-year-old black man who had been pulled over for an alleged seatbelt violation. Mitchell tried to flee the scene, nearly hitting a deputy, the Sheriff's Office said. He was also unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to get the facts and get them to an angry group of onlookers, who were already spreading the word, Mason discovered at the scene that it was Mitchell - her nephew - who had been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence was not an appropriate response, she urged. But after the shooting was ruled justified, and as the family continues a lawsuit against the county, she is still reminding people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a striking similarity in the basics of both cases,&quot; she said. &quot;I think the community is putting it together like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Kelvin Lumpkin, also a leader in the black community, said he agrees that people are conflating the Zimmerman trial with lingering pain from Mitchell's shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he says the city's police chief made the right call in urging peace before the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what the chief did was good,&quot; Lumpkin said. &quot;Rodney Mitchell got killed last year, and there's still some open wounds there. There's still some lingering sense of injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> POLICE and community leaders in several Florida cities were last night preparing for the prospect of civil unrest as a jury was sent out to consider its verdict in the murder trial of a neighbourhood watch leader who shot dead an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers in Miami practiced riot drills with horses and batons ahead of the decision in the trial of George Zimmerman, who claims he acted in self-defence when he shot Trayvon Martin, 17, at his housing development in Sanford in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers in the case delivered closing remarks yesterday morning and a verdict could come as early as today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami, Mr Martin's home town, has a history of racial unrest and saw the deaths of 18 people in 1980 following the acquittal of four white police officers accused of beating a black motorist to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are preparing for the worst but hoping for the best,&quot; said Dr Walter Richardson, chairman of the Miami-Dade community relations board that held a public meeting earlier this week to educate and update citizens about the progress of the three-week trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a Miami police spokesman insisted the timing of the riot practice was a coincidence, another source said the department's intelligence team had been scouring social media sites for &quot;unusual interest&quot; in the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, the central Florida town where about a quarter of the 53,000 population is black, police chief Cecil Smith confirmed he had talked with officials of the federal departments of justice and homeland security but stressed there was &quot;nothing out there&quot; to suggest there would be any violent or widespread public reaction to an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a longstanding plan of &quot;precautionary measures,&quot; a team of local pastors has worked shifts sitting in the courtroom to keep residents informed and try to quell any anger that might follow Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church elders have pointed out that civil rights protests attracting tens of thousands passed off peacefully last spring when Zimmerman was initially released without charge and not arrested for 44 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Scott Israel, the sheriff of Broward County further to the south, aired a &quot;raise your voices, not your hands&quot; advert on television this week as part of a wider response plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just want to be prepared,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, wrapped up the defence case by urging the all-female jury of six not to rely on &quot;could have beens&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot; as they determine his guilt or innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What aren't words of good prosecutors are maybe, what if, I hope so, you figure it out, could have been,&quot; Mr O'Mara said, referring to Thursday's closing arguments by state attorney Bernie de la Rionda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prove second-degree murder, the state must show that Zimmerman acted with spite, hatred or ill-will when he shot Mr Martin. The defendant faces at least 25 years in jail if convicted, or up to 30 if the jury finds him guilty of  manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who pleaded not guilty on the grounds of self-defence, insists Mr Martin began the confrontation with a &quot;sucker punch&quot; that broke his nose and then smashed his head on a concrete pavement, leaving him no option but to fire his pistol to save his life. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman verdict has many edgy, they say</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A group of black Hillsborough County elected officials pleaded with their constituents Friday to maintain calm no matter what verdict is decided in George Zimmerman's trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was visiting his father in a gated community in Sanford. Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, says he shot Martin in self-defense because the teenager was beating him and he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial's racial overtones have made it a sensation far beyond Sanford, a small community near Orlando where the trial is being held. Judge Debra Nelson gave the jury final instructions Friday afternoon before they began deliberations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Hillsborough County, where the trial is being followed closely in African-American neighborhoods, black leaders are worried about the prospect for unrest, even riots, should Zimmerman be found not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of what happens, if the verdict comes back in any way that a segment of this community feels that it should not have gone that way ... we ask for calm and peace, Hillsborough County Commissioner Les Miller said at the afternoon news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No violence, no turmoil, no destroying property in the community, Miller added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other black officials attending the conference shared much the same message. State Rep. Betty Reed, a Tampa Democrat, pointed out that Martin's family had also urged black Americans to be peaceful, whatever the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should respect their wishes, Reed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said they felt compelled to hold the news conference because constituents in their districts are also worried about the potential for violence, especially among restive youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a long, hot summer and our young people are out of school, said county school board member Dorothea Edgecomb, and sometimes having nothing to do can make them stray to doing things that are unacceptable or maybe spontaneous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller said the racial overtones of the Zimmerman-Martin case could create an atmosphere similar to 1967 when black neighborhoods were torn by riots after a white police officer shot an unarmed black man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited what he called some of the ugliest comments he has seen in readers' reactions posted on a story at the Tribune's TBO.com  website about potential unrest among blacks if Zimmerman is cleared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You would think after 1967 we wouldn't be in this position, but we are, Miller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tribune story cited reports that Gov. Rick Scott had been in contact with law enforcement agencies across the state asking them to be prepared for whatever happens.  Police in Sarasota, Sanford and South Florida have appealed for calm through news conferences and social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Councilman Frank Reddick said his office had shared the officials' concerns with Tampa Police Chief Jane Castor, who is out of town. Castor was aware the officials planned to have a news conference to address the matter, Reddick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is trying to get back in town this moment because a verdict can be rendered anytime this weekend, Reddick said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than riots, the officials said they hoped the Zimmerman trial will be used as a learning experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an opportunity for this community to come together as a people, Miller said, regardless of race, creed, color, national origin, religion or sexual orientation, to start discussions so we can make sure these types of incidents don't happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edgecomb added that her hope and prayer is that the verdict will demonstrate justice, equality, objectivity and fairness at their best.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Six women consider conflicting stories of Trayvon Martin's killing.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman shot a 17-year-old through the heart on a rainy night in February 2012. Now, finally, nearly 17 months later, a jury will try to decide whether the dead boy deserved it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman contends he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyers have methodically cast doubt on the state's case against Zimmerman. They have suggested the state has not proved that the professed Christian, husband and neighborhood watchman acted with ill will or hatred when he followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin into the darkness between two sets of townhouses in the gated community called the Retreat at Twin Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have argued it was Martin who instigated the altercation by sucker-punching Zimmerman, 29, in the nose, bashed his head against a sidewalk and reached for the fully loaded handgun which Zimmerman was licensed to carry. They showed jurors an animated video which portrayed Martin as the aggressor and Zimmerman as a pathetic victim whose only means of salvation was holstered at his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six women on the jury, whether they know it or not, will be the focus of intense attention. The case has sparked debates across the nation about racism, ageism, gun control, and Florida's controversial 2005 expansion of self-defense law, known as &quot;stand your ground.&quot; Their verdict will echo through America, affirming beliefs for some, creating distrust for others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a serious, serious matter for Mr. Zimmerman,&quot; defense lawyer Mark O'Mara told them in his closing argument. &quot;And it's a serious matter for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara told the jury the state based its case on conjecture, not the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many coulda-beens have you heard from the state in this case?&quot; he asked. &quot;How many what-ifs have you heard from the state in this case?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the state wanted jurors to believe Zimmerman was a &quot;crazy,&quot; aggressive, well-trained neighborhood watch captain who hunted down an innocent teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not true, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was a caring man who had seen his neighbors victimized by a rash of burglaries, O'Mara said, many of them by young black men. It was not illegal for Zimmerman to follow Martin, he said, but prudent. He said Zimmerman voluntarily submitted to law enforcement interrogations without a lawyer after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If George Zimmerman intended to deceive,&quot; he said, &quot;why would he have given six statements?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara cautioned the jurors not to guess at what they thought happened in the darkness between those buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Though you can bring your common sense, don't bring your assumptions, don't bring your presumptions,&quot; he said. &quot;You only get to decide on what you're certain of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the inconsistencies in Zimmerman's statements to police and Fox News, he said: &quot;You get your nose smashed and your head smashed and you answer every question they ask of you. Yeah, okay, deal with the inconsistencies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only moments of drama during O'Mara's three-hour closing argument came when he dragged props before the jury. He presented two cardboard cutouts of Zimmerman and Martin, which showed the difference in height, but not weight and age. He also hauled a large chunk of concrete and placed it before the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a sidewalk,&quot; he said after smacking the hard chunk. &quot;And that's not an unarmed teenager with nothing but Skittles, trying to get home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, he showed jurors an enlarged photograph of a shirtless Martin to show the boy's muscle tone. He pointed out that the autopsy photos jurors had seen during trial lacked the same tone, presumably because of blood loss, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While O'Mara's remarks were measured and short on emotion, Assistant State Attorney John Guy, in his rebuttal, sounded like a preacher at a Southern Baptist revival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Isn't that every child's worst nightmare, to be followed on the way home in the dark by a stranger?&quot; Guy asked the jurors. &quot;Isn't that every child's worst fear? That was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's last emotion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guy challenged Zimmerman's claim of self-defense, hammering on the fact that Zimmerman left his vehicle and disregarded the police dispatcher's admonishment not to follow. Would Martin still be wearing his ear buds and talking on the cell phone had he been poised for attack? he asked. Could Martin have even seen Zimmerman's holstered gun in the dark?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are only two people on this earth who know what really happened,&quot; Guy says. &quot;One of them can't testify, and the other one lied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents sat still in the courtroom. Zimmerman watched Guy, betraying no emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rain cloud burst as the defense finished its rebuttal and an afternoon downpour cut the Florida heat. A woman and two children who had been holding placards, the only noticeable protests, hustled away from the courthouse for shelter. But a few hours later, more protesters began to gather, some representing the New Black Panther Party. A man shouted through a bullhorn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officials in Sanford and Seminole County say they're prepared for civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At times, as individuals, we may not agree with this verdict, but as communities in this country, we respect the rule of law,&quot; said Seminole County Sheriff Donald Eslinger. &quot;We recognize that this case has stirred up a great deal of emotion, but there's no tension in Seminole County. ... We will not tolerate anyone who uses this verdict as an excuse to violate the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police Chief Cecil Smith said the city has changed since some 30,000 protesters showed up a few months after the shooting, demanding that Zimmerman be arrested. The Police Department has reviewed practices, held community meetings and done training on bias-based policing and ethics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we await this verdict, we'd like to remind everyone that the city of Sanford has been a peaceful location since that time 17 months ago,&quot; he said. &quot;We've learned some lessons through this past 15 months. ... More needs to be done. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that everything is peachy keen in Sanford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he said, &quot;Our community is working together to be the example, to talk about things, to put things on the table. It's our community, and when this trial passes, it will still be our community. When the light is no longer shining on Sanford, it will still be our community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury is charged with deciding if George Zimmerman is guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter, or if the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was excusable or resulted from justifiable use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prove second-degree murder, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the death was caused by the criminal actions of Zimmerman and that the unlawful killing of Martin by an act imminently dangerous to another and demonstrating a depraved mind without regard for human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prove manslaughter, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman intentionally committed an act or acts that caused the death of Martin. Zimmerman can't be guilty of manslaughter by committing a merely negligent act or if the killing was justifiable or excusable. The killing is justifiable homicide and lawful if necessarily done while resisting an attempt to murder or commit a felony upon Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six women retreated to the jury room Friday to choose a forewoman and begin their work. About two hours into their discussions, they asked for a list of the evidence. At 6 p.m., after 4 1/2 hours of deliberating, the jury asked the judge to break for the night. They'll start deliberations at 9 a.m. today and may work through the weekend if they choose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida authorities were bracing themselves for disturbances as the trial of a Neighbourhood Watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager drew towards its conclusion yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's lawyer implored the all-female jury to acquit his client, assuring them that he had acted in self defence when he killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. &quot;You want to take away somebody's liberty? They've got to prove their case. The burden is on the state,&quot; said Mr Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution has characterised Mr Zimmerman, 29, as an overzealous vigilante who was &quot;guilty of making assumptions&quot; about Trayvon, 17, based on his looks. If Mr Zimmerman felt suspicious enough to follow him, he could have challenged him verbally, but he did not. &quot;Why? Because he's got a gun, he has the equaliser, he's gonna take care of it, he's a wannabe cop,&quot; said the lead prosecutor, Bernie de la Rionda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has become a flashpoint for America's civil rights movement after the Sanford Police Department refused to arrest or charge Mr Zimmerman, accepting his claim that he had shot him in self defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 26, 2012, Trayvon was walking to his father's house after a trip to a local shop to buy Skittles and a drink but he was followed by Mr Zimmerman, resulting in a fatal fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after Rick Scott, the Governor of Florida, appointed a special prosecutor, amid a national outcry and comments from President Obama that the nation needed to treat the case &quot;with the seriousness it deserves&quot; and that &quot;if I had a son he would look like Trayvon&quot;, was it decided that the case should be judged by a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, no evidence emerged that Mr Zimmerman, who is of mixed white and Hispanic heritage, was driven by racism and the state has struggled to prove that he killed out of ill will, hatred or spite - criteria required for a second-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr O'Mara said the notion that Mr Martin was an &quot;unarmed teenager with nothing but Skittles&quot; was wrong. Trayvon used the concrete sidewalk as a weapon on which to pound Mr Zimmerman's head and his fists to punch him, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Miami, where Trayvon lived with his mother, have in recent days been practising riot control techniques but claim that it was just a routine exercise. Officers pointed out, however, that it is the first time in two years that there has been such an exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors took notes as they were played a brief animation depicting what Mr Zimmerman says happened that night and what certain witnesses said they saw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video showed a hooded figure, Trayvon, straddling Mr Zimmerman on the ground but then, after the fatal shot, Mr Zimmerman straddling Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman was seen on top by one resident who gave evidence for the prosecution but that scenario occurred after the shooting, said Mr O'Mara, as the gunman clambered out from underneath the body. &quot;What you have to do is be absolutely vigilant, diligent, in looking at this case,&quot; Mr O'Mara told the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, a charge that carries a life sentence. Jurors will also consider an alternative charge of manslaughter, which carries a sentence of up to 30 years, when they are handed the case this afternoon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The compulsively parsed, gargantuanly viewed, passionately felt trial that spooled out for three weeks in Courtroom 5D here answered a question of guilt or innocence with a question: Will we ever know exactly what happened that night in the Retreat at Twin Lakes? Neither the defense nor the prosecution pretended to know for sure. In this era of omnipresent cameras, neither could show a video of the crime; neither could produce a witness who saw all and told all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they revealed over days of often-scintillating testimony and in vigorous closing arguments Thursday and Friday was a mosaic. All of those fragments got glued together, just enough - they hoped - to sway the jury of six women who began deliberating Friday on the second-degree murder and manslaughter charges against George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Mark O'Mara has called it the &quot;bizarro trial,&quot; an upside-down affair. And it launched bizarrely, with a dud of a joke told by another defense attorney, Don West: &quot;Knock, knock. Who's there? George Zimmerman. George Zimmerman who? Good, you're on the jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecution witnesses, at times, seemed like defense witnesses. Defense witnesses, at times, seemed like prosecution witnesses. The prosecution offered Chris Serino, a gruff, gravel-voiced Sanford police officer with a buzz cut, but he ended up telling jurors that he believed Zimmerman's self-defense version of the shooting. The defense called Martin's father, Tracy Martin, who ended up rebutting the testimony of Serino and another police investigator who said he told them that the voice crying for help in the background of a 911 call was not his son's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who started this?&quot; prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda asked jurors. &quot;Who followed whom?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda, in a style that sometimes seemed more reminiscent of a defense attorney sowing doubt than a prosecutor emboldened by an air of certainty, peppered jurors with questions. &quot;How does he get the gun out?&quot; de la Rionda asked after demonstrating how Zimmerman would have had difficulty reaching behind his back for his holstered gun if Martin was on top of him. &quot;How did the victim see that in the darkness?&quot; the prosecutor asked about the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda's questions gave an opening to O'Mara. &quot;They're supposed to use words like certainty, definite, beyond a reasonable doubt, no other explanation,&quot; O'Mara told jurors Friday. &quot;What aren't good words? Maybe, what if, I hope so, you figure it out, could've been.&quot; Don't &quot;connect dots,&quot; he urged jurors, don't &quot;fill in blanks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor John Guy, a square-jawed assistant state attorney whom some commentators have nicknamed &quot;McDreamy,&quot; attempted to mute O'Mara's attack. But he threw out questions, too, repeating, &quot;Why did he lie?&quot; in reference to inconsistencies in Zimmerman's account. Paramount among those were Zimmerman's claim that he spread Martin's arms - the teen was found with his hands under his body - and the neighborhood watch volunteer's statement in a Fox News interview that he did not know about Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which gives extensive latitude to citizens who feel threatened. Professors testified that Zimmerman had studied the law. (Even though questions were asked about the law, Zimmerman's attorneys are not mounting a stand-your-ground defense.) Guy mocked the defense's suggestion that Zimmerman was not physically fit enough to subdue Martin, calling Zimmerman the &quot;Stay Puft Man,&quot; a reference to a character in the movie &quot;Ghostbusters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution relied heavily on a brash and sassy 19-year-old Miami high schooler namedRachel Jeantel, who had lied about her age and falsely claimed to have skipped Martin's memorial service because she was in the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like much in the trial, her testimony became a cultural touchstone outside the courtroom and a source of dispute inside it. She said that she was on a cellphone with Martin in the moments before he died and that he said a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; was following him, supporting the prosecution's portrayal of Zimmerman as the aggressor. Might she have neglected to &quot;code switch,&quot; some commentators mused, referring to the difficulty of translating the vernacular of African American youth into a courtroom setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors, by the time they began deliberating Friday afternoon, had heard the tape of Zimmerman's call to a non-emergency police number on the night of Feb. 26, 2012, over and over. Attorneys pounded the bare outlines of that night into their minds: Zimmerman got out of his Honda Ridgeline, he muttered under his breath about &quot;f---ing punks&quot; and &quot;a--holes&quot; that &quot;always get away.&quot; What they were left to sort out is Zimmerman's claim in police interviews that he was afraid of the figure in the &quot;hoodie&quot; sweatshirt, and de la Rionda's skeptical question: &quot;If he's really in fear, why does he get out of the car?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors, who had requested a list of all exhibits, recessed Friday evening after deliberating for more than three hours and will resume their work Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The run-up to the trial was steeped in unease about race relations in America, with rage among many civil rights leaders about the initial decision of Sanford police not to charge Zimmerman, who has a white father and a Hispanic mother. And although race was not the focal point of the trial, both sides felt compelled to touch upon it during their closing arguments. O'Mara nudged jurors to consider that - even though the suspects in previous burglaries in Zimmerman's neighborhood had been young black males - the defendant never said anything like &quot;I hate these young black males&quot; in calls to police. And Guy, the assistant state attorney, insisted that this case &quot;is not about race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long expanse of grass outside the Seminole County Courthouse has been all but empty throughout the trial, the crowds that massed in this city north of Orlando to demand an arrest absent now that the case was being tried. But on Friday, a new sight appeared: dozens of demonstrators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metro Atlanta law enforcement officials say they're prepared for --- but not expecting --- any public protests when a verdict comes down in the George Zimmerman case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlos Campos, spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department, said Thursday that department commanders have met to discuss a contingency plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Campos said, officials &quot;will not discuss specific preparations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Atlanta Police Department is prepared to respond to any crises that may arise as a result of such demonstrations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is on trial in Sanford, Fla., on a second-degree murder charge in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a young African-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the trial is in another state, the Rodney King case in 1992 showed that reaction to a verdict can spread far and wide. Riots broke out in several cities --- including Atlanta --- after three Los Angeles police officers were acquitted of beating King, an African-American construction worker, following a high-speed car chase. A portion of a video tape of officers repeatedly striking King had been shown around the world, inflaming public outrage and racial tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors in the Zimmerman case made closing arguments to the jury Thursday afternoon, arguing that Zimmerman profiled Martin as a criminal and followed the teen through the townhouse complex where Zimmerman lived and Martin was visiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has claimed self-defense and pleaded not guilty to the charges in the polarizing case. His lawyers make their closing arguments Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gwinnett County Police spokesman Edwin Ritter said Thursday that officials with his department &quot;will tell officers at roll call to be vigilant.&quot; But he said, right now, they don't see any reason for concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't received any intel that anything is going to be happening out here,&quot; Ritter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A private company that provides guest management and security for the World Congress Center made robo calls Thursday to part-time workers, looking for people willing to report should the Congress Center and Georgia Dome require additional security after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The robo call said &quot;timid&quot; people aren't needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennifer LeMaster, Congress Center spokeswoman, said the calls were made &quot;out of an abundance of caution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't anticipate or expect anything. But since this case has caught the attention of the media and has great sensitivity, we felt it was in the best interest of everyone that we do, as we regularly do, and review our security and make sure we have the right people in place,&quot; she said. &quot;If you are in our position, you don't want to be unprepared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The King case perhaps gives reason for a cautious stance. Although the officers' trial in the King case was 2,000 miles away, angry residents took to the streets of Atlanta, smashing windows, looting stores and attacking whites. Then-Gov. Zell Miller called in the National Guard, and at least 41 people, many of them police officers, were injured and more than 300 people were arrested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- Six anonymous women began deliberating on Friday whether to convict George Zimmerman for the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in a case that has captivated and divided the U.S. public for the past 16 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">After presiding over 12 days of testimony and two days of closing arguments, Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson turned the case over to a jury sequestered since the trial began last month. They broke for the day without reaching a verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors must reach a unanimous verdict on either second-degree murder, manslaughter or acquittal. A deadlocked jury would result in a mistrial, possibly leading to the whole courtroom drama unfolding once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hours into their meeting, which started at 2:30 p.m., they asked the judge for a full inventory of the evidence. They broke deliberations for the night at 6 p.m. without issuing a verdict and will continue at 9 a.m. Saturday.3rd person in Asiana plane crash dies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">A girl injured in the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash in San Francisco died Friday morning, hospital officials said, marking the third fatality from the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the request of the girl's family, San Francisco General Hospital released limited information about the victim, saying only that she had been listed in critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bodies of two teenage girls were recovered Saturday after the Boeing 777 clipped a sea wall and slammed into a runway at San Francisco International Airport. Officials identified those girls as Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, who were part of a group of Chinese high school students on their way to West Valley Christian Church and School in the San Fernando Valley for a three-week summer camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">San Francisco police confirmed Friday that a firetruck traveling to the scene of the crash hit Ye, though coroner's officials have yet to determine her cause of death.IRS also vetted liberal groups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A Democrat probing Internal Revenue Service scrutiny of conservative &quot;Tea Party&quot; groups released documents on Friday suggesting that &quot;Occupy&quot; and other liberal-leaning groups received extra attention as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives' Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the documents suggested that liberal key words such as &quot;Progressive&quot; and &quot;Occupy&quot; were used by IRS staff to sift through applications for added review, in addition to conservative key words &quot;Tea Party&quot; and &quot;Patriot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; and similar groups have sprouted up in recent years to protest corporate power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cummings blasted the chief of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, who issued a report two months ago that said the agency unfairly singled out conservatives when reviewing applications for tax-exempt status.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, after decades of consideration, has proposed limiting the amount of inorganic arsenic in apple juice to the same level of the potential cancer-causing chemical allowed in U.S. drinking water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the vast majority of apple juice that has been tested by the FDA over the years has contained low levels of inorganic arsenic that were considered safe, the FDA has been wrestling whether to set limits because of the cancer risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency on Friday proposed a limit of 10 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in apple juice, the level set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for arsenic in drinking water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the agency tested 94 samples of arsenic in apple juice and found that all were below the 10 ppb threshold for inorganic arsenic.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) - In an unmistakable setback for George Zimmerman, the jury at the neighborhood watch captain's second-degree murder trial was given the option Thursday of convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson issued her ruling over the objections of Zimmerman's lawyers shortly before a prosecutor delivered a closing argument in which he portrayed the defendant as an aspiring police officer who assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead. He is dead through no fault of his own,&quot; prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jurors. &quot;He is dead because a man made assumptions. ... Unfortunately because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks this Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the judge's ruling, the six jurors will have three options when they start deliberations as early as today: guilty of second-degree murder, guilty of manslaughter and not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman attorney Don West had argued an all-or-nothing strategy, saying the only charge that should be put before the jury is second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state has charged him with second-degree murder. They should be required to prove it,&quot; West said. &quot;If they had wanted to charge him with manslaughter ... they could do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the jury in Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial expected to start deliberating today, many of those same leaders - church elders and community activists - are now joining hands with law enforcement officials in Sanford, South Florida, and elsewhere to urge people to remain calm if Mr Zimmerman is found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We've been spending a fair amount of time trying to figure out what our role should be in this, how to keep the peace and, if it turns out the worst-case scenario, what our next moves should be,'' said Derek Turner, spokesman for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which, coincidentally, is holding its annual convention this weekend in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``We're all in the back of our minds waiting on edge to hear a verdict.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, who is half-Hispanic, allegedly shot Martin, a hoodie-wearing black 17-year-old who was unarmed, last year on a drizzly February 26 night in a gated community near Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing Florida's stand-your-ground law, however, Sanford police originally did not charge Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after social media outrage and civil rights protests alleging racial profiling and discrimination did Governor Rick Scott appoint a special prosecutor, who brought the charges against Zimmerman six weeks after the shooting.</SPAN></P>

(AP) - George Zimmerman's defense attorney began his final arguments Friday, trying to convince six jurors that the neighborhood watch volunteer acted in self-defense when he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O'Mara told jurors the burden was on prosecutors, and they hadn't proven Zimmerman's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. He said prosecutors built a case on a series hypothetical &quot;could've beens&quot; and &quot;maybes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn't been proven, it's not just there,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;You can't fill in the gaps. You can't connect the dots. You're not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six jurors could begin deliberating later Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier, prosecutors made said Zimmerman assumed Martin was a criminal who was up to no good when he confronted him in his neighborhood. A scuffle followed, and Zimmerman fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead. He is dead through no fault of his own,&quot; prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jurors during closing arguments. &quot;He is dead because a man made assumptions. ... Unfortunately because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks this Earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder, but the jury will also be allowed to consider manslaughter. Because of the way Florida law imposes sentences for crimes committed with a gun, the lesser charge could also carry a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson's ruling to allow consideration of the manslaughter charge came despite the objections of Zimmerman's lawyers. The jurors will have three options for their verdict: guilty of second-degree murder, guilty of manslaughter and not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman attorney Don West had argued an all-or-nothing strategy, saying the only charge that should be put before the jury is second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

Or was it precipitated by Trayvon's own actions?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did an angry, hate-filled George Zimmerman &quot;track&quot; Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and, at earliest opportunity, kill him, as prosecutors claim? Or was he a community-conscious and mild-mannered volunteer watchman who can claim &quot;absolute innocence&quot; in the unarmed black teenager's death, as the defense suggests?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clash of two people - an armed adult, an unarmed teenager about 40 pounds lighter - has occupied the country for going on 16 months, and the trial is now winding down into its final days. The trial has gone on for nearly a month, during which the six-woman jury has been sequestered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial is being watched nationally, and with particular interest in Florida, as it's seen widely as a cultural and political commentary on the state of race relations and the impact of liberalized gun laws that make it harder to prosecute people who claim self-defense in contested shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the testimony is complicated and hard evidence scant, the jury's prospects are also basic: Does Mr. Zimmerman, 29, bear responsibility for the death of a teenager? Or was the shooting precipitated by Trayvon's own actions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury is basically being asked to consider a span of a few minutes, from when Zimmerman, who aspired to become a police officer, first spots a &quot;suspicious&quot; person, makes a comment to a police dispatcher that these &quot;[expletives] always get away,&quot; and then follows him on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those actions suggest he's a would-be police officer with a grudge, the prosecution told the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense says Zimmerman acted reasonably and in accordance to instructions from the dispatcher in traveling through a dark passageway where Trayvon had run to check an address. There's also testimony in the case where Zimmerman admits he was scared of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and that earlier he had rolled his window up after he claimed Martin &quot;circled&quot; his SUV. Zimmerman says Trayvon hid and waited for an opportunity to confront, then strike him with a left-handed punch, knocking him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead defense attorney, asked the courtroom to be silent for the four minutes to punctuate the span of time between the point at which Trayvon ran away from Zimmerman and the point of the attack, to suggest that he could have run to where he was staying with his father, but did not. He had told a friend that a &quot;creepy-ass cracker&quot; was following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality of what happened is very straightforward, and it proves absolute innocence,&quot; Mr. O'Mara said. He said Trayvon was &quot;the person who decided that this is going to continue, that this was going to become a violent event, was the guy who didn't go home when he had chance to, the guy who decided to lie in wait, plan his move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An animated video shown by the defense showed Martin, in a hoodie, walking up to Zimmerman, and punching him. Then somehow the two people end up 30 yards away on a concrete sidewalk cut-through in the cookie-cutter neighborhood, where Trayvon can be seen either straddling or laying down on top of Zimmerman. The protracted struggle involved what one witness referred to as a &quot;ground and pound&quot; by Trayvon. Zimmerman had a dislocated nose and small bloody scraped on the back of his head after the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the prosecution, the task of getting to ill will, which is necessary for a conviction of second-degree murder, the original and most severe charge faced by Zimmerman, is partly through pointing out, as another prosecutor said earlier in the trial, that one man is dead and &quot;the other is a liar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury has also been instructed to consider a lesser charge of manslaughter, for which the jury will need to decide that Zimmerman was neglectful in causing Trayvon's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the jury will wrestle will be this, said prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda in his closing argument Thursday: &quot;A man made assumptions, and, unfortunately, because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks on this earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, who had been in trouble at school but had never been arrested, had just bought some candy and a soda at a store and was returning to where his dad was staying in the gated neighborhood when Zimmerman spotted him. Besides the candy and soda, he had $40.15 in his pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors say their evidence shows that Zimmerman &quot;tracked&quot; Martin against a dispatcher's advice, confronted him - &quot;What are you doing around here?&quot; one witness who was on the phone with Trayvon testified - and then pulled his gun out and shot Trayvon after their struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hard evidence has been hard to come by. Zimmerman, who did not testify at trial, said in a police interview that Trayvon was trying to smother his bloodied mouth and nose, but there was no blood found on Trayvon's hands. Zimmerman had said Trayvon reached and grabbed his gun, but forensic experts found only Zimmerman's DNA on the gun. A shriek for help has never been positively identified by science, leaving two mothers - Zimmerman's and Trayvon's - to both identify the yells as coming from their own son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the jury instructions, jurors can consider the entirety of the event, and weigh Zimmerman's decisions against decisions made by Trayvon in the run-up to their tragic encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor told the jury to &quot;use your God-given common sense&quot; to make a decision. O'Mara warned the jury to &quot;be careful with your common sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Jurors began deliberations Friday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">791 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers in the George Zimmerman murder trial cited America's Founding Fathers, a civil rights icon, and the US Constitution on Friday as they sought to make last impressions with the jury, which is now deliberating a verdict that will define justice for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a slain black teenager, and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers' portentous references, made in closing arguments of an emotional month-long trial, are intended to frame the case for a jury of six women - five whites and one Hispanic, five of whom are mothers. But the references also alluded to the sensitive political and racial issues that have swirled around the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his appeal to the jury, defense attorney Mark O'Mara cited John Adams on the presumption of innocence and Thomas Jefferson on the importance of citizen juries before laying out his contention that Mr. Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch captain, is &quot;factually innocent&quot; of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution,&quot; Mr. O'Mara said, quoting Jefferson. Then he told jurors, &quot;You are living the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda, in his closing arguments to the jury Thursday, asked jurors to look past the unsophistication of the state's star witness, Rachel Jeantel, and to glean the meaning of her testimony about her phone call with Trayvon on the night he died, specifically that she heard him yell &quot;Get off!&quot; before the connection was broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times hard to understand and fond of &quot;colorful language&quot; - such as calling Mr. De la Rionda &quot;that bald-headed dude&quot; - Ms. Jeantel nevertheless provided what prosecutors contend is a key piece of information that should lead to Zimmerman's conviction on second-degree murder or manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. De la Rionda put his own twist on the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when he told jurors: &quot;A witness will not be judged on the color of her personality but by the content of her testimony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial expert Bob Dekle, a professor at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, says defense lawyers especially like to &quot;flag-wave&quot; in cases in which they don't have much of a defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aphorisms and proverbs and quoting historical personages is an aspect of trial advocacy that goes back 2,000 years,&quot; he says. &quot;Usually defense lawyers talk about the Constitution and the presumption of innocence when they can't talk about anything else.&quot; O'Mara, however, built a legitimate self-defense case for Zimmerman, Mr. Dekle says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weighty constitutional references underscore the stakes in the high-profile trial concerning the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who had just turned 17 when he was fatally shot. After walking to a convenience store, he was headed back to the home where his dad was staying in a gated Sanford, Fla., neighborhood when Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, spotted and followed him. After the two got into a fight, Zimmerman fired on Trayvon, his lawyers claim, in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident stirred widespread rallies and protests when Sanford police declined to arrest Zimmerman, saying they could not counter his self-defense claim under a new Florida law that allows citizens wide latitude to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beginning, many Americans, especially blacks, viewed the incident through the lens of civil rights. Had the roles of the main players been reversed - if an armed black man had followed and then killed a white teenager, and then claimed self-defense - they doubt the police would have acted in the same way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Zimmerman supporters, the case touches on basic constitutional precepts around the Second Amendment's guarantee, as outlined by the US Supreme Court, that citizens can carry weapons to use for personal self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear whether the lawyers' historical references will have much influence on the jury of mostly middle-aged women, or whether other impressions will matter more. Some analysts posit that an all-female jury could lean toward Zimmerman because they, too, worry about crime and possible home invasions from young criminals. Others say they may lean toward the prosecution because the evidence may fuel fears that their own children could become embroiled in a similar deadly encounter with an adult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury received the case Friday afternoon and began deliberating whether Zimmerman is guilty of second-degree murder, for which the state must prove Zimmerman shot Trayvon with &quot;hate in his heart,&quot; as prosecutor John Guy has said he did, or of manslaughter, where culpable negligence is the standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's status as a minor and the fact that he was killed with a firearm could become aggravating factors in sentencing - if the jury finds Zimmerman guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; has come under some fire for a fictional scene and the film's promotion being tied to the George Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie from Oakland director Ryan Coogler details the final day of Oscar Grant, who was shot and killed by a BART officer on Jan. 1, 2009. The film is out in limited release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler has confirmed that in filling in some blanks in Grant's day, he added a fictitious scene in which Grant befriends a dog that is later hit and killed by a car. A Huffington Post reporter asked Coogler if that scene could be considered manipulative by making an animal-loving Grant more likable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yeah, but that's not the intention,&quot; Coogler told the reporter. &quot;That's not the intention to show that this guy's a great guy. That wasn't the intention at all. And that's fine, that's the risk that you run with a scene like that. I can tell you what the scene was about and why it's there -- because, it's funny, it's a very polarizing scene. Some people get the intention and it's their favorite scene in the movie. Some people hate the whole movie because of the scene. Like, 'I feel manipulated.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler added that the scene was important to him and actor Michael B. Jordan, who played Grant, because of Grant's fondness for pit bulls, a dog breed that often makes the news for its aggressive behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You never hear about a pit bull doing anything good in the media,&quot; Coogler said in the Huffington Post interview. &quot;And they have a stigma to them ... and, in many ways, pit bulls are like young African-American males. Whenever you see us in the news, it's for getting shot and killed or shooting and killing somebody -- for being a stereotype. And that's what you see for African-Americans in the media and the news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The limited release for &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; also comes as closing arguments are made in the George Zimmerman trial, and some of the film's promotional material is being tied to that trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is on trial for shooting black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida, which Zimmerman said was an act of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A marketing photo on &quot;Fruitvale's&quot; Facebook page shows an image of Jordan as Grant and a quote from Coogler: &quot;Anytime someone's life is lost and there's an inkling of politics involved, that person is not around to defend himself and his character gets pulled in different directions depending on what side of the fence you sit on. We saw it happen with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and it shows no signs of slowing down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TV ads for &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; also began airing during coverage of the Zimmerman trial, although ad reps for Weinstein Company have told news outlets that the ads were about reaching a &quot;crossover audience&quot; that includes cable news, not necessarily about linking to the actual trail coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entertainment and political publicist Angie Meyer criticized the marketing campaign in FOX411's Pop Tarts column: &quot;It's absolutely inappropriate and morally wrong to use a high profile case to create publicity and buzz around a movie release. But capitalize on political bias and a high-profile case together, and Hollywood thrives on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weinstein Company has not yet responded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERE WAS THE beginning of the end of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life, Feb. 26, 2012, George Zimmerman - an overheated pretend cop with a very real gun - making a call to the dispatcher at the Sanford, Fla., Police Department:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;Hey, we've had some break-ins in my neighborhood, and there's a real suspicious guy, uh, Retreat View Circle. . . . This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: &quot;Okay, and this guy is he white, black or Hispanic?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;He looks black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: &quot;Did you see what he was wearing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;Yeah, a dark hoodie, like a gray hoodie, and either jeans or sweatpants and white tennis shoes. He was just staring . . .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later on in the call Zimmerman said: &quot;Something's wrong with him. Yup, he's coming to check me out, he's got something in his hands. I don't know what the deal is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later still, George Zimmerman was asked by the dispatcher whether he was following Trayvon&nbsp;Martin: Teenager, black, hoodie, the &quot;something&quot; in his hands was a bag of Skittles and a can of Arizona Iced Tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;Yeah (I'm following him).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispatcher: &quot;Okay, we don't need you to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman: &quot;Okay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know about the rest of the story, one about another senseless gun death in America, one that has played out to a Florida courtroom, all the way to the closing arguments in a case that finally saw Zimmerman charged with second-degree murder. On Thursday Judge Debra Nelson allowed the jury to consider a lesser charge of manslaughter against Zimmerman, which may increase the prosecution's chance of getting a conviction, after the whole thing seemed to be going against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors also tried to include the possibility of third-degree murder, arguing that Zimmerman had committed child abuse by shooting and killing an underage teen. Defense attorney Don West called that a trick, the judge rejected the argument, but not before saying this to West:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to hear the trick anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the real trick in this trial was defense attorneys trying to convince the jury and the world that Zimmerman was the victim here. But he was the one with the gun, and the one still around. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who wasn't carrying a weapon even though Zimmerman clearly thought he was, is gone. Gun wins, he dies, at 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only nobody dies at Retreat View Circle if Zimmerman had done what the dispatcher asked him to do and just walked away. But he didn't. There had been those previous break-ins and now Zimmerman - thinking he was the law, made brave by a gun - had decided in the night and in the rain that the black kid in the hoodie was a threat; Zimmerman apparently working off all the experience gained in all of his fantasies about being in law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that an acquittal in this case means that Zimmerman is innocent, or the kind of right-wing vigilante hero that people wanted Bernhard Goetz to be on a New York subway once, means you think Trayvon&nbsp;Martin somehow deserved to die for the crime of looking suspicious to a dumb, overheated amateur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goetz thought he was about to be robbed by four black guys and turned out to have a gun on him and started shooting, paralyzing one of them, Darrell Cabey. Cabey would tell Jimmy Breslin, for a column in this newspaper, that he and the guys with him thought that Goetz was &quot;easy bait.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are never going to know who ended up on top in the fight between Zimmerman and Martin, clearly we are never going to know whose voice was doing the screaming on a later 911 call placed to the Sanford dispatcher. And no one would ever say that the prosecution has made its case against Zimmerman, especially in a state like Florida where you can absolutely can get away with murder if able to prove that you felt threatened, because of the state's dim-bulb stand-your-ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end the members of the jury will decide on the merits of the case they have been presented, a case that was all about race from its first moments, even though nobody wanted to talk about that very much in the courtroom. Certainly not Zimmerman himself, who elected not to take the stand in his own defense, feeling he had proved that he was only defending himself against Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman walks on this, it means the facts never changed after that night in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun won, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who started this, who followed who?&quot; prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda said in his closing argument. &quot;And who was armed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda is right, of course, it is the whole ballgame. Who really was the &quot;bait&quot; that night at Retreat View Circle before Zimmerman's gun went off - the 17-year-old black kid in the hoodie or the guy with the gun who said this to the dispatcher during his call to 911:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These a------es always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes they get away with murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents Sabrina Fulton and Tracy Martin stand in court after the state's closing arguments Thursday in the trial of George Zimmerman, who is accused of murder in Martin's death. Closing arguments continue today in Sanford, Fla. GARY W. GREEN / ORLANDO SENTINEL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gladys Zimmerman looks to her husband Robert Zimmerman Sr. during closing arguments for the state in their son George Zimmerman's trial in Sanford, Fla., on Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not since the trial of O.J. Simpson has a criminal case tinged with race riveted the country the way the George Zimmerman trial in Florida has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vernellia Randall, a local law expert in race relations, said the case fascinates people because it challenges views of what constitutes racism, particularly among people who strongly want to believe we have a color-blind society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have said race was involved in the delay in charging Zimmerman after he shot and killed an unarmed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, claiming self-defense. Others wonder why more attention has been not focused on Zimmerman's right to defend himself when allegedly threatened by Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict could come any day as the prosecution gave its closing arguments Thursday in an Orlando suburb courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was threatening because of his color,&quot; Randall said. &quot;Because he was a young black man walking in a place where he was perceived not to belong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said they same thing could happen to a white man in a predominately black neighborhood, as &quot;we get suspicious. Is that racism? I think it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the outcome would have been different, she said, if a black man had followed a white man because he found him suspicious, and the white man was shot to death. In that case, she said, it would be &quot;impossible to imagine&quot; that the black man wouldn't be arrested immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. On the night of the fatal scu?e in February 2012, Martin was visiting his father and his father's fiancee at the same townhome complex where Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman observed Martin while driving in his neighborhood, called police and the fight ensued after the neighborhood watch volunteer got out of his vehicle. Zimmerman claims Martin was slamming his head into the concrete pavement when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though prosecutors said Zimmerman thought he &quot;assumed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a criminal,&quot; Randall said that explanation leaves out why - because Martin was black - and that factor is what is driving public interest in the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of racial motivations is separate from the question of whether Zimmerman is guilty of murder, or as added Thursday, of manslaughter, Randall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is what we're not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GARY W. GREEN / ORLANDO SENTINEL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discussing, and we're using this trial as a proxy for it,&quot; Randall said. &quot;And I think that's a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Judge Debra Nelson ruled that jurors can consider the lesser charge of manslaughter, as requested by prosecutors, and that will be included in the jury instructions. Prosecutors started closing arguments, the defense goes today and the jury could have the high-profile case before the weekend starts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Hagel, a UD law professor, said the instruction allows for a &quot;compromise verdict,&quot; allowing the jury to go with another option if jurors find that prosecutors didn't make the case for murder, but don't want to let Zimmerman go completely free. He said jurors probably felt &quot;incredible pressure,&quot; given the national attention the case has garnered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman profiled the 17-year-old, assuming he was up to no good, and that led to the Miami teen's death, a prosecutor said Thursday in closing arguments of the neighborhood watch volunteer's second-degree murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead. He is dead through no fault of his own,&quot; prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told jurors. &quot;He is dead because a man made assumptions... Unfortunately because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks this earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda dismissed defense claims that Zimmerman acted in self-defense, accusing the neighborhood watch volunteer of lying about what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman showed ill will and hatred when he whispered profanities to a police dispatcher over his cell phone while following Martin, de la Rionda said. In order to get a second-degree conviction, prosecutors must show Zimmerman showed ill will, hatred or spite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The law doesn't allow people to take the law into their own hands,&quot; de la Rionda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor also showed jurors a head-shot photo of Martin taken from his autopsy. Jurors trained their eyes on de la Rionda, barely taking notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge denied a request for the jury also to consider third-degree murder after a defense attorney called the proposal &quot;outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor Richard Mantei argued that instructions for third-degree murder should be included on the premise that Zimmerman committed child abuse when he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because Martin was underage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But defense attorney Don West called the proposed instruction &quot;a trick,&quot; and he accused the prosecutor of springing it on the defense at the last minute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if more evidence were needed about the tragedy of black education, Rachel Jeantel, a witness for the prosecution in the George Zimmerman murder trial, put a face on it for the nation to see. Some of that evidence unfolded when Zimmerman's defense attorney asked 19-year-old Jeantel to read a letter she allegedly had written to Trayvon Martin's mother. She responded that she doesn't read cursive, and that's in addition to her poor grammar, syntax and communication skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel is a senior at Miami Norland Senior High School. How in the world did she manage to become a 12th-grader without being able to read cursive writing? That's a skill one would expect from a fourth-grader. Jeantel is by no means an exception at her school. Here are a few achievement scores from her school: Thirty-nine percent of the students score basic for reading, and 38 percent score below basic. In math, 37 percent score basic, and 50 percent score below basic. Below basic is the score when a student is unable to demonstrate even partial mastery of knowledge and skills fundamental for proficient work at his grade level. Basic indicates only partial mastery. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few Americans, particularly black Americans, have any idea of the true magnitude of the black education tragedy. The education establishment might claim that it's not their fault. They're not responsible for the devastation caused by female-headed families, drugs, violence and the culture of dependency. But they are totally responsible for committing gross educational fraud. It's educators who graduated Jeantel from elementary and middle school and continued to pass her along in high school. It's educators who will, in June 2014, confer upon her a high-school diploma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just Florida's schools. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, nationally most black 12th-graders test either basic or below basic in reading, writing, math and science. Drs. Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom wrote in their 2004 book, &quot;No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning,&quot; &quot;Blacks nearing the end of their high-school education perform a little worse than white eighth-graders in both reading and U.S. history, and a lot worse in math and geography.&quot; Little has changed since the book's publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drexel University history and political science professor George Ciccariello-Maher disapprovingly says that the reaction to Jeantel's court performance &quot;has been in terms of aesthetics, of disregarding a witness on the basis of how she talks, how good she is at reading and writing.&quot; Harking back to Jim Crow days, he adds: &quot;These are subtle things that echo literacy testing at the polls, echo the question of whether black Americans can testify against white people, of being always suspect in their testimony. It's the same old dynamics emerging in a very different guise.&quot; Then there's Morgan Polikoff, assistant professor of education at the University of Southern California, who says: &quot;Cursive should be allowed to die. In fact, it's already dying, despite having been taught for decades.&quot; That's the kind of educational philosophy that accounts for much of our nation's educational decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The educational system and black family structure and culture have combined to make increasing numbers of young black people virtually useless in the increasingly high-tech world of the 21st century. Too many people believe that pouring more money into schools will help. That's whistling' &quot;Dixie.&quot; Whether a student is black or white, poor or rich, there are some minimum requirements that must be met in order to do well in school. Someone must make the student do his homework, see to it that he gets a good night's sleep, fix a breakfast, make sure he gets to school on time and make sure he respects and obeys his teachers. Here are my questions: Which one of those requirements can be achieved through a higher school budget? Which can be achieved by politicians? If those minimal requirements aren't met, whatever else is done is mostly for naught.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor in Trayvon Martin's murder trial says neighbourhood watch leader was a wannabe cop 'sick and tired' of criminals <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was a wannabe cop who profiled his victim Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a criminal then &quot;silenced&quot; him with a gun he considered his &quot;equaliser,&quot; a prosecutor said on Thursday in closing arguments at the neighbourhood watch leader's murder trial in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting as a vigilante who was &quot;sick and tired&quot; of criminals coming into his Sanford gated community, Zimmerman made and acted upon wrong assumptions, state attorney Bernie de la Rionda said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To quote the defendant, 'these fucking punks', 'these assholes, they always get away'. He uttered it under his breath and that in itself indicates ill will and hatred,&quot; he said, referring to a recording of a non-emergency call Zimmerman made to police on the night of February 26 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He followed him, he tracked him, because in his mind this was a criminal. He went over the line. He assumed things that weren't true and [acted] instead of waiting for the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does this defendant get out of his car if he thinks that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a threat? Because he's got a gun, he's got the equaliser, he's gonna take care of it, he's a wannabe cop, it's his community and he's not going to put up with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, admits killing the unarmed Martin, 17, but denies second-degree murder on the grounds of self-defence, arguing it was the younger man who initiated their fatal confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The episode sparked civil rights protests when Zimmerman, of mixed white-Hispanic parentage, was not arrested or charged with killing the black teenager for 44 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The all-female jury of six is expected to retire on Friday afternoon to consider its verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After presenting what many analysts believe to have been a weak case over three weeks, de la Rionda delivered a powerful closing statement that played up Martin as an innocent victim. The teenager was, he said, walking back to the house of his father's fianc&eacute;e to watch a basketball game with his step-brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead. He is dead through no fault of his own. He is dead because another man made assumptions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was there legally, he had not broken in, sneaked in or trespassed. He went to a 7-Eleven. What was his crime? He bought Skittles and some kind of watermelon iced tea. He was minding his own business but apparently this defendant decided he was up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, he said, was &quot;caught in numerous lies&quot; and exaggerated the circumstances of the encounter and his own injuries to convince police he had done nothing wrong. He said the fact there was no blood or DNA under Martin's fingernails should make the jury question Zimmerman's account of a violent brawl and of Martin straddling him and smashing his head on a concrete pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He silenced Trayvon&nbsp;Martin but even in silence his body provides evidence as to this defendant's guilt, that this defendant is lying about what happened,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he was really having his head bashed in, why isn't his jacket all torn up or at least scratched up, if he was being picked up over and over? Where did all of the defendant's blood go?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defendant claims he was the only one yelling out there. If he's yelling, and if he's down, and he's got all this blood and he's swallowing the blood, how does he get to do all that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda addressed the appearance of several witnesses, including that of Rachel Jeantel, a friend who said she was on the phone to Martin just before he was shot. During often incoherent testimony, she said he told her he was being followed by a &quot;creepy-ass Cracker,&quot; a derogatory racial term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is not a very sophisticated person and not the most educated, but she's a human being and she spoke as best she could,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe her language was a little colourful but did she speak the truth? She was the person that was speaking to the victim.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paraphrasing Martin Luther King Jr, he added: &quot;I had a dream that today a witness would be judged not on the colour of her personality but on the content of her testimony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda urged the jury to rely on three things as they considered their verdict, the testimony and physical evidence, the law that judge Debra Nelson will read to them and their &quot;God-given common sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You will come back with a verdict that speaks the truth, a verdict that is just, and that verdict would be that this defendant is guilty of murder in the second degree,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel will consider two charges, second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of at least 25 years, and manslaughter, with a penalty of up to 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson rejected an attempt by the state to introduce a charge of third-degree murder based on child abuse. Defence lawyert Don West denounced the proposal, introduced during morning discussions over instructions for the jury, as &quot;a trick&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just when I didn't think this case could get any more bizarre, the state is alleging child abuse?&quot; he said. &quot;This is outrageous. It's outrageous the state would seek to do this at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamila Aisha Brown: We would probably never have heard of her. The lives of black women are valued little by white society or the black community <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were a black woman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN host Piers Morgan posed this hypothetical question to Marc Lamont Hill on Tuesday night:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if Trayvon had been a young black woman and she had been scared by being followed by this guy? If it had been a young black woman walking home and she had turned around and punched him in the face, for argument's sake, we wouldn't be having this conversation, would we? He would have been convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hill agreed, remarking that black men are viewed as &quot;purveyors of violence&quot; and not as victims. But what about the scores of unnamed black women whose killings have been largely ignored and all but forgotten? A look through history proves that from lynchings, to intimate partner violence, to police brutality, the murders of black women in the United States have rarely evoked much empathy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to the Morgan-Hill thesis, I contend that if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were a young black woman, we would not even know her name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's murder and subsequent profiling have been likened by some to the lynchings of black men that stained American history during the 19th and 20th centuries, casting him as a latter-day Emmett Till. But popular memory has virtually erased the lynchings of Mary Turner, Marie Scott and Laura Nelson and the 115 black women, who were hung alongside their husbands, brothers and sons. The strange fruit of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">stranger</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sex that also dangled from southern trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was neither much sympathy nor outrage over the death of Deanna Cook Patrick, who was found dead in her bathtub two days after she called 911 for help in August 2012. Deanna had suffered a known history of violence at the hands of her attacker: her ex-husband Delvecchio Patrick had been arrested for assaulting her three times, and pleaded guilty to all three charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Deanna told the 911 operator that Delvecchio had tried to kill her three times before, the dispatcher failed to mark her call as &quot;urgent&quot; or report it as a &quot;murder in progress&quot;. Subsequently, two police officers arrived at Deanna's home 50 minutes later, but left when no one answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the name Rekia Boyd sound at all familiar? Only weeks after Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's murder, Detective Dante Servin gunned down the 22-year-old Rekia on the west side of Chicago, yet her name has largely escaped the media spotlight. Like Trayvon, Rekia was a passer-by, her life taken in the middle of the night by a single shot. While the family of Rekia Boyd was awarded $4.5m in March 2013, a year after her death, Detective Servin faces no criminal charges to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones was shot to death as she slept on the couch with her grandmother during a midnight Swat raid on her home in 2010. Last month, three years after her death, the child's killer, police officer Joseph Weekley, walked from a Detroit courtroom after his involuntary manslaughter case was declared a mistrial. Where were the headlines and protests?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, why are female victims so often omitted from the narratives of violence African Americans face?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black feminist scholar bell hooks says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No other group in America has so had their identity socialized out of existence, as have black women ... When black people are talked about the focus tends to be on black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could explain why Marc Lamont Hill failed to cite the names of African-American women like Rekia Boyd, whose family grieves alongside the Martins. Black women's names are too often left out of rally cries against senseless violence. We remember Oscar Grant, Amadou Diallo, and Sean Bell, but how many march for Tarika Wilson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the victimization of young women is subsumed into a general well of black pain that is largely defined by the struggles of African-American men. As a result, any insight about this important intersection of race and gender is lost under the umbrella of a collective sense of persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Piers Morgan's assertion that if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin were female, then her case would assure a guilty verdict, all the evidence suggests otherwise. The same social and cultural protections afforded white women are not readily granted to African-American women and girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had been a young black woman, no police chief would have resigned over a bungled investigation. No CNN host would be discussing the case of her accused killer. And we wouldn't be livestreaming her murder trial and hanging on every word of each witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is we would probably never have heard of her.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara uses props including full-size cutouts and slab of concrete in three-and-a-half hour attack on prosecution's case <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's defence attorney urged a jury on Friday not to rely on &quot;could have beens&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot; to determine the neighbourhood watch leader's guilt or innocence in the murder of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his closing arguments at Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial in Sanford, Florida, Mark O'Mara said it was &quot;a bizarro case&quot; in which prosecutors themselves had proven his client's &quot;pure, unadulterated innocence&quot; beyond a reasonable doubt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What aren't words of good prosecutors are maybe, what if, I hope so, you figure it out, could have been,&quot; O'Mara said, referring to Thursday's closing arguments by state attorney Bernie de la Rionda, after three weeks of testimony. &quot;Defence lawyers are the ones who live in could have beens and what ifs. If you have to presume something, you don't know it, and if you don't know it, it hasn't been proven. Don't connect dots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson sent out the jury of six women on Friday afternoon to decide if Zimmerman, 29, acted with &quot;ill will, spite or hatred&quot; when he shot and killed the unarmed black teenager in Sanford's Retreat at Twin Lakes gated community on 26 February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who pleaded not guilty on the grounds of self-defence and who has argued that Martin, 17, began the confrontation with a &quot;sucker punch&quot; that broke his nose, faces at least 25 years in jail if convicted of murder, or up to 30 years if found guilty on a lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara spent three and a half hours on Friday morning attacking the prosecution's case, using graphics, slides and props, including full size cut-outs of the defendant and victim and even a large slab of concrete he dumped on the courtroom floor. The cement, he said, proved Martin was not unarmed because he used the pavement as a weapon on which he slammed Zimmerman's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara denounced the prosecution's portrayal of Zimmerman as an angry neighbourhood busybody and vigilante who was fed up with a string of burglaries in his housing development, and who pursued and shot Martin because he made the assumption that the hoodie-wearing teenager was a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donning sunglasses and a large ring on his little finger, O'Mara told the jury: &quot;If I were to walk I today like this, [you'd ask] 'What in God's name is he doing with the sunglasses on, who does he think he is? What's with the pinkie ring?' That's all it takes, is an impression. My fear is that it works against my client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not one witness in there who will say, 'George Zimmerman, yeah the guy wandering round the neighbourhood, looking around, telling people to bring in their garbage cans,' or some absurdity like that. Not one witness to suggest that the guy is who they want you to believe he is, that neighbourhood watch cop wannabe crazy rider walking the neighbourhood looking for someone to harass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he said it was only his obligation to introduce reasonable doubt, O'Mara said he would assume the burden of proving Zimmerman's innocence to the jury. Addressing the timeline of events of the night of the shooting, he said it contained gaps and inconsistencies. There was no proof, he said, that Zimmerman followed Martin after a request not to by a police dispatcher handling the defendant's call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is there any evidence that George Zimmerman ran anywhere or that he ran after Trayvon&nbsp;Martin after he said OK? If it's there I missed it,&quot; he said.There was a lengthy silence in the courtroom as O'Mara highlighted what he said was a &quot;missing&quot; four minutes on the state's timeline that Martin probably used to work out his next move, which was circling back and attacking Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not going to allow you or the state to ignore the realities of what actually happened that night,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning to the prosecution's theme of Zimmerman as an overzealous, self-appointed guardian of his neighbourhood, O'Mara referred to a series of calls he made to police over a six-month period to report suspicious people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What did they show you to buttress their position that George Zimmerman is before you acting with ill will, spite or hatred, and just hated Trayvon&nbsp;Martin that night?&quot; he said. &quot;The phone calls to non-emergency? That's about it. I would suggest that's on the way towards absolute innocence. Listen to the calls. Anger, frustration, hatred, ill will, spite? 'Get out here and get these guys? I hate these young black males'. Do not allow them to give their words to your ears rather than George's. Listen to what he said, the cadence of his voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, left the courtroom as O'Mara discussed the autopsy photographs that were taken of her son. He concluded by running through the testimony of witnesses one by one, and asking the jury to rely only on the facts as they completed their &quot;very difficult task&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rebuttal, prosecutor John Guy also mentioned Zimmerman's call to the police non-emergency line, in which he was recorded saying: &quot;Fucking punks&quot; and &quot;these assholes, they always get away&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a man speaks, so is he,&quot; Guy said. &quot;If ever there was a window into a man's soul, it was the words from that defendant's mouth on that phone call. There's only two people who know what really happened. One of them can't testify and the other one lied.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small but vocal group of demonstrators appear outside courthouse but Sanford police insist there is no cause for alarm <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups of demonstrators began to appear outside the Seminole County courthouse soon after the jury in George Zimmerman's murder trial was sent out to deliberate on Friday afternoon, as a sheriff declared there was &quot;no tension&quot; in the community and the defendant's family issued a statement appealing for calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small but vocal handful of protesters carrying &quot;I am Trayvon&quot; banners and calling for justice gathered in the rain on the lawn outside the criminal justice center in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference inside, Donald Eslinger, the sheriff of Seminole County, said preparations had been made for any civil unrest but that there was no suggestion of it happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recognise that this case has stirred up a great deal of emotion but we're not seeing tension here in Seminole County,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no party involved in this case that wants to see any violence and we have every expectation upon the announcement of this verdict that our community and its visitors will continue to act peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not tolerate anyone who uses this verdict as an excuse to violate the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Zimmerman, the defendant's brother, released a statement on behalf of his family, noting that the judicial system had run its course. &quot;George's fate is now in the hands of the jury who will make their decision based on evidence and the facts of the case,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we await a verdict we will remain hopeful and ask for the public to remain peaceful no matter the outcome. Though we maintain George committed no crime whatsoever, we acknowledge that the people who called for George's arrest and subsequent trial have now witnessed both events come to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope now that as Americans we will all respect the rule of law, which begins with respecting the verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cecil Smith, chief of the Sanford police department, said much progress had been made in community relations in the city since the shooting, and that civil rights protests last year passed off with no arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifteen months ago, 30,000-odd people showed up here and during that same time they requested that several things take place,&quot; he said. &quot;They wanted an investigation, they asked for an arrest, they asked for charges to be made and they asked for a trial. Each of those things has taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a trying time for all of us. We're not sure what the verdict is going to bring but it's a great opportunity for evolution of the Sanford community. When this trial passes it will still be our community, when the cameras have gone and the lights are no longer shining on Sanford it will still be our community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Martin's home town of Miami, a police spokesman said it was &quot;coincidence&quot; that officers had practiced riot training with horses and batons two days before the jury was sent out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sources said that the Miami-Dade police department's intelligence unit had been monitoring social media sites for &quot;unusual interest&quot; in the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vibert White, an associate professor of history at the University of Central Florida and an expert in African American studies who has lectured on the case, told the Guardian that he doubted there would be widespread protests if Zimmerman was acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For months, Justice Department personnel known as 'peacekeepers' have been working closely with black leadership in Sanford, Deland, Orlando and even Miami advising or instructing them what to do, say, and act in reference to civil rights activism,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For months, they have pushed the ideal that leaders must continue to say, 'let's have peace' as if a racial spark is ready to ignite the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore blacks, except for a few rowdy kids and crews, are too afraid to radically protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone under the impression that we had somehow managed to move  past the race problem in this country was, it turns out, sadly  mistaken. In case you hadn't heard, most recent evidence of this  ongoing divide among races came to light this week in Milford,  Conn., a coastal city of more than 50,000 on Long Island Sound.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A group calling itself the United Klans of America, surely a  distant shell of the once all-powerful Ku Klux Klan organizations  that dealt such devastation and hatred and death in this country  through much of the 20th century, decided the good citizens of  Milford needed some help with their neighborhood safety. According  to news reports, fliers distributed by the group were aimed at  advertising a neighborhood watch group.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bradley Jenkins, imperial wizard of the Alabama-based white  supremacist group, said the fliers were meant to deter criminals  who have been breaking into cars in the city. The fliers read:  &quot;Neighborhood Watch: You can sleep well tonight knowing the UKA is  awake.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Authorities told The Associated Press there has not been a rash of  car break-ins. That's no surprise. That sort of cause-and-effect  reasoning has never been the stock in trade of the Klan or any  other like-minded hate group. Lies and half-truths are their bread  and butter, just enough fuel to drive ordinary people to suspect  any other individual who might not look like them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    To their credit, Connecticut elected officials, law enforcement  officials and many residents of Milford came out forcefully and en  masse to discredit the UKA's efforts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Let's be very clear: Klan and Klan-affiliated organizations are  not welcome in Connecticut,&quot; Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said at a  Wednesday press conference. &quot;No one in their right mind is asking  you to be here, and I mean that.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;This did not just shock Milford. It shocked the state of  Connecticut,&quot; Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman said. &quot;You know, the people of  Milford can do very, very well without the Klan around.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center,  based in Alabama, which tracks racist and hate groups, described  the UKA as a &quot;very, very weak group.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Which is why it would be so tempting to ignore these people, to  simply let them have their say and let them exercise their First  Amendment rights to free speech as long as they don't violate some  sort of local ordinance against fliers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Indeed, I thought about ignoring it, too, until I remembered that  much of the nation is transfixed these days by a murder trial going  on down in a Sanford, Fla., courthouse, a trial that holds racial  tensions, a trial that is being held largely because one man,  George Zimmerman, a &quot;neighborhood watch volunteer,&quot; decided he knew  more about public safety than local police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Certainly, we don't know how the trial seeking answers about the  death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin will be resolved. We  don't know why Zimmerman, on trial for second-degree murder, did  not testify in his own defense. Indeed, there is much we don't know  about what happened on that rainy night in what appears to have  been a physical struggle between Martin and Zimmerman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    What we do know is that had Zimmerman stayed in his car and not  been so overzealous in his &quot;duties&quot; with the neighborhood watch,  then Martin might still be alive and we would have been spared one  more searing reminder of the racial divide that still exists in  this country.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Of course, when you talk about it, when people like me write about  it, we carry the risk of heightening the problem.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    But maybe the problem is we don't talk about it enough.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Maybe people who are members of such groups as the United Klans of  America, regardless of how small their reach, need to be reminded  that sensibilities in this nation have changed, that the  overwhelming majority of Americans, no matter their race, religion  or sexual orientation, have grown weary of fighting these old and  senseless and demeaning battles.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With stories from the NSA scandal to Paula Deen's downfall to the George Zimmerman trial, we're in the midst of what is already destined to be remembered as one of those great viral summers. It's reminiscent of the summer media frenzy of 1992, when Long Island Lolita Amy Fisher shot Mary Jo Buttafuoco, Woody Allen bedded stepdaughter Soon Yi Previn, and thousands rioted in Los Angeles after the cops who beat Rodney King were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in both cases, the cultural contagion and resulting confusion may have had less to do with the stories themselves than the new technologies through which they were being transmitted. When media change, so too does our perception of the world. Everything old seems new again, even though it's really just a repeat of some earlier trope. Second verse, same as the first &amp;hellip; now in 3D!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the early 1990s, we were in the very beginning of the new media age. And by new media, I don't mean the websites and social networks we're on today. No, I'm talking about fax machines, reality television, cable news, the VCR, and the camcorder. These new media turned the broadcast universe on its head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only were office workers delightedly faxing each other &quot;blonde&quot; jokes, but stories that may not have seen the light of day in the old media universe suddenly moved to center stage. Black men in Los Angeles had already been facing police brutality on a nightly basis. But the addition of camcorders into the consumer electronics arsenal made the recording of at least one instance of such brutality inevitable. A private citizen happened to be in the right place at the right time, CNN and other 24-hour news channels couldn't help but broadcast the unedited footage the moment they received it, and the rest is history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rodney King tape was spread throughout the media overnight not because a black man was being beaten. No, the initial story was simply that such an event had been captured by a camcorder! This was a story about the power of a new medium - so much so, that one electronics company put a full page ad in Rolling Stone featuring a black fist holding a camcorder with the caption, &quot;The Power Is in Your Hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, the reality dramas of the Amy Fisher trial played out on new cable court television shows as well as in crash-edited television movies put out by all the major networks to run alongside the news-in-progress. This was a new, media-driven sensibility as well. 1992 was the year MTV's archetypal reality series Real World launched, bringing with it a new television-as-live-surveillance ethos -- as well as an emphasis on tragedy and humiliation. The lines between news and entertainment were blurring: Vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle debated fictional TV news reporter Murphy Brown, and lost.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, I came up with the term &quot;viral media&quot; to describe this new ability of stories to reach epidemic levels, mutating and replicating as they moved from person to person, show to show, news to fiction and back again. Our cultural fascinations were changing along with the styles of media we used to consume and spread them. All this contagion seemed threatening at the time, but in hindsight, the era of the slow-motion O.J. Simpson police chase, Beavis and Butt-head, Madonna and Michael Jackson, or even the first computer viruses appear almost quaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, our social media amplify and accelerate word of mouth to a new level. These aren't hushed water-cooler conversation about whatever salacious gossip we've seen on the news; they are publicly broadcasted pronouncements about who is a hero, who is a traitor, who is a liar, or who is a fraud. In a media culture that values retweets and &quot;likes&quot; even more than money, stories spread and replicate less because they titillate than because they are suitable subjects for loud, definitive, 140-character declarations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of the NSA scandal to public opinion about security vs. privacy gives way to a polarized shouting match over Edward Snowden's patriotism. Paula Deen used the N-word, serving as this summer's mandatory litmus test on racial slurs: Can we forgive her? No. And Trayvon Martin becomes the smartphone era's version of Rodney King, as jurists try to piece together a narrative from cell calls instead of videotape. We can only imagine, if Zimmerman goes free, what race riots organized via Facebook might look like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All along the way, mainstream media news is as powerless to resist the rising tide of Twitter as its predecessors were to resist the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; fomented by Jerry Springer and the National Enquirer. As if desperate to find content relevant to stories that are moving just too slow for the pace of their news shows, cable channels end up reading Tweets and Facebook posts on the air. The trending waves of social media are really the only aspect of these stories that matter to people, anyway. They're more emotional mirrors -- or at least they are used that way -- than they are actionable news and information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why when we look at the kinds of stories making the headlines, we have to remind ourselves that the particular characters and events within them are not really so important in themselves. For every &quot;white trash&quot; murder story in rotation on Court TV, there are a dozen more that never make the cut. Even the current NSA scandal is just one of a series of similar leaks and otherwise boring New York Times section-one stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, it's all about timing. Social media is more like a standing wave, just waiting for the right kind of content to fill it. So our anxiousness about big data surveillance -- an idea in the public imagination since Will Smith's Enemy of the State or Chris Nolan's first Batman movie -- creates the wave. This latest of many Patriot Act revelations merely fills it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Marshall McLuhan would have put it: The medium is the message. Remember that the next time you find yourself wondering why a particular story is trending for no good reason. In an always-on, socially driven media, the readiness is all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race War: The Obama administration spent thousands of federal dollars to help the Rev. Al Sharpton pressure the state of Florida to railroad George Zimmerman in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department not only met with Martin's parents and the notorious racial arsonist Sharpton, as we reported earlier this week. It even helped them organize rallies against Zimmerman, who trial evidence shows shot Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly released documents reveal the department spent more than $5,320 to send officials to Florida &quot;to work marches, demonstrations and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Washington-based Judicial Watch, a government watchdog group that uncovered the records through a Freedom of Information Act request, the department launched six separate deployments to Sanford, Fla., between March 25, 2012, and April 12, 2012, when officials got their way and Zimmerman was arrested for murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of one trip from March 30 to April 1, according to the expense report, was &quot;to provide support for protest.&quot; Sharpton was a featured speaker at the March 31 protest, dubbed &quot;The March for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; where he agitated for Zimmerman's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week earlier, Sharpton met with Martin's parents and escorted them to a meeting with justice officials in Florida. &quot;Earlier today, Trayvon's parents, attorney and I met with the Justice Department here,&quot; Sharpton bellowed on his MSNBC show &quot;Politics Nation.&quot; &quot;And later tonight, we rally for justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the scenes, Attorney General Eric Holder assured Sharpton that he would take &quot;swift action&quot; in the case to investigate whether local police had committed a &quot;civil rights crime&quot; in releasing Zimmerman from custody. Holder also deployed FBI agents to Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, Sanford's police chief was fired. Bill Lee now says he was axed due to &quot;political pressure&quot; and that &quot;outside forces&quot; hijacked the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just wanted an arrest&quot; to placate protesters threatening violence, Lee told CNN earlier this week, even though the evidence provided no probable cause to arrest Zimmerman. He said it was purely a matter of self defense, and he was right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as the case was taken away from Lee, evidence was leaked to the Martin family and Sharpton and his thugs. They got to hear the 911 tapes and coordinate their stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who leaked them? The same person who fired Lee -- Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte, a member of the National Forum for Black Public Administrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before he sacked the police chief, Bonaparte met in Washington with -- you guessed it -- Eric Holder. The attorney general had summoned both him and Sanford's mayor to discuss the allegedly &quot;unprovoked hate crime against a black teen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence is clear that Zimmerman was framed to look like a homicidal racist. It's also now clear there was a larger political orchestration behind the racial rabble-rousing, one that was led from the highest levels in Washington.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, instead of attacking a Hispanic senator, Marco Rubio, I will defend a Hispanic citizen, George Zimmerman, on trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's becoming painfully obvious why no charges were brought against Zimmerman in this case -- until Al Sharpton got involved. All the eyewitness accounts, testimony, ballistics and forensics keep backing up Zimmerman. We should send a big, fat bill for the whole thing to Sharpton, courtesy of MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the prosecution's witnesses making the defense's case, the inquisitors' last stand is to claim that, if the races were reversed, the black guy would have been instantly charged with murder. As explained in The New York Times: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Had Mr. Martin shot and killed Mr. Zimmerman under similar circumstances, black leaders say, the case would have barreled down a different path: Mr. Martin would have been quickly arrested by the Sanford Police Department and charged in the killing, without the benefit of the doubt.&quot; (Also, CNN could have dropped the &quot;white&quot; and referred to Zimmerman exclusively as &quot;Hispanic.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who say this are counting on the rest of us being too polite to mention that it is nearly impossible to imagine such a case in a world where half of all murders and a majority of robberies are committed by blacks. To reverse the races with the same set of facts, first, we're going to need a gated, mixed-race community, similar to the Retreat at Twin Lakes, that has recently experienced a rash of robberies by white guys. The only way to do that is to enter &quot;The Twilight Zone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were at least eight burglaries in the 14 months before Zimmerman's encounter with Martin. Numerous media accounts admit that &quot;most&quot; of these were committed by black males. I'm waiting to hear about a single crime at Twin Lakes that was not committed by a black male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just six months before Zimmerman's encounter with Martin, two men had broken into the home of a neighbor, Olivia Bertalan, while she was alone with her infant son. She had just enough time to call 911 before running upstairs and locking herself in a room. The burglars knew she was home, but proceeded to rob the place anyway, even trying to enter the locked room where she held her crying child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bertalan saw the burglars just before they broke into her house -- one at the front door and one at the back. They were young black males. They lived in the Retreat by Twin Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another case, a black teenager strode up to Zimmerman's house and, in broad daylight, stole a bicycle off the front porch. The bike was never recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks before Zimmerman saw Martin, he witnessed another young black male peering into the window of a neighbor's house. He called the cops, but by the time they arrived, the suspect was gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days later, another house was burglarized. The thieves made off with jewelry and a new laptop. Roofers working across the street had seen two black teenagers near the house at the time of the robbery. When they spotted one of the teens the next day, they called the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, the roofers followed the suspect so he wouldn't get away. The cops arrived and found the stolen laptop in his backpack. This was the same black teenager Zimmerman had seen looking in a neighbor's window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only reason it's hard to imagine the Zimmerman case with the races reversed is that it's hard to imagine a white teenager living in a mixed-race, middle-class community, mugging a black homeowner. This is not a problem of society's reactions, but of the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, at least one case of a black homeowner fatally shooting a white troublemaker. He was not charged with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, the ironically named John White was sound asleep at his nice Long Island home when his teenage son woke him to say there was a mob of white kids shouting epithets in front of the house. The family was in no imminent danger. They could have called 911 and remained safely behind locked doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But White grabbed a loaded Beretta and headed out to the end of the driveway to confront the mob. A scuffle ensued and White ended up shooting one of the kids in the face, killing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White was charged and convicted only of illegal weapons possession -- this was New York, after all -- and involuntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was sentenced to 20 months-to-four years in prison, but after serving five months was pardoned by Gov. David Paterson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all due compassion for the kid who was killed, the public was overwhelmingly on the father's side -- a fact still evident in Internet postings about the case. The kids were punks menacing a law-abiding homeowner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the prosecutor complained only that Paterson hadn't called the victim's family first. The local NAACP had campaigned aggressively on White's behalf. There were no threats to riot in case of an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centerpiece of White's self-defense argument was his recollection of his grandfather's stories about the Ku Klux Klan. George Zimmerman's memory of young black males committing crimes at Twin Lakes is somewhat more recent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White wasn't jumped, knocked to the ground, repeatedly punched, and his skull knocked against the ground. He wasn't even touched, though he claimed the white teen was lunging at him. Talk about no reason to &quot;follow,&quot; there was no reason for him to leave the safety of his locked home. White's son knew the kids by name. They could have waited for the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, yes, this case probably would be very different if Zimmerman's and Martin's races were reversed. It is only when the victim is black that we must have a show trial, a million-dollar reward paid to the victim's parents and the threat of riots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 12--Not since the trial of O.J. Simpson has a criminal case tinged with race riveted the country the way the George Zimmerman trial in Florida has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vernellia Randall, a local law expert in race relations, said the case fascinates people because it challenges views of what constitutes racism, particularly among people who strongly want to believe we have a color-blind society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have said race was involved in the delay in charging Zimmerman after he shot and killed an unarmed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, claiming self-defense. Others wonder why more attention has not been focused on Zimmerman's right to defend himself when allegedly threatened by Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict could come any day as jurors began deliberations Friday afternoon, and local residents have been paying close attention to what's happened inside that Orlando suburb courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could go both ways,&quot; Kristina Butler, of West Chester Twp., said of the verdict. &quot;I think it's a shame a young man was gunned down. I want to believe (Zimmerman), but there's too much racial prejudice in the world today, so I think the facts need to speak for themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall said Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was threatening because of his color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because he was a young black man walking in a place where he was perceived not to belong,&quot; she said, adding the same thing could happen to a white man in a predominately black neighborhood, as &quot;we get suspicious. Is that racism? I think it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the outcome would have been different, she said, if a black man had followed a white man because he found him suspicious, and the white man was shot to death. In that case, Randall said, it would be &quot;impossible to imagine&quot; that the black man wouldn't be arrested immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second degree murder. On the night of the scuffle in February 2012, Martin was visiting his father and his father's fiancee at the same townhouse complex where Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman observed Martin while driving in his neighborhood, called police and the fight ensued after the neighborhood watch volunteer got out of his vehicle. Zimmerman claims Martin was slamming his head into the concrete pavement when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though prosecutors said Zimmerman &quot;assumed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a criminal,&quot; Randall said that explanation leaves out why -- because Martin was black -- and that factor is what is driving public interest in the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of racial motivations is separate from the question of whether Zimmerman is guilty of murder, or as added Thursday, of manslaughter, Randall said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is what we're not discussing, and we're using this trial as a proxy for it,&quot; she said. &quot;And I think that's a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Amend, of Hamilton, said he believes the trial is definitely racially motivated and that the jury should find Zimmerman not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he was stupid, but it was self-defense,&quot; Amend said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other area residents said they haven't made up their minds about how the case should be decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were both in the wrong in the sense that, do I believe he should've been shot? No. But do I think Zimmerman was scared and used self-defense? Yes,&quot; said Madison Johnson, of Cincinnati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson said she believes if Zimmerman were black and Martin were white, this case would not be getting the same media attention, nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen Hart, a Xavier University psychology professor, said the news media is partly to blame for sensationalizing the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a cyclical thing. If it gets reported to us every night, people are going to comment or radio talk show hosts will bring it up, and of course, people will voice their opinions,&quot; Hart said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Judge Debra Nelson ruled that jurors can consider the lesser charge of manslaughter, as requested by prosecutors, and that was included in the jury instructions Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Hagel, a University of Dayton law professor, said the instruction allows for a &quot;compromise verdict,&quot; allowing the jury to go with another option if jurors find that prosecutors didn't make the case for murder, but don't want to let Zimmerman go completely free. He said jurors probably felt &quot;incredible pressure,&quot; given the national attention the case has garnered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whatever the decision jurors reach, most of those interviewed by this newspaper said there will be a public uproar. During the 44 days police waited to arrest Zimmerman, there were marches and protests around the country, including some in southwest Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be protests, people carrying signs and yelling in Florida because no matter what the verdict is, there are people who believe Trayvon was completely innocent and this is yet another indicator of continuing racism,&quot; Hart said. &quot;Then there are people on the other side who feel George Zimmerman is unfairly prosecuted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe the protests will turn violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will probably be riots,&quot; Amend said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are going to be upset,&quot;Johnson said. &quot;Either way, people will freak out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While security around the courthouse will most likely be heightened, many think that Zimmerman will need protection regardless of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If found innocent, he won't survive it,&quot; Butler said. &quot;I think he won't be safe no matter where he goes. He's not going to be safe if he goes to prison and he's not going to be safe if free and walking the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">811  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unmistakable setback for George Zimmerman, the jury at the neighborhood watch captain's second-degree murder trial was given the option Thursday of convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson issued her ruling over the objections of Zimmerman's lawyers shortly before a prosecutor delivered a closing argument in which he portrayed the defendant as an aspiring police officer who assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands. <BR>&quot;A teenager is dead. He is dead through no fault of his own,&quot; prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jurors. &quot;He is dead because a man made assumptions. ... Unfortunately because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks this Earth.&quot; <BR>Because of the judge's ruling, the six jurors will have three options when they start deliberations as early as Friday: guilty of second-degree murder, guilty of manslaughter and not guilty. <BR>Zimmerman attorney Don West had argued an all-or-nothing strategy, saying the only charge that should be put before the jury is second-degree murder. <BR>&quot;The state has charged him with second-degree murder. They should be required to prove it,&quot; West said. &quot;If they had wanted to charge him with manslaughter ... they could do that.&quot; <BR>To win a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors must prove Zimmerman showed ill will, hatred or spite - a burden the defense has argued the state failed to meet. To get a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification. <BR>Allowing the jurors to consider manslaughter could give those who aren't convinced the shooting amounted to murder a way to hold Zimmerman responsible for the death of the unarmed teen, said David Hill, an Orlando defense attorney with no connection to the case. <BR>&quot;From the jury's point of view, if they don't like the second-degree murder - and I can see why they don't like it - he doesn't want to give them any options to convict on lesser charges,&quot; Hill said of the defense attorney. <BR>Because of the way Florida law imposes longer sentences for crimes committed with a gun, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second-degree murder: life in prison. <BR>It is standard for prosecutors in Florida murder cases to ask that the jury be allowed to consider lesser charges that were not actually brought against the defendant. And it is not unusual for judges to grant such requests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor Richard Mantei also asked that the jury be allowed to consider third-degree murder, on the premise that Zimmerman committed child abuse when he shot the underage Martin. Zimmerman's lawyer called that &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;outrageous,&quot; and the judge sided with the defense. <BR>Zimmerman, 29, got into a scuffle with Martin after spotting the teen while driving through his gated townhouse complex on a rainy night in February 2012. Zimmerman has claimed he fired in self-defense after Martin sucker-punched him and began slamming his head into the pavement. Prosecutors have disputed his account and portrayed him as the aggressor. <BR>During closing arguments, de la Rionda argued that Zimmerman showed ill will and hatred when he whispered profanities to a police dispatcher over his cellphone while following Martin through the neighborhood. He said Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; the teenager as a criminal. <BR>&quot;He assumed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a criminal,&quot; de la Rionda said. &quot;That is why we are here.&quot; <BR>The prosecutor told the jury that Zimmerman wanted to be a police officer and that's why he followed Martin. But &quot;the law doesn't allow people to take the law into their own hands,&quot; de la Rionda said. <BR>De la Rionda's two-hour presentation also included moments when he seemed to appeal to jurors' emotions by showing a head shot from Martin's autopsy and a face-up crime scene photo of Martin. Several jurors looked away. <BR>The prosecutor also repeatedly asked why Zimmerman left his truck the night of the shooting. <BR>&quot;Why does this defendant get out of his car if he thought Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is a threat to him?&quot; de la Rionda asked. &quot;Why? Because he had a gun.&quot; <BR>Later, when he straddled a foam mannequin to dispute Zimmerman's account of how the struggle unfolded, the entire back row of jurors stood. One juror even stepped down to get a better view. <BR>De la Rionda implored jurors to believe the account of Martin's friend Rachel Jeantel, who was on the phone with him moments before the shooting and said she heard him yelling, &quot;Get off!&quot; The prosecutor asked jurors to discount her &quot;colorful language,&quot; and he put a twist on a quote by the Rev. Martin Luther King to persuade them. <BR>&quot;She should be judged not by the color of her personality but by the content of her testimony,&quot; de la Rionda said. <BR>Zimmerman's lawyers are expected to deliver their closing arguments Friday morning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early hours of Jan. 1, 2009, Oscar Grant III, unarmed and lying face down on a subway platform in Oakland, Calif., was shot in the back by a white Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer. The incident, captured on video by onlookers, incited protest, unrest and arguments similar to those that would swirl around the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida a few years later. The deaths of these and other African-American young men (Mr. Grant was 22) touch some of the rawest nerves in the body politic and raise thorny and apparently intractable issues of law and order, violence and race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those matters are hardly absent from ''Fruitvale Station,'' Ryan Coogler's powerful and sensitive debut feature, which imaginatively reconstructs the last 24 or so hours of Oscar Grant's life, flashing back from a horrifying snippet of actual cellphone video of the hectic moments before the shooting. But Mr. Coogler, a 27-year-old Bay Area native who went to film school at the University of Southern California, examines his subject with a steady, objective eye and tells his story in the key of wise heartbreak rather than blind rage. It is not that the movie is apolitical or disengaged from the painful, public implications of Mr. Grant's fate. But everything it has to say about class, masculinity and the tricky relations among different kinds of people in a proudly diverse and liberal metropolis is embedded in details of character and place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As played by Michael B. Jordan (Vince Howard to devotees of ''Friday Night Lights,'' though to fans of ''The Wire,'' he will always be Wallace), Oscar is a case study in confusion, unsure of where he's going and a source of worry to those who love him. He dotes on his daughter, Tatiana, and seems sincere in his desire -- if not entirely steady in his resolve -- to stay with her mother, Sophina (Melonie Diaz). His own mother, Wanda (Octavia Spencer), is still able to boss him around, and he spends a lot of the day shopping for her birthday party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a natural, easy sweetness to Oscar, but neither Mr. Coogler's script nor Mr. Jordan's performance sugarcoats his temperament. He is, for one thing, irresponsible and not always honest, unable to admit to Sophina or Wanda that he has been fired from his supermarket job for chronic lateness. Even after two stints in prison (one visited in the film's only chronological digression), he is still selling drugs, and his vows to stop have the feel of New Year's resolutions, inspiring more hope than confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few moments lean a bit too hard on our dread-filled foreknowledge of Oscar's tragic end. The lost dog he encounters at a gas station might as well have ''Metaphor'' stamped on its collar. But Mr. Coogler, with a ground-level, hand-held shooting style that sometimes evokes the spiritually alert naturalism of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, has enough faith in his actors and in the intrinsic interest of the characters' lives to keep overt sentimentality and messagemongering to a minimum. You get the sense that he might have made this movie even if the world had not handed him a terrible true story, and made any day in the life of Oscar Grant into a sad, touching and subtle film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, in truth, Mr. Coogler has made that movie, even as he has also made one full of anger, grief and frustration. His main intention -- and his great achievement, as well as Mr. Jordan's -- is to make Oscar a fully human presence, to pay him the respect of acknowledging his complexities and contradictions. The radicalism of ''Fruitvale Station'' lies precisely here, in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol. Nearly every black man, whether or not he is president, tends to be flattened out by popular culture and the psychopathology of everyday American life, rendered as an innocent victim, a noble warrior or a menace to society. There is a dehumanizing violence in this habit, a willed, toxic blindness that ''Fruitvale Station'' at once exposes and resists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other characters, the social environment they navigate and the language they speak are treated with a similarly nuanced attention. Sophina and Wanda have their own burdens and distractions, and they deal with Oscar's shortcomings as well as they can. The streets of Hayward, Oakland and San Francisco and the cars of the BART trains are places of happy chaos and spontaneous solidarity, but also contested spaces where violence often seems close at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as it unfolds with a terrible sense of inevitability, ''Fruitvale Station'' is rarely predictable. The climactic encounter with BART police officers erupts in a mood of vertiginous uncertainty, defusing facile or inflammatory judgments and bending the audience's reflexive emotional horror and moral outrage toward a necessary and difficult ethical inquiry. How could this have happened? How did we -- meaning any one of us who might see faces like our own depicted on that screen -- allow it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Fruitvale Station'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Profanity, violence and other facts of life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was Trayvon Martin aggressive and paranoid from smoking marijuana, and did that lead him to attack George Zimmerman? That's what lawyers for Mr. Zimmerman are arguing. He is on trial for killing Mr. Martin, but claims he acted in self-defense, and the judge in the racially charged, nationally followed case decided earlier this week that the jury could be presented with Mr. Martin's toxicology report, which shows that he had marijuana in his system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a neuropsychopharmacologist who has spent 15 years studying the neurophysiological, psychological and behavioral effects of marijuana, I find this line of reasoning laughable. The toxicology exam, which was conducted the morning after Mr. Martin was killed, found a mere 1.5 nanograms per milliliter of blood of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, in his body. This strongly suggests he had not ingested marijuana for at least 24 hours. This is also far below the THC levels that I have found necessary, in my experimental research on dozens of subjects, to induce intoxication: between 40 and 400 nanograms per milliliter. In fact, his THC levels were significantly lower than the sober, baseline levels of about 14 nanograms per milliliter of many of my patients, who are daily users. Mr. Martin could not have been intoxicated with marijuana at the time of the shooting; the amount of THC found in his system was too low for it to have had any meaningful effect on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some observers of the case note that the toxicology test also found 7.3 nanograms per milliliter of THC-COOH, one of the main metabolic byproducts formed as the liver breaks down THC. But these metabolites of marijuana have no psychoactive properties, and they have no effect on behavior. They can also remain in the body, like THC itself, for up to four weeks. This is why their presence does not reveal when -- or exactly how much of -- the drug was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For argument's sake, though, suppose that the tiny amount of THC found in Mr. Martin's blood somehow managed to mildly intoxicate him that night. The scientific studies, including my own research, on the short-term effects of the drug on cognitive functioning show how unlikely it is that marijuana could have caused him to behave erratically or have difficulty following instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, the drug can temporarily slow people down in completing familiar tasks that involve memory or abstract reasoning, and it can lower a person's level of vigilance or focus. But research subjects in my studies have shown that they can make plans, exhibit self-control and cooperate closely with others even under heavy influence of marijuana -- never mind when only slightly affected, as Mr. Martin could, at most, have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a broader point to be made, though. Regardless of how intoxicated Mr. Martin was, the research tells us that aggression and violence are highly unlikely outcomes of marijuana use. Based on my own work, during which I have administered thousands of doses of marijuana, I can say that its main effects are contentment, relaxation, sedation, euphoria and increased hunger, all peaking within 5 to 10 minutes after smoking and lasting for about two hours. It is true that very high THC concentrations -- far beyond Mr. Martin's levels -- can cause mild hallucinations and paranoia, but even these effects are rare and usually seen only in very inexperienced users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, it is marijuana withdrawal that can increase aggression. But it, too, is rare and is mainly seen after abrupt cessation of heavy, almost daily use of the drug. We have seen no evidence to suggest that Mr. Martin was this kind of user, making it unlikely that marijuana withdrawal could have made him act aggressively toward Mr. Zimmerman. Remember, too, that Mr. Martin calmly purchased iced tea and candy from a 7-Eleven store shortly before his encounter with Mr. Zimmerman, which contradicts the notion that he was uncontrollably aggressive or at all paranoid at the time, whether from marijuana use, withdrawal or anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a time, back in the 1930s, when scientific data on marijuana was thin on the ground. This left us vulnerable to exaggerated anecdotal accounts of its harms, especially its supposed tendency to induce aggression or even insanity. Newspapers and magazines routinely ran stories drawing a connection between marijuana use and heinous crimes, and some people even claimed it was a cause of matricide. These fables contributed to its de facto criminalization in 1937, through the Marijuana Tax Act. During Congressional hearings that year concerning the act, Harry J. Anslinger, commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (predecessor of the Drug Enforcement Administration) declared, ''Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven decades and hundreds of studies later, we no longer have an excuse for indulging the myth of ''reefer madness.'' It has no place in our courts -- which means Mr. Martin's toxicology report doesn't, either.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- In a murder case of chain reactions, the chief prosecutor, Bernie de la Rionda, began with the very first link when he delivered his closing statement on Thursday in the George Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed black teenager carrying nothing but snacks, died of a gunshot to the heart for one reason, he said: Mr. Zimmerman saw himself as a cop and Mr. Martin as a hoodie-clad criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He went over the line,'' Mr. de la Rionda told the jury. ''He assumed things that weren't true and, instead of waiting for the police to come and do their job, he did not. He, the defendant, wanted to make sure that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin didn't get out of the neighborhood.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''In this defendant's mind he automatically assumed that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a criminal,'' Mr. de la Rionda added. ''And that's why we're here.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he shot Mr. Martin in self-defense, is charged with second-degree murder in the Feb. 26, 2012, death of Mr. Martin, who was 17. If convicted, he could face life in prison. On Thursday, the judge, Debra S. Nelson, said the jury would also be able to consider manslaughter as a lesser charge. This charge is typically included in Florida murder cases if either side requests it. Manslaughter with a firearm carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the defense will present its closing statement, followed by a one-hour rebuttal by the prosecution. The case will then go to the sequestered jury of six women for deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting, and the six-week delay in Mr. Zimmerman's arrest, provoked outrage from blacks here and elsewhere as civil rights leaders denounced what they viewed as a justice system historically uncaring of the rights of African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his two-hour closing statement in the Seminole County courthouse, Mr. de la Rionda wielded Mr. Zimmerman's own words, parsing his statements to the police for discrepancies and inconsistencies. Over and over, he played recordings of Mr. Zimmerman's account for the jury, stopping to point out what he called exaggerations and lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In those statements, Mr. Zimmerman said that Mr. Martin knocked him to the ground, punched him and slammed his head repeatedly against the pavement. Fearing for his life, afraid that Mr. Martin was reaching for his gun, he shot him. He had a permit to carry a concealed handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But prosecutors said that Mr. Zimmerman profiled Mr. Martin as he was headed home in the rain to the house where he was a guest. Mr. Zimmerman got out of the car with a gun concealed in his waistband and chased him so he would not get away. He was the aggressor in the fight, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contradictions in Mr. Zimmerman's story abound, they said, citing these assertions from the defendant:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How could Mr. Martin have grabbed for the gun and not left DNA on it? How could he have even seen that tiny gun in Mr. Zimmerman's waistband in the dark? Why would Mr. Zimmerman get out of the car and follow Mr. Martin if he was scared of him? How could Mr. Martin have been punching Mr. Zimmerman, covering his mouth and reaching for his gun at the same time? And wouldn't Mr. Zimmerman have suffered more grievous wounds to his head if Mr. Martin had slammed it against the pavement 25 times?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Is he exaggerating what happened?'' asked Mr. de la Rionda, calling the statements lies, a ploy to pad his self-defense case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in raising so many questions instead of answering them with evidence, Mr. de la Rionda also underscored weaknesses in his own case. There were no eyewitnesses to the shooting, and only one person is alive to tell the story. Dozens of witnesses have testified over the course of the three-week trial, but it is still unclear what happened in the moments leading up to the fight and during the struggle itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors have a tough burden: they must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Zimmerman did not shoot in self-defense. Florida has generous self-defense laws that give the benefit of the doubt to a gunman who has a reasonable person's fear of great bodily harm or imminent death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second-degree murder is also a high hurdle. Prosecutors must show that Mr. Zimmerman murdered Mr. Martin that night with a ''depraved mind'' -- one that harbored ill will, hatred or spite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why Mr. de la Rionda pounced on Mr. Zimmerman's remarks about Mr. Martin -- just another criminal coming to burglarize a neighborhood that had been stung by a string of burglaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Punks,'' Mr. Zimmerman muttered to a police dispatcher after he spotted Mr. Martin, using a profanity as well. Later, using another derogatory word to refer to would-be burglars, he said, ''They always get away.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The defense may say, 'Oh, he was just angry,' '' Mr. de la Rionda said. ''Well, you decide. I would decide that's more than a little angry. That's frustration, ill will, hatred. You've made up your mind it's a criminal, and you're tired of criminals.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de la Rionda emphasized another point: In his interviews with the police, Mr. Zimmerman took pains to avoid saying he followed Mr. Martin. He knew, Mr. de la Rionda said, that that would complicate his self-defense claim. Instead, Mr. Zimmerman said he got out of the car to give the police the correct address and walked in Mr. Martin's direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his presentation, Mr. de la Rionda mocked Mr. Zimmerman as a ''wannabe cop'' who knew the law and used police jargon like ''suspect'' and ''torso'' to ingratiate himself with the police. He sprinkled in the suggestion that Mr. Zimmerman was so scared that he might have walked around in the dark with his gun drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After playing a clip of Mr. Zimmerman's television interview with Sean Hannity in which Mr. Zimmerman said that Mr. Martin did not run but was ''skipping'' away, Mr. de la Rionda began to skip around the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Use your God-given common sense,'' Mr. de la Rionda said to the jury several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gray foam dummy that both sides had straddled the previous day to depict the struggle made a second appearance. Some jurors stood up to watch as Mr. de la Rionda jumped on the dummy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. de la Rionda also treaded lightly over witness testimony, mentioning that different people gave differing accounts of who was on top during the struggle. He spoke more in detail of Rachel Jeantel's testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Jeantel, 19, a friend of Mr. Martin's who spoke to him on the phone moments before he was shot, had a difficult time on the stand. She was clearly uncomfortable, her speech was often indistinct and she acknowledged that, among other things, she had lied previously about her age and why she did not attend Mr. Martin's wake. Her testimony could be crucial because she said Mr. Martin told her that he was being followed by a ''creepy-ass cracker'' and that he was afraid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Her use of colorful language doesn't mean her testimony is less credible just because she's not a highly educated individual,'' Mr. de la Rionda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the end, Mr. de la Rionda hammered away at the chain of events Mr. Zimmerman set off, he said, when he profiled Mr. Martin, got out of his car with a gun and followed him, despite the advice of the police dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The law doesn't allow people to take the law into their own hands,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, a gun on his hip, made the wrong assumptions and the wrong choices, he said. Because of that, a teenager who was ''minding his own business,'' heading to watch a basketball game, wound up dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The law talks about accountability and responsibility for one's actions, and that's what we're asking for in this case,'' he said. ''Hold the defendant responsible for his actions; hold him accountable for what he did. Because if the defendant hadn't assumed that -- then Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would have watched the basketball game, George Zimmerman would have gone to Target or done whatever he does on Sunday evenings, and we wouldn't be here.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) Police and city leaders in Florida say are preparing for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if a neighborhood watch volunteer is acquitted in the killing of an unarmed black teen a case that has already provoked protests after police initially refused to arrest the defendant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, was visiting his father and father&quot;s fiancee when George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, fatally shot him during a physical confrontation in a gated community in February 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin&quot;s supporters portrayed the shooting as racially motivated, while Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, claimed self-defense. Charged with second-degree murder, Zimmerman is pleading not guilty at the trial unfolding in a Sanford courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After police failed to charge Zimmerman for 44 days, there were many large but peaceful protests in Florida as well as in New York and other cities. Those demonstrations included a mass walkout at nearly three dozen Florida high schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, Florida officials have been working with pastors, youth coaches, community activists and summer camp counselors to stress a non-violent approach if Zimmerman walks free. At the same time, police say they have quietly been making plans for dealing with any potential emotional flare-ups that could quickly turn into storefront-smashing, car-burning riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It&quot;s all right to be vocal, but we don&quot;t want to be violent,&quot; said the Rev. Walter T. Richardson, a longtime pastor and chairman of Miami-Dade County&quot;s Community Relations Board, which has been holding town hall-style meetings about the case. &quot;We&quot;ve already lost one soul and we don&quot;t want to lose any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in Sanford say they doubt the trial&quot;s outcome would spark local residents to take to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main focus was to get Zimmerman arrested and have him tried before a jury of his peers in a court of law,&quot; said Clayton Turner Jr., president of the Seminole County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. &quot;That was the main issue, not how we felt about whether he&quot;s innocent or guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone is so certain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shantree Hall, 37, who is black, said a Zimmerman acquittal might anger many in the African-American community who already feel they are less likely to obtain justice. The protests that led to Zimmerman&quot;s arrest taught many people that was the only way to get things done, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Trayvon, the noise was too loud for them. That&quot;s why they couldn&quot;t sweep it under the rug,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent Miami-area high school graduate Jude Bruno, 18, said he doesn&quot;t sense from friends and peers that there is a powder keg waiting to explode should Zimmerman be found not guilty. Bruno is chairman of the Miami-Dade County Youth Commission, which has been working with local youth groups to stress a peaceful reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to be the example to the world because the whole world is watching us,&quot; Bruno said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruno spoke after a Community Relations Board meeting this week that drew several hundred people to a Miami Gardens library auditorium, some of them wearing &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; T-shirts and many asking sharp-edged questions about the trial. Still, the overall theme was peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please, no violence. We don&quot;t want any violence. None,&quot; said Miriam Martin, one of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;s aunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One potential advantage mentioned by several law enforcement officials: school is out for summer, meaning there is no ready-made rallying point for young people to gather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, authorities are taking no chances, particularly in the Miami area which has had riots in the past connected to racially-charged court cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst rioting occurred in 1980 in the mostly-black Liberty City and Overtown neighborhoods of Miami, after four white police officers were acquitted in the death of Arthur McDuffie, a black Marine Corps veteran. McDuffie was beaten to death by police trying to stop him for a traffic violation. The three-day riot killed 18 people and did some $100 million in damage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, saying he fired in self-defense during a nighttime confrontation in February 2012 in his Florida gated community, where Martin was visiting family. Zimmerman says Martin was slamming his head into the concrete pavement when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors could begin deliberating as early as Friday. The defense was expected to give closing arguments Friday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case drew national attention and protests when Zimmerman, 29, wasn&quot;t arrested for weeks after the shooting, and racial tensions have been exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors have portrayed Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, as an aspiring police officer who assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As their closing arguments continued Thursday, police and city leaders in Florida said they have prepared for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if Zimmerman is acquitted, particularly in African-American neighborhoods where passions run strongest over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It&quot;s all right to be vocal, but we don&quot;t want to be violent,&quot; said the Rev. Walter T. Richardson, a longtime pastor and chairman of Miami-Dade County&quot;s Community Relations Board. &quot;We&quot;ve already lost one soul and we don&quot;t want to lose any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is especially sensitive in Miami, where deadly rioting occurred in 1980 in mostly-black neighborhoods after four white police officers were acquitted in the beating death of a black Marine Corps veteran during a stop for a traffic violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Miami-Dade Police Department&quot;s intelligence operation has been combing social media to monitor signs of unusual interest in Zimmerman&quot;s trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge has ruled that jurors can consider a lesser charge of manslaughter for Zimmerman. But because of the way Florida law imposes longer sentences for crimes committed with a gun, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as heavy as the one for second-degree murder: life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutors must prove Zimmerman showed ill will, hatred or spite a burden the defense has argued the state failed to meet. To get a manslaughter conviction, prosecutors must show only that Zimmerman killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told jurors that Zimmerman wanted to be a police officer and that&quot;s why he followed Martin through his neighborhood, even though the teen wasn&quot;t doing anything wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He assumed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a criminal. That is why we are here,&quot; de la Rionda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda argued that Zimmerman showed ill will and hatred when he whispered profanities to a police dispatcher over his cellphone while following Martin through the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instructions read to jury by The Honorable Debra S. Nelson, Circuit Judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CIRCUIT JUDGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Jury, I thank you for your attention during this trial. Please pay attention to the instructions I am about to give you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATEMENT OF CHARGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the defendant in this case, has been accused of the crime of Second Degree Murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTRODUCTION TO HOMICIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this case, George Zimmerman is accused of Second Degree Murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A killing that is excusable or was committed by the use of justifiable deadly force is lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you find Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed by George Zimmerman, you will then consider the circumstances surrounding the killing in deciding if the killing was Murder in the Second Degree or was Manslaughter, or whether the killing was excusable or resulted from justifiable use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of a human being is justifiable and lawful if necessarily done while resisting an attempt to murder or commit a felony upon George Zimmerman, or to commit a felony in any dwelling house in which George Zimmerman was at the time of the attempted killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXCUSABLE HOMICIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of a human being is excusable, and therefore lawful, under any one of the three following circumstances:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When the killing is committed by accident and misfortune in doing any lawful act by lawful means with usual ordinary caution and without any unlawful intent, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the killing occurs by accident and misfortune in the heat of passion, upon any sudden and sufficient provocation, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When the killing is committed by accident and misfortune resulting from a sudden combat, if a dangerous weapon is not used and the attempted killing is not done in a cruel and unusual manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dangerous weapon&quot; is any weapon that, taking into account the manner in which it is used, is likely to produce death or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I now instruct you on the circumstances that must be proved before George Zimmerman may be found guilty of Second Degree Murder or any lesser crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECOND DEGREE MURDER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prove the crime of Second Degree Murder, the State must prove the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The death was caused by the criminal act of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There was an unlawful killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by an act imminently dangerous to another and demonstrating a depraved mind without regard for human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An &quot;act&quot; includes a series of related actions arising from and performed pursuant to a single design or purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An act is &quot;imminently dangerous to another and demonstrating a depraved mind&quot; if it is an act or series of acts that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. a person of ordinary judgment would know is reasonably certain to kill or do serious bodily injury to another, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. is done from ill will, hatred, spite or an evil intent, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. is of such a nature that the act itself indicates an indifference to human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to convict of Second Degree Murder, it is not necessary for the State to prove George Zimmerman had an intent to cause death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POSSESSION OF A FIREARM AND DISCHARGE CAUSING DEATH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you find that George Zimmerman committed Second Degree Murder and you also find beyond a reasonable doubt that during the commission of the crime, he discharged a firearm, and in doing so, caused great bodily harm to, or the death of, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, you should find George Zimmerman guilty of Second Degree Murder with discharge of a firearm causing great</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bodily harm or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you find that George Zimmerman committed Second Degree Murder, and you also find beyond a reasonable doubt that during the commission of the crime, he discharged a firearm, you should find George Zimmerman guilty of Second Degree Murder with discharge of a firearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you find that George Zimmerman committed Second Degree Murder and you also find beyond a reasonable doubt that during the commission of the crime, he actually possessed a firearm, you should find George Zimmerman guilty of Second Degree Murder with actual possession of a firearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;firearm&quot; is legally defined as any weapon which will, is designed to, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To &quot;actually possess&quot; a firearm means that George Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) carried a firearm on his person; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) had a firearm within immediate physical reach with ready access with the intent to use the firearm during the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN THERE ARE LESSER INCLUDED CRIMES OR ATTEMPTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In considering the evidence, you should consider the possibility that although the evidence may not convince you that George Zimmerman committed the main crime of which he is accused, there may be evidence that he committed other acts that would constitute a lesser included crime. Therefore, if you decide that the main accusation has not been proved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beyond a reasonable doubt, you will next need to decide if George Zimmerman is guilty of any lesser included crime. The lesser crime indicated in the definition of Second Degree Murder is:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manslaughter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of a human being is justifiable and lawful if necessarily done while resisting an attempt to murder or commit a felony upon George Zimmerman, or to commit a felony in any dwelling house in which George Zimmerman was at the time of the attempted killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXCUSABLE HOMICIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of a human being is excusable, and therefore lawful, under any one of the three following circumstances:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When the killing is committed by accident and misfortune in doing any lawful act by lawful means with usual ordinary caution and without any unlawful intent, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the killing occurs by accident and misfortune in the heat of passion, upon any sudden and sufficient provocation, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When the killing is committed by accident and misfortune resulting from a sudden combat, if a dangerous weapon is not used and the attempted killing is not done in a cruel and unusual manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dangerous weapon&quot; is any weapon that, taking into account the manner in which it is used, is likely to produce death or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANSLAUGHTER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prove the crime of Manslaughter, the State must prove the following two elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. George Zimmerman intentionally committed an act or acts that caused the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman cannot be guilty of manslaughter by committing a merely negligent act or if the killing was either justifiable or excusable homicide: Each of us has a duty to act reasonably toward others. If there is a violation of that duty, without any conscious intention to harm, that violation is negligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of a human being is justifiable homicide and lawful if necessarily done while resisting an attempt to murder or commit a felony upon George Zimmerman, or to commit a felony in any dwelling house in which George Zimmerman was at the time of the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing of a human being is excusable, and therefore lawful, under any one of the following three circumstances:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When the killing is committed by accident and misfortune in doing any lawful act by lawful means with usual ordinary caution and without any unlawful intent, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the killing occurs by accident and misfortune in the heat of passion, upon any sudden and sufficient provocation, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When the killing is committed by accident and misfortune resulting from a sudden combat, if a dangerous weapon is not used and the killing is not done in a cruel or unusual manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to convict of manslaughter by act, it is not necessary for the State to prove that George Zimmerman had an intent to cause death, only an intent to commit an act that was not merely negligent, justified, or excusable and which caused death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you find George Zimmerman committed Manslaughter, and you also find beyond a reasonable doubt that during the commission of the Manslaughter, George Zimmerman carried, displayed, used, threatened to use, or attempted to use a firearm, you should check the appropriate box on the verdict form which I will discuss with you later in these instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The definition of a firearm has been previously provided in these instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUSTIFIABLE USE OF DEADLY FORCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An issue in this case is whether George Zimmerman acted in self- defense. It is a defense to the crime of Second Degree Murder, and the lesser included offense of Manslaughter, if the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin resulted from the justifiable use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Deadly force&quot; means force likely to cause death or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person is justified in using deadly force if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In deciding whether George Zimmerman was justified in the use of deadly force, you must judge him by the circumstances by which he was surrounded at the time the force was used. The danger facing George Zimmerman need not have been actual; however, to justify the use of deadly force, the appearance of danger must have been so real that a reasonably cautious and prudent person under the same circumstances would have believed that the danger could be avoided only through the use of that force. Based upon appearances, George Zimmerman must have actually believed that the danger was real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In considering the issue of self-defense, you may take into account the relative physical abilities and capacities of George Zimmerman and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If in your consideration of the issue of self -defense you have a reasonable doubt on the question of whether George Zimmerman was justified in the use of deadly force, you should find George Zimmerman not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if from the evidence you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that George Zimmerman was not justified in the use of deadly force, you should find him guilty if all the elements of the charge have been proved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PLEA OF NOT GUILTY; REASONABLE DOUBT; AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman has entered a plea of not guilty. This means you must presume or believe George Zimmerman is innocent. The presumption stays with George Zimmerman as to each material allegation in the Information through each stage of the trial unless it has been overcome by the evidence to the exclusion of and beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To overcome George Zimmerman's presumption of innocence, the State has the burden of proving the crime with which George Zimmerman is charged was committed and George Zimmerman is the person who committed the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman is not required to present evidence or prove anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever the words &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; are used you must consider the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt, a speculative, imaginary or forced doubt. Such a doubt must not influence you to return a verdict of not guilty if you have an abiding conviction of guilt. On the other hand if, after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, there is not an abiding conviction of guilt, or, if having a conviction, it is one which is not stable but one which wavers and vacillates, th en the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt and you must find George Zimmerman not guilty because the doubt is reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is to the evidence introduced in this trial, and to it alone, that you are to look for that proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reasonable doubt as to the guilt of George Zimmerman may arise from the evidence, conflict in the evidence, or the lack of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have a reasonable doubt, you should find George Zimmerman not guilty. If you have no reasonable doubt, you should find George Zimmerman guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DATE OF CRIME</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State must prove that the crime was committed on February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VENUE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It must be proved, only to a reasonable certainty, that the alleged crime was committed in Seminole County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is up to you to decide what evidence is reliable. You should use your common sense in deciding which is the best evidence, and which evidence should not be relied upon in considering your verdict. You may find some of the evidence not reliable, or less reliable than other evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You should consider how the witnesses acted, as well as what they said. Some things you should consider are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Did the witness seem to have an opportunity to see and know the things about which the witness testified?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Did the witness seem to have an accurate memory?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Was the witness honest and straightforward in answering the attorneys' questions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Did the witness have some interest in how the case should be decided?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Does the witness' s testimony agree with the other testimony and other evidence in the case?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Did the witness at some other time make a statement that is inconsistent with the testimony he or she gave in court?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is entirely proper for a lawyer to talk to a witness about what testimony the witness would give if called to the courtroom. The witness should not be discredited by talking to a lawyer about his or her testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may rely upon your own conclusion about the witness. A juror may believe or disbelieve all or any part of the evidence or the testimony of any witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXPERT WITNESSES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expert witnesses are like other witnesses, with one exception - the law permits an expert witness to give his or her opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, an expert's opinion is only reliable when given on a subject about which you believe him or her to be an expert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other witnesses, you may believe or disbelieve all or any part of an expert's testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE ZIMMERMAN NOT TESTIFYING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution requires the State to prove its accusations against George Zimmerman. It is not necessary for George Zimmerman to disprove anything. Nor is George Zimmerman required to prove his innocence. It is up to the State to prove George Zimmerman's guilt by evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman exercised a fundamental right by choosing not to be a witness in this case. You must not view this as an admission of guilt or be influenced in any way by his decision. No juror should ever be concerned that George Zimmerman did or did not take the witness stand to give testimony in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S STATEMENTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement claimed to have been made by George Zimmerman outside of court has been placed before you. Such a statement should always be considered with caution and be weighed with great care to make certain it was freely and voluntarily made. Therefore, you must determine from the evidence that George Zimmerman's alleged statement was knowingly, voluntarily and freely made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In making this determination, you should consider the total circumstances, including but not limited to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. whether, when George Zimmerman made the statement, he had been threatened in order to get him to make it, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. whether anyone had promised him anything in order to get him to make it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you conclude George Zimmerman's out of court statement was not freely and voluntarily made, you should disregard it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RULES FOR DELIBERATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are some general rules that apply to your discussion. You must follow these rules in order to return a lawful verdict:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. You must follow the law as it is set out in these instructions. If you fail to follow the law, your verdict will be a miscarriage of justice. There is no reason for failing to follow the law in this case. All of us are depending upon you to make a wise and legal decision in this matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. This case must be decided only upon the evidence that you have heard from the testimony of the witnesses and have seen in the form of the exhibits in evidence and these instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. This case must not be decided for or against anyone because you feel sorry for anyone, or are angry at anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Remember, the lawyers are not on trial. Your feelings about them should not influence your decision in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Your duty is to determine if George Zimmerman has been proven guilty or not, in accord with the law. It is the Judge's job to determine a proper sentence if George Zimmerman is found guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Whatever verdict you render must be unanimous, that is, each juror must agree to the same verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Your verdict should not be influenced by feelings of prejudice, bias or sympathy. Your verdict must be based on the evidence, and on the law contained in these instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOTES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this trial, I have permitted you to take notes. You will be allowed to take those notes into the jury room during deliberations. You are instructed that your notes are a tool to aid your individual memory. You should not compare your notes with those of other jurors in determining the content of any testimony or in evaluating the importance of any evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notes are for the note taker's personal use in refreshing his or her recollection of the evidence. They are not evidence. Above all, your memory should be your greatest asset in your recollection of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAUTIONARY INSTRUCTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deciding a verdict is exclusively your job. I cannot participate in that decision in any way. Please disregard anything I may have said or done that made you think I preferred one verdict over another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VERDICT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may find George Zimmerman guilty as charged in the Information or guilty of such lesser included crime as the evidence may justify or not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you return a verdict of guilty, it should be for the highest offense which has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If you find that no offense has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then, of course, your verdict must be not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only one verdict may be returned as to the crime charged. This verdict must be unanimous, that is all of you must agree to the same verdict. The verdict must be in writing and for your convenience the necessary forms of verdict have been prepared for you. They are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUBMITTING THE CASE TO THE JURY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In just a few moments you will be taken to the jury room by the bailiff. The first thing you should do is choose a foreperson who will preside over your deliberations. The foreperson should see to it that your discussions are carried on in an organized way and that everyone has a fair chance to be heard. It is also the foreperson's job to sign and date the verdict form when all of you have agreed on a verdict, and to bring the verdict form back to the courtroom when you return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During deliberations, jurors must communicate about the case only with one another and only when all jurors are present in the jury room. You are not to communicate with any person outside the jury about this case. Until you have reached a verdict, you must not talk about this case in person or through the telephone, writing, or electronic communication, such as a blog, twitter, e-mail, text message, or any other means. Do not contact anyone to assist you during deliberations. These communications rules apply until I discharge you at theof the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. L. Ronald Durham, president of the Daytona Beach Black Clergy Alliance, said he and several other pastors will go to Sanford on Saturday morning to await the verdict and support Trayvon Martin's family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt it was important to show the family our support for what they've gone through and what they've had to endure over the last year,&quot; said Durham, senior pastor of the Greater Friendship Baptist Church. &quot;It is certainly our hope that the outcome will be one that demonstrates that there was a righteous outcome to this terrible tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham said the Rev. Al Sharpton also plans on going to Sanford once the verdict is reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has been part of the support for the family since the incident first happened over a year ago, and he promised then, to the family, that he would stay with this case until there was a resolution,&quot; said Durham, who's also vice president of the Florida Baptist Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham said he and other pastors in the Black Clergy Alliance have asked their church members for calm no matter what verdict the jury reaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other local leaders also have asked for peace in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're asking for calm, and we've always asked for calm,&quot; Volusia County-Daytona Beach NAACP President Cynthia Slater said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slater said she is more concerned about the potential reaction from Zimmerman's supporters if he is found guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who's asking them what's going to happen if the verdict is not in their favor or not what they expect?&quot; Slater said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volusia County Sheriff's Office spokesman Brandon Haught said the Sheriff's Office has been in contact with local law enforcement near the trial and is ready to assist if the situation warrants their involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham added that everyone needs to let the justice system decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my hope that this family, that both families, can come through whatever the decision the jury makes recognizing that the justice system that we have is the best in the world,&quot; Durham said. &quot;And whatever the outcome may be, we are calling for everyone to remain level-headed, calm and recognize that the court system is the way everyone wanted this to end, that the decision not be made by anyone but our judicial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weather: Clearing. We'll get a brief chance to dry out today, as sunny skies with no chance of rain are forecast with highs in the upper 80s. lows tonight will reach the upper 60s. Scattered showers return on Saturday and Sunday, though. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury to get Zimmerman case today. The six-woman panel heard closing arguments from prosecutors Thursday afternoon, and will listen to the defense this morning in the Florida trial of George Zimmerman, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of teenager Trayvon Martin. The judge in the case will also allow the jury to convict on the lesser charge of manslaughter, which still carries a possible prison sentence of 30 years. Jurors should start their deliberations this afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas prices rising. You might want to fill up your car today, as USA Today reports prices are expected to jump over the next few days. In fact, Gasbuddy.com already reports prices at the pump in north Jefferson County have jumped as much as 12 cents per gallon, with the lowest price this morning of $3.20.9 reported at Murphy Oil in Gardendale, next to Walmart. The political unrest in Egypt is to blame; that country exports little oil, but the troubles might affect oil shipments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports: Freeman gets the nod. Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman has been added to the National League roster for next week's MLB All-Star Game, after he won the &quot;Final Vote&quot; fan balloting over Yasiel Puig of Los Angeles. Freeman responded by driving home four runs with three hits Thursday night as the Braves beat Cincinnati 6-5, keeping Atlanta in first place by six games in the NL East. Meanwhile, Derek Jeter's return to the New York Yankees' lineup was short-lived, as he was pulled out of his first appearance in 91 games after tightness in his right thigh. He'll undergo an MRI today.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a jury acquits George Zimmerman of the racially charged 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, few local defense attorneys will be surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be shocked if there wasn't an acquittal,&quot; said veteran defense attorney Michael Salnick. &quot;This case redefines reasonable doubt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Reinhart, a former federal prosecutor, agreed. &quot;I don't think the state has made its case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prevailing opinion among the defense bar was bolstered on Thursday when prosecutors in Sanford persuaded Seminole County Circuit Judge Debra Nelson to allow the six-member, all-female jury to also consider convicting Zimmerman of manslaughter -- not just second-degree murder -- when it begins deliberations today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prosecution is seeking the lesser-included offense because they don't think the case went well for them and they think they have a better chance of getting a conviction if they give the jury the option of the lesser offense,&quot; said attorney Richard Lubin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although such requests are routine, they typically come from the defense, most attorneys said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The phrase we use is, 'Hopefully, the jury will split the baby,'&quot; said attorney Craig Lawson. &quot;If you give a jury a choice, maybe they'll convict your client of the lesser offense. It's a trade-off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so-called compromise verdict is something Zimmerman's attorneys said they wanted to avoid. They argued vehemently that the jury be allowed to consider only second-degree murder -- nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What George did was an intentional act, that he knew he was pulling the trigger. The reason why he did it was self-defense, and that doesn't suggest the manslaughter charge would be appropriate,&quot; Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead attorney, told reporters after resting his case Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-defense claim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salnick said the state is playing games. &quot;The prosecution is hoping something will stick to the wall,&quot; he said. &quot;If the prosecution was doing what it's supposed to do, and that's seeking justice, it should be an up-or-down decision on second-degree murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, a charge that could send him to prison for life, jurors must be convinced that he acted with &quot;ill will, hatred or spite.&quot; To convict him of manslaughter, which carries a maximum 30-year sentence because it involved a firearm, jurors must decide only that he showed reckless indifference to human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real problem for prosecutors is that Zimmerman is claiming he acted in self-defense, said Palm Beach County Assistant State Attorney Craig Williams. &quot;Hands down it's the best defense a defendant can raise,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the accused raises other defenses, like false identification or that he was out of town when the crime occurred, he has to prove his claims. However, if a person insists they acted in self-defense, it is up to prosecutors to disprove it. &quot;We have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense,&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he hasn't followed the case closely, other prosecutors told him that they share the views of their courtroom adversaries. &quot;The state has a weak case,&quot; Williams said, quoting co-workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lack of witnesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman claims the unarmed Martin attacked him when he confronted the teen who was walking back to the home of his father's fianc&eacute;e after buying Skittles and iced tea at a convenience store near the gated townhouse community where Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no eyewitnesses to refute Zimmerman's claims, it is difficult to prove that he acted with ill will, hatred or spite, Williams said. If someone had heard Zimmerman yelling racial epithets at Martin before the two tussled in the dark, prosecutors would have the ammunition they needed for a second-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's just no witness to testify to any of this stuff,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reinhart agreed. &quot;The whole issue in this case -- the one and only issue -- is who started the fight,&quot; he said. Since no one witnessed the confrontation, jurors are left to decide whether or not to believe Zimmerman's explanation of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reinhart said he understands the public pressure, the howls of racism that pushed prosecutors to pursue charges against Zimmerman after Sanford police initially cleared him of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if it were me -- and these are all big ifs -- if after looking at the evidence and seeing what they had, I would have walked away from it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawson said as a lawyer he shares some of the same concerns. But, he said, as a black man it's difficult not to believe Martin is dead simply because of his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once Zimmerman started to profile this guy, saying he was wearing a hoodie, had no business in the neighborhood and was acting suspicious,&quot; he said of initial calls Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, made to police before he decided to confront Martin. &quot;You just wonder, would he have done it if he were a white teenager?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some TV commentators at George Zimmerman's trial have found the prosecution's case lacking. This case started the minute Zimmerman called 911 and spoke to the dispatcher. When he ignored the dispatcher's advice not to follow Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he was guilty of precipitating the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That should have been the foundation of the prosecutor's case. At first, when this did not happen, I believed that the law itself prevented the approach. But it is becoming apparent that the law did not. The prosecutor was either inexperienced, negligent or totally incompetent, by not making more of George Zimmerman's conduct prior to the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he had done what the dispatcher had said, the murder would not have happened. If George Zimmerman is not accountable for his actions, then provoking another into aggressive action so you can &quot;defend yourself&quot; can become premeditated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A not guilty verdict can set a dangerous precedent. George Zimmerman may go free because of a lack of insight on the part of the prosecutor. If he does go free, can this verdict be overturned because of improper representation for the victim?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman guilty of something</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not your typical stance from a black woman, but George Zimmerman will not be convicted of second-degree murder, and at this point I don't think a jury should convict him of second-degree murder. I do, however, believe George Zimmerman profiled Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and a fight ensued because of it. But is Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder? Or is he guilty of second-degree racism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were a member of the Zimmerman jury, I'd have reasonable doubt created by this unfortunate chain of events. None of the witnesses saw exactly what happened during the most important time frame: the beginning of the fight and the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who started the fight and was deadly force necessary? Zimmerman may actually be guilty of second-degree murder and have killed Trayvon, but can the prosecution prove that he is? I cannot say for sure if he's guilty of second-degree murder. However, he is guilty of something. It could be he's guilty of a lesser charge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limit fireworks to Fourth of July</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a week after the Fourth of July holiday and people are still setting off fireworks. They have these especially loud ones that sound like a cannon going off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I live in an over-55 community where there are usually a number of sick people. Don't these people have a right to some peace and quiet? One misguided person is allowed to disturb the peace of hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I propose that a law is passed allowing setting fireworks off on July 4 only, not two days before and a week after. It is called &quot;disturbing the peace.&quot; If a person has such patriotic fervor, why not read the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence instead?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior arcades cheap pastime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities have closed &quot;senior arcades&quot; for reasons that are not clear to me. The decision has denied an outlet for many old-timers who could partake of an inexpensive pastime in a relaxing atmosphere. The opportunity to meet other seniors and strike up friendships was also a casualty of this decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arcades provided snacks and other meals in addition to awards of prizes that were redeemable at grocery stores and restaurants. They provided alternatives to costly gaming parlors such as Hard Rock. Closing them ultimately will do more harm than good.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians change when they benefit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., was on CBS Sunday morning showing his recovery from a stroke. While he is still somewhat impaired, he has recovered enough to do his job effectively. During the year he was off, he received the finest medical care at no cost and his full salary. He said he would have to &quot;re-examine&quot; Medicaid because the 11 therapy sessions it allows &quot;regular people&quot; would have prevented his recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about extending unemployment compensation to those unable to find work, he said he was still against it. Without the free care that is unavailable to most Americans, this celebrated now-hero would likely be in a vegetative state. It is simply astonishing that when politicians so opposed to anything government does have a personal experience that shows that maybe there is some good in government after all, their views change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witness Gov. Chris Christie after Sandy or Sen. Rob Portman's about-face on gay marriage when he learned of his gay son. Surely there is waste and inefficiency in government, but to condemn all that government does until some personal benefit emerges flays open the hypocrisy of the radical right for all the world to see.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. hardly bastion of democracy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate about democracy in Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries is in all the newspapers and on every TV program. However, how democratic is our country? We are not really as democratic as our news outlets try to make us seem and then castigate others for not being inclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional primaries bring out only 20 percent or so of eligible voters of a specific party who elect their candidate. That's no way to get elected officials who represent the majority of the voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lack of democracy gets worse once a person is elected to Congress. In the House, the leader of the majority party can deny the full House from ever voting on an issue by refusing to put it on the House agenda. This is not democracy. It is a dictatorship in the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate's filibuster rule, which allows just the threat of a filibuster by one member to require 60 votes to get an actual vote on the bill, is another thwarting of democracy. A change of rules in both houses of Congress is needed to make this country approach a real democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When one thinks of Palm Beach, one might think of &quot;snooty&quot; folks with lots and lots of money. Of course, they are not all snooty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, thanks to The Post's article &quot;Ancient burial sites prove costly for Palm Beachers,&quot; we know that underneath those mansions with their fancy swimming pools, tennis courts and beautiful landscaping lies a &quot;wealth&quot; of knowledge about the island and surrounding areas before history was recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even ordinary people can get excited about the archaeological findings such as artifacts, burial sites and human remains of people who lived thousands of years before the Flaglers, Mizners and Kennedys. But not all of the island residents are in favor of the town ordinance to monitor &quot;diggings&quot; on properties where maps show archaeological sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town Council President David Rosow voted no &quot;just for spite.&quot; He vehemently objects to the residents having to pay so much of their own money to allow excavations on their properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Palm Beachers now find themselves the caretakers of ancient villages, and it is their responsibility to share the findings with the rest of us. Palm Beach could become a shining spot in Floridan history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd be one of the first people to say our age of political correctness has gone overboard, but for Mr. Rosow to describe a bone or arrowhead as &quot;some such nonsense&quot; truly shifts the pendulum the other way. What a horrible insult to Native American culture!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rosow goes on to say that former inhabitants should have taken better care of the property if it has meaning to them. How could they have? What power did they have over disease and attack from invading Europeans? It's another example of the wealthy being completely out of touch with anything besides their own comfort and bank accounts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wouldn't be surprised if George Zimmerman's self-defense claim prevails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broken nose and bruises on his head, combined with the contradictory eyewitness testimony, probably will introduce enough uncertainty for jurors to conclude that Zimmerman's decision to use his handgun to kill the unarmed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin might fall short of the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard for a conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are illuminations from this case that go beyond the narrow parameters of this criminal trial. Things that are harder to justify. Here are a couple: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many sketchy characters in Florida are permitted to carry guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was one of them. Despite being arrested for battery on a law-enforcement officer and the subject of a domestic-violence restraining order, he was one of the 1 million Floridians who was licensed to carry a concealed handgun in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Florida's leaders were less interested in promoting the gun industry, applicants like Zimmerman would be denied permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if Zimmerman were unarmed that night, he probably would have stayed in his vehicle, as the police dispatcher told him to do, after he had phoned in his suspicions about Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But instead, Zimmerman got out with his loaded gun to confront the teenager, who was not &quot;up to no good,&quot; as Zimmerman had concluded. Whatever happened during that confrontation, the end was not in dispute: An unarmed 17-year-old kid who was just trying to walk to his father's house was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting guns in the hands of hotheads, and making them feel entitled to use them in public to resolve otherwise nonlethal encounters, is a recipe for disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just ask the survivors of the two janitors at Alexander W. Dreyfoos Jr. School of the Arts in West Palm Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The janitors had to work with Javier Burgos, a fellow janitor with a history of anger issues that had gone on for years. Burgos, who has disappeared after the shooting deaths of two of his colleagues last month, was another concealed-weapons permit-holder sanctioned by the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police searched his home, they found at least 14 firearms and a backpack full of ammunition. All legal. And all in the hands of a guy who routinely scared his coworkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism is alive and thriving in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, I received a viral email that purported to tell me what Trayvon&nbsp;Martin really looked like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In reality, 'little Trayvon' at the time of his death stood almost 6'2&quot; tall and weighed 175 muscular pounds,&quot; the email read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was accompanied by a photo of a muscular black man with facial and neck tattoos glaring at the camera. The photo was supposed to show the real Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The email, according to the debunking Snopes.com website, has been circulating for 14 months. The person in the photo is not the teenage Martin, but a 33-year-old former gang member-turned-rapper named Jayceon Terrell Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real Martin, according to the autopsy report, was 5-foot-11 and 158 pounds and had no facial or neck tattoos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what gives? Why are so many people willing and eager to turn Martin into a bigger, stronger menacing-looking person nearly double his real age? Why does vile stuff like this go viral on the Internet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same mistake that Zimmerman made in assuming that Martin was up to no good is being echoed by a country full of other Zimmermans who need to turn the dead teenager into a menacing thug who deserved being killed that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There wouldn't be fake photos of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin making him look like an adult he-man if he were white. And there wouldn't be a nation of people so willing to buy into that fiction, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in this case is that a black teenager minding his own business ended up dead, and it had a lot to do with guns and racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the jury decides won't change that.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not George Zimmerman is acquitted of killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the speculation that a not-guilty verdict will trigger riots in pockets of &quot;urban America&quot; is ridiculous. It is also racist because it assumes black people are too socially immature to deal with disappointment without resorting to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be some angry demonstrations here and there for sure, but it is more likely that members of the press will outnumber the demonstrators. There will be a flurry of angry reaction and discussion on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms, but that's about it. The talk will very quickly return to whatever else is trending that day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one in his right mind ever assumed justice was possible in a case like this. People were amazed that many months after the incident, charges were filed against George Zimmerman at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To think young people -- at least those of &quot;rioting age&quot; -- have a lot of hope invested in the criminal justice system is to engage in magical thinking. Believe me, they don't. Most either weren't born yet or are too young to remember the acquittal of the white cops who beat Rodney King, a court verdict that triggered several days of rioting in Los Angeles 21 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young people have to go to YouTube to see what that fuss was about. The L.A. riots are not a model for dissent for today's black youth. In fact, the last time there was a racially charged riot in America, Arsenio Hall was still on the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most kids' images of riots today are of sofas burning at Penn State after Joe Paterno's firing or of a melee at the local mall on Black Friday. Most riots this decade are generated after sports events, frequently at colleges -- either as out-of-control celebrations or as venting by disgruntled fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spate of &quot;flash mob&quot; incidents a few years ago involved dozens of black kids flooding downtown areas of cities such as Philadelphia and Indianapolis. The Drudge Report focused on these events as evidence of a black youth insurgency occurring under America's nose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those &quot;uprisings&quot; -- organized on social media as opportunistic snatch-and-grabs -- never amounted to more than a few purse snatchings, some scuffles, some broken windows and zero loss of life. There was no widespread property damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flash mobs are hardly the stuff of Charles Deslondes' 500-man slave revolt in New Orleans in 1811 or Nat Turner's plantation massacres years later. They aren't political or based on legitimate grievances -- they're criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the paranoid fantasy of mass black rioting in reaction to the Zimmerman jury verdict continues to be fueled by half-remembered incidents of petty criminality and riots from decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frightened white people don't make nuanced distinctions when they see blacks acting up on their television screens. Things get easily conflated, especially when Fox News is telling America to watch out for scary black people in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even baseless rumors of potential social disorder can stir elemental fears that harken back to the darkest days of our nation's history. The horrific irony, of course, is that for centuries black people were the victims of riots in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the tricky prism of race in America, riots have become an exclusively &quot;black thang&quot; in the popular imagination. Even a casual Google search shows how silly a notion that is, but that doesn't mean it isn't a widespread assumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week in Florida, the Sanford police and the Broward County sheriff's department teamed up to record a public service announcement featuring local youths urging calm in the event of frustration with the Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a well-meaning, but corny, video featuring black cops flanking two black kids trying desperately to rap something meaningful and failing badly. It is a laughable, insulting and aesthetically ludicrous enterprise. If anything, it will perpetuate the widespread notion that law enforcement in Broward County is clueless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether he's found guilty or not, the fight against the so-called &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws that made George Zimmerman's confrontation with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin possible will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendant himself is a non-entity as far as most blacks are concerned. He's a convenient symbol for both sides of an ugly dispute over the nature of justice in America. He's not worth rioting over. His conscience will eventually eat at him far more effectively than any verdict, if he's lucky.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- George Zimmerman's defense attorney gave his final arguments today, telling jurors he will show them the neighborhood watch volunteer's &quot;pure, unadulterated innocence&quot; of second-degree murder when he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Mark O'Mara told jurors the burden was on prosecutors, and he said they hadn't proven Mr. Zimmerman's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr. O'Mara said prosecutors built a case on a series hypothetical &quot;could've beens&quot; and &quot;maybes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it hasn't been proven, it's not just there,&quot; Mr. O'Mara said. &quot;You can't fill in the gaps. You can't connect the dots. You're not allowed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six jurors could begin deliberating later today. Because there were no eyewitnesses, jurors will likely rely heavily on testimony -- which was often conflicting -- from police, neighbors, friends and family members. They will have to decide if they can determine who was yelling for help on a 911 call that recorded the shooting, and whether Mr. Zimmerman was a wannabe cop who took the law into his own hands or someone who was in a fight for his life, with his head being repeatedly slammed into the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US AIRWAYS SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- US Airways' CEO says shareholders have approved the proposed merger with American Airlines, one of the final steps remaining for the deal to create the world's biggest airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doug Parker said today that enough shares were cast in favor of the merger to guarantee approval. The margin was not immediately available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owners of US Airways Group Inc. stock would get 28 percent of the shares in the combined company, with the rest going to creditors, employees and shareholders of American Airlines parent AMR Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal is still being reviewed by antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice. It also needs the approval of the judge overseeing American's bankruptcy proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STUDENT LOAN DEAL FALLS APART</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Senators are back to the starting line in their search for a compromise that would reduce interest rates on student loans after being spooked by the $22 billion price tag that accompanied a potential deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers from both parties had agreed on a tentative proposal that offered Democrats the promise that interest rates would not reach 10 percent and gave Republicans a link between borrowing terms and the financial markets that they sought. But that deal's red ink proved disqualifying and sent them back to square one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators and their top aides, along with White House and Education Department officials, were going to return to negotiations for a deal that would undo the rate increase on subsidized Stafford loans, which doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without congressional action before students return to campus, the increase could mean an extra $2,600 for an average student, according to Congress' Joint Economic Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $22 billion cost for the 10-year rate compromise, however, stopped progress in its tracks and sent lawmakers back to the drawing board. The unexpected cost estimate was unlikely to end talks among lawmakers about how they might reduce rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARSENIC LIMITS SET FOR APPLE JUICE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Parents who have been fretting over the low levels of arsenic found in apple juice can feel better about buying one of their kids' favorite drinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Food and Drug Administration is setting a new limit on the level of arsenic allowed in apple juice, after more than a year of public pressure from consumer groups worried about the contaminant's effects on children. Nationwide, apple juice is second only to orange juice in popularity, according to industry groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new regulation, apple juice containing more than 10 parts per billion could be removed from the market and companies could face legal action. Agency officials stressed that the vast majority of juices on the market are already below the threshold.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, instead of attacking a Hispanic senator, Marco Rubio, I will defend a Hispanic citizen, George Zimmerman, on trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin. (Zimmerman would make a better senator.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's becoming obvious why no charges were brought against Zimmerman in this case until Al Sharpton got involved. With the prosecution's witnesses making the defense's case, the inquisitors' last stand is to claim that, if the races were reversed, the black guy would have been instantly charged with murder. As explained in The New York Times:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Had Mr. Martin shot and killed Mr. Zimmerman under similar circumstances, black leaders say, the case would have barreled down a different path: Mr. Martin would have been quickly arrested by the Sanford Police Department and charged in the killing, without the benefit of the doubt.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is nearly impossible to imagine such a case in a world where half of all murders and most robberies are committed by blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were at least eight burglaries in the 14 months before Zimmerman's encounter with Martin. Media accounts admit that &quot;most&quot; of these were committed by black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just six months before, two men had broken into the home of a neighbor, Olivia Bertalan, while she was alone with her infant son. She had enough time to call 911 before running upstairs and locking herself in a room. The burglars knew she was home, but robbed the place anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bertalan had seen the burglars just before they broke in, one at the front door and one at the back. They were young black males who lived in the Retreat by Twin Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another case, a black teenager stole a bicycle off Zimmerman's front porch. It was never recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weeks before Zimmerman saw Martin, he saw another young black male peering into the window of a neighbor's house. He called the cops, but by the time they arrived, the suspect was gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few days later, another house was burglarized. The thieves took jewelry and a laptop. Workers across the street had seen two black teenagers near the house at the time of the robbery. When they spotted one of the teens the next day, they called the police. The cops found the stolen laptop in his backpack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only reason it's hard to imagine the Zimmerman case with the races reversed is that it's hard to imagine a white teenager living in a mixed-race, middle-class community, mugging a black homeowner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is, however, at least one case of a black homeowner fatally shooting a white troublemaker. He was not charged with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 2006, John White was asleep at his Long Island home when his teenage son woke him to say there was a mob of white kids shouting epithets in front of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White grabbed a loaded Beretta and headed out to the end of the driveway to confront the mob. A scuffle ensued, and White shot and killed one of the kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White was charged and convicted of illegal weapons possession and involuntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to 20 months to four years in prison, but after five months was pardoned by Gov. David Paterson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John White wasn't knocked to the ground and punched. He wasn't even touched, though he claimed the white teen was lunging at him. Talk about no reason to &quot;follow,&quot; there was no reason for him to leave the safety of his locked home. White's son knew the kids. They could have waited for the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, yes, this case probably would be very different if Zimmerman and Martin's races were reversed. It is only when the victim is black that we must have a show trial, a million-dollar reward paid to the victim's parents and the threat of riots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;As the George Zimmerman winds down, we write a story talking to local leaders about the potential for a riots here, there and around the country if Zimmerman is acquitted. Two leaders think we're beyond that. But two think it's a possibility. There's no telling with the frustration some youth have towards authority.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA - For three weeks, the TV at Dianne Hart's beauty salon in East Tampa has been locked on George Zimmerman's trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Hart's clients get their hair done, she and they watch the prosecution and defense attack witnesses in the trial in which Zimmerman is accused of second-degree murder in last year's shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's the topic of the day, said Hart, 58, who owns Ms. Dee's World of Beauty and is the chief executive officer for the nonprofit East Tampa Business and Civic Association. The community is hoping that he's charged with something.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the trial nears its end, Hart and her clients also are wondering what the reaction will be in Sanford, in the state and across the nation if Zimmerman is acquitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everybody is wondering, will this spur riots across the country if this man is let go, said Hart, the former president of the Hillsborough County Democratic Black Caucus. People are very concerned that if something does not happen, (people) will take to the streets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I hate to think what will occur, she said. I think it will spur some riots around the country. That is a real fear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hart isn't the only one concerned about what might happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gov. Rick Scott said on Thursday that he has been in touch with law enforcement agencies throughout Florida and they're prepared for whatever happens with the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is working with the Sanford Police Department and the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. The Orange County Sheriff's Office said it is prepared to assist. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Thursday, the Sarasota Police Department held a news conference with local leaders, asking the community not to react with violence after the verdict is announced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Florida, officials also are taking steps. Martin was from Miami Gardens and was visiting his father and his father's fiancee in Sanford when the confrontation with Zimmerman occurred in February 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Broward County Sheriff's Office has released public service announcements encouraging people to protest peacefully, and the Miami-Dade Police Department plans to create zones where people can gather to demonstrate peacefully once the verdict is announced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tampa Police Department also has reached out to community leaders. Police Chief Jane Castor has spoken to NAACP officials, and police supervisors and patrol officers have communicated with civic leaders, said Laura McElroy, a police spokeswoman. We don't expect any issues, but, of course, we are prepared, she said. We realize it's an emotional topic and people might have a passionate response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tampa police plan to have normal staffing the day the verdict is reached but are prepared to bring in extra officers if needed, McElroy said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this point we don't expect any trouble, she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> St. Petersburg Police Department and the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office officials said they are monitoring the case but don't have a plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In October 1996, St. Petersburg was thrust into the national spotlight when a white St. Petersburg police officer fatally shot black motorist TyRon Lewis. A riot broke out the night of the shooting. A second riot broke out the next month when a grand jury declined to indict the officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We don't anticipate any violent reaction to any jury decision one way or the other, said Mike Puetz, a St. Petersburg Police Department spokesman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Curtis Stokes, a former Hillsborough County NAACP president, said he expects peaceful protests - not riots - if Zimmerman is acquitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think it's overblown, said Stokes, 44, of Tampa. Naturally, people are going to be upset. I don't see the widespread rioting. It's 2013. I think the African-American community is beyond rioting. We're for peaceful protest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stokes finds it offensive that people think the black community  will riot if it doesn't get a guilty verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think they go there because it's the easy thing to point to, Stokes said. They always associate rioting with African-Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of the day, we're a nation of laws, he said. Sometimes you win; sometimes you lose. No one rioted when Casey Anthony got off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michelle Patty remembers the riots in Tampa in 1967 after a white Tampa police officer fatally shot 19-year-old Martin Chambers, who was black, while investigating a burglary near downtown Tampa. The shooting sparked three days of riots and looting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It created the worst riot this city has ever seen, Patty said. I never wanted to see anything like that anywhere. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She fears rioting could occur if Zimmerman is acquitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's high unemployment and teenagers who can't find work, Patty said. Many blacks are frustrated because they feel African-Americans get stiffer prison sentences, Patty said. African-Americans also empathize with the Martin family, she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a lot of pent-up frustration, said Patty, who owns a medical referral service and is bishop-elect of Legacy Fellowships of Churches and Ministries, based in Tampa It can erupt over something like this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Right now we're sitting on a powder keg, she said. A lot of people feel there's no justice when it comes to an African-American male. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patty, who raised three boys who are now adults, said that when she sees Martin's photo she imagines the fear and terror he must have felt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He didn't know what this man was going to do, said Patty, 59. What was going on in his mind, and this man was trailing him? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State Rep. Darryl Rouson doesn't think there will be rioting if Zimmerman is acquitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elements of the community have moved beyond that, said Rouson, 58. There's an appropriate way to express disappointment other than resorting to lawlessness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No matter what happens with the verdict, we must respect the system of justice, he said. As flawed as it is because of the human element, it still remains the greatest in the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He applauds the law enforcement agencies that have taken the initiative to communicate with their communities. There is tension that started last year when the incident occurred, but communication can help diffuse the lingering stress, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If George Zimmerman is found not guilty, there will be hard feelings in segments of the black community, said Rouson, a former president of the NAACP in St. Petersburg who in 1981 became the first black prosecutor hired in Pinellas County. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But riots can't be the answer, Rouson said. An appropriate response, he said, might be constructive protests similar to the ones that rose throughout the nation when people sought charges against Zimmerman.The world is watching. The community is watching, he said. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: Fuzzy thinking (email to editor, July 11)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think letter writer David Lubin misses the point with the prosecution not wanting the fact that Trayvon Martin was smoking weed to be allowed into evidence. It's not a matter of proving whether it mellows a person out or not; rather, it is a matter of presenting a certain image of character. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution, with a lot of assistance from the media and even President Obama, has been trying to present Martin as this good, innocent kid who would never do anything wrong. It's the job of the prosecution to paint George Zimmerman as someone looking for trouble and Martin as someone who is just a good kid. Having dope in his system doesn't do that and instead creates a negative picture of Martin to the jury in the same way his girlfriend did with the &quot;cracker&quot; comments and other statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Image isn't everything, but it is a lot. Committing one form of illegal activity is not good for Martin's image even if it has no effect on proving who was on top in the brawl, or whether Zimmerman was justified in pulling the trigger or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Means, Tampa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- - -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to long ago, Trevor Dooley was found guilty after using the stand your ground law right here in Tampa. The final reason, after all the arguments, was that he had brought a gun to the situation. George Zimmerman did, too. He had a permit to carry a gun. Dooley did, too. Dooley, in his 70s, was fighting an ex-Marine in his 40s. Zimmerman, 28 at the time, was into it with a teenager. Dooley got 8 years. If Zimmerman is found not guilty, then bring Trevor Dooley's case back to court. Unless skin color really doesn't matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The prosecutor tries to paint George Zimmerman as the aggressor.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda spent nearly four hours Thursday trying to convince the jury that George Zimmerman was a lying, racist, paranoid, wanna-be cop who stalked 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin through a gated community because he thought the teen was a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor tried to use Zimmerman's own words against him, highlighting for the jury parts of a call Zimmerman made to police before he shot Martin dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These a--holes,&quot; Zimmerman had said during the recorded call. &quot;They always get away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead. He is dead through no fault of his own. He is dead because another man made assumptions,&quot; de la Rionda said during his closing arguments. &quot;Because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks on this earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's goal was to convince the jury of six women that Zimmerman showed ill will, hatred or spite that night, which is necessary to win a second-degree murder conviction. The jury will have another, lesser charge to consider as well: manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson ruled earlier Thursday that the jury could consider the lesser charge, which was a blow to Zimmerman's defense team. She did not allow the state to present the jury with a third charge: third-degree murder. A manslaughter conviction requires only that prosecutors prove Zimmerman, 29, killed without lawful justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the way Florida law imposes longer sentences for crimes committed with a gun, manslaughter could end up carrying a penalty as high as 30 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman got into a scuffle with Martin after spotting the teen while driving through his gated townhouse complex on a rainy night in February 2012. Zimmerman has claimed he fired in self-defense after Martin sucker-punched him and began slamming his head into the pavement. Prosecutors have disputed his account and portrayed him as the aggressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was wearing a hoodie,&quot; de la Rionda said of Martin. &quot;Last I heard, that's not against the law. But in this man's eyes, he was up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor pointed out that Zimmerman, who has said he didn't know the teen was dead, did not provide first aid or CPR to Martin after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time and again he talked about fear as a way to challenge Zimmerman's claim of self-defense, arguing that it was Martin who tried to run away and Zimmerman who followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it really self-defense when you follow somebody?&quot; he asked. &quot;When you ... think about it, who was more scared? Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, unfortunately, can't come into this room and tell you how he was feeling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asked the jury to test Zimmerman's actions against their understanding of fear. He told them Zimmerman had already made up his mind about Martin, that he had spent 18 months training in martial arts, that he was older, heavier and carried two flashlights and a Kel-Tec handgun, fully loaded with one in the chamber. He asked them to consider why Zimmerman didn't roll his window down, introduce himself as a neighborhood watchman and ask Martin what he was doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also recounted the testimony of Rachel Jeantel, who was talking on the phone with Martin the night of the shooting. Jeantel testified that Martin told her he was being followed by a &quot;creepy-a-- cracker,&quot; and that she took that to mean pervert and encouraged her friend to run. De la Rionda asked whether Martin had the right to his own self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wants you to let him off,&quot; de la Rionda said, &quot;because he killed the only eyewitness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda presented a new puzzle to jurors as well. Zimmerman has claimed from the beginning that he felt Martin reaching for his gun, which is why he feared for his life. But the prosecutor wondered how Martin, in the darkness, would have even seen the weapon, which is small and black and was allegedly holstered inside the waistband of Zimmerman's pants, near the rear of his hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He replayed parts of a television interview Zimmerman did with Sean Hannity of Fox News. In the interview, Hannity asks Zimmerman if he ever considered that Martin was afraid of him, and ran away because he thought he was in danger. Zimmerman says Martin wasn't really running away, but &quot;skipping.&quot; De la Rionda stopped the video and skipped across the courtroom, sarcastically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorneys are expected to deliver their closing arguments this morning, followed by the prosecution's rebuttal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A little-known unit of the Department of Justice, the Community Relations Service, was deployed to Sanford, FL, following the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judicial Watch on Wednesday, July 10th, 2013 in a press release</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE RULING: MOSTLY FALSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the right-leaning crowd, it's the latest blight against the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing a public records haul, Judicial Watch says the Justice Department's &quot;Community Relations Service&quot; responded to escalating racial tension in Sanford, Fla., following Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's shooting death by helping &quot;organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman,&quot; his shooter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police did not arrest Zimmerman because he said he was acting in self defense, churning outrage among the African-American community and national civil rights leaders. But two months later, a special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Rick Scott announced second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman. His trial on those charges was this week, and a verdict is expected soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the trial, Judicial Watch released the results of federal and state public-information requests it received regarding CRS involvement in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRS workers applied for various reimbursements for working in Sanford from March 25-April 12, 2012, Judicial Watch announced July 10, 2013. The group said it obtained the information from a Freedom of Information Act request filed around that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate &quot;investigative bulletin&quot; post touting the findings, the group went further, saying the &quot;group actively worked to forment (sic) unrest, spending thousands of taxpayer dollars on travel and hotel rooms to train protesters throughout Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman,&quot; president Tom Fitton states in a news release. &quot;My guess is that most Americans would rightly object to taxpayers paying government employees to help organize racially-charged demonstrations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news sparked outrage among conservative sites, including the Heritage Foundation and The Daily Caller, and attracted mainstream attention at CNN. The Rush Limbaugh Show went with the headline &quot;Obama Regime Organized Trayvon Protests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wanted to take a closer look. Did the Justice Department team really organize rallies against Zimmerman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Community Relations Service bills itself as the Justice Department's &quot;peacemaker,&quot; established in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and intended to resolve local conflicts grounded in race. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act in 2009 broadened the agency's charge to include unrest dealing with sexual orientation, religious bigotry or disability. CRS requested a $12 million budget for 61 positions for the 2012-13 fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to hate crimes and police-community relations typically dominate the agency's work, according to annual reports. After the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, CRS employees responded to attacks against Muslim and Arab-American communities. Some of the ways the unit works to calm potential riots is by sending its employees to help officials or volunteers manage tense situations when police use force against citizens or when there are major demonstrations or school disruptions, according to the agency's website. Sometimes they draw up mediation agreements to help parties move forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News accounts portray CRS employees responding to trouble as inconspicuous, secretive bystanders. They're not part of the chaos, but quietly monitoring it (usually in navy blue windbreakers, dark sunglasses and caps embroidered with the DOJ logo, according to the Orlando Sentinel).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judicial Watch includes links to travel vouchers it received as part of its FOIA request to build the case that the DOJ team helped organize anti-Zimmerman rallies. The vouchers do not include much information beyond travel and lodging expenses, the date and location of the trip, and a short description of the purpose. The employee's name is among redacted information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Fitton said the voucher costs seem reasonable, but his group still objects to public funds being used to deploy the CRS to Sanford in connection with the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a sampling:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On March 25-27, 2012, CRS deployed to Sanford, FL to work marches, demonstrations and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.&quot; Amount paid to voucher: $674.14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar itinerary for March 30-April 1, 2012, says, &quot;CRS was in Sanford, FL to provide technical assistance to the City of Sanford, event organizers, and law enforcement agencies for the march and rally on March 31.&quot; Voucher cost: $751.60.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRS went to Altamonte Springs on March 30-April 1, 2012, &quot;to provide interregional support for protest deployment in Florida.&quot; Total voucher: $751.60.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On April 3-12, 2012, CRS was in Sanford, FL to provide technical assistance, conciliation, and onsite mediation during demonstrations planned in Sanford.&quot; Total voucher: $1,307.40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CRS was contacted by a senior project manager for the city of Sanford as community dissent reared up, according to news reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key player in the Sanford controversy is Thomas Battles, the CRS southeastern regional director who has acted as a neutral party in dicey racial issues for three decades, including the Eli&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez custody case. He does not talk to the media, per CRS policy, but his work has not gone unnoticed. The mayor of Sanford called him &quot;a voice of reason&quot; in the tumultuous weeks following Martin's death, according to a Miami Herald profile of Battles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battles did not organize protests, as Judicial Watch claims. His team did meet with organizers and city officials to make sure protests happened peacefully, news stories show, and he helped the city draft a nine-point plan aiming to foster better communications between police and residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Judicial Watch points this out, Florida newspapers report he also secured police protection for a group of students who marched 40 miles from Daytona to Sanford over three days. The student group staged a sit-in in front of the Sanford police department's doors, causing it to shut down for the day. Fitton said helping them get there was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battles also organized a league of local pastors, known as Sanford Pastors Connecting, to help the community move on regardless of the verdict in Zimmerman's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fitton said he remains convinced the Department of Justice unit went too far in siding with the Zimmerman protesters. He pointed to a local pastor's comments in the Orlando Sentinel about the peacekeepers, saying, &quot;They were there for us,&quot; and &quot;We felt protected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the point of the program was to take steps to avoid exacerbated confrontation that could have cost the taxpayer even more money in the long run, said Robin Davis, director of the University of Florida's Institute for Dispute Resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think there's any cause and effect between this mediation and the prosecution going forth,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with public documents, Judicial Watch said the Department of Justice sent the Community Relations Service to Sanford in the wake of Martin's death &quot;to help organize and manage rallies and protests against George Zimmerman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judicial Watch's statement contends an element of truth: Justice Department employees were sent to Sanford, in part to deal with community uprising, including protests. But they were sent with the idea of keeping the situation peaceful and calm, not to instigate or condone protests or violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a critical distinction being ignored in this particular claim. We rate it Mostly False.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who was tired of crime in his community and decided he was going to &quot;take care of it&quot; when he spotted Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in his neighbourhood on Feb. 26, 2012, prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told jurors Thursday in his closing argument. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda spoke to jurors for more than two hours, hoping to convince them that Zimmerman committed second-degree murder when he shot and killed Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial resumes Friday morning with the closing argument from the defence. The jury is expected to begin deliberating Friday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because a man made certain assumptions ... and because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin no longer walks on this earth,&quot; de la Rionda began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described Martin as an &quot;innocent 17-year-old kid (who) was profiled as a criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To quote the defendant, and pardon my language, he was one of those 'a------s' that get away,&quot; de la Rionda said. &quot;And he wasn't going to get away this time. Hold the defendant responsible for his actions. The law doesn't allow people to take the law into their own hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged jurors to rely on witness testimony and the facts of the case. In the case of Rachel Jeantel, Martin's friend who was on the phone with him moments before the shooting, he asked the jury not to let her unsophisticated appearance stand in the way of finding her testimony credible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda said the events leading up to the shooting began months earlier, when Zimmerman called police numerous times to report suspicious people in his neighbourhood and decided to start a neighbourhood watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in this particular case, it led to the death of an innocent 17-year-old boy, because this defendant made the wrong assumption,&quot; the prosecutor said. &quot;He profiled him as a criminal ... and that is what led to his death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday morning, circuit Judge Debra Nelson ruled that the jury would be allowed to consider manslaughter as a lesser offence, in addition to second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the judge ruled that the other lesser charge requested by the state, third-degree felony murder, would not be presented to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors will have three verdicts to choose from: second-degree murder, manslaughter or not guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a murder case that has sharply divided national opinion, a Florida jury will soon decide whether George Zimmerman is a killer who &quot;tracked&quot; and murdered an innocent black teenager or a conscientious citizen who fired a fatal bullet while fighting for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the two sides of the question presented in two weeks of stirring testimony here. Prosecutors gave their closing arguments Thursday, and the defense will present its closing today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury will then decide whether Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watch volunteer charged with killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, should be acquitted or convicted of second-degree murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murder charge carries a potential life prison term, and the maximum penalty in Florida for manslaughter is 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jury that Trayvon was an innocent teenager who is now dead because Zimmerman wrongly assumed the teen was a criminal and murdered him. Prosecutors throughout the trial have portrayed Zimmerman as a lying wannabe cop who followed Trayvon even after a police dispatcher told him via cellphone that pursuit was not necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead, and he's dead through no fault of his own,&quot; de la Rionda said to jurors. &quot;He's dead because another man made an assumption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a dramatic, at times loud closing statement, de la Rionda outlined why jurors should find Zimmerman guilty. The prosecutor focused on several  theories of his case: Trayvon would be alive if Zimmerman hadn't profiled him, the unarmed teen was pursued by a man carrying a gun, and Zimmerman gave inconsistent statements to police and a reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense team maintains that Trayvon, 17, was the aggressor and that Zimmerman shot him in self-defense during a struggle in which the teenager repeatedly bashed Zimmerman's head into a concrete sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has gripped the nation since the shooting happened on Feb. 26, 2012. Police initially did not charge Zimmerman with a crime, citing Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which allows someone who believes he is in imminent danger to take whatever steps are necessary to protect himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests ensued in several cities, including New York, by supporters of Trayvon's family. Many protesters voiced the opinion that Trayvon was targeted and killed for racial reasons. Trayvon was black, and Zimmerman is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's state prosecutor stepped in and charged Zimmerman with murder on April 11, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial, held in the same Florida city where Trayvon was killed, has brought the facts of the case under a nationally-televised spotlight, with every moment captured on camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using a projector, de la Rionda on Thursday showed jurors a photo of Zimmerman taken at the police station the night of the shooting -- alongside a close-up of Trayvon's dead body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda noted that Trayvon's hands had no blood on them. &quot;His (Trayvon's) body speaks to you,&quot; de la Rionda said. &quot;It proves to you that this defendant is lying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda told the jury the key word in the prosecution's case was &quot;assumptions.&quot; Zimmerman &quot;automatically assumed that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a criminal, and that is why we are here,&quot; de la Rionda said. Later, he said Trayvon wasn't trespassing in the gated community but was being a normal teen making a trip to the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda also painted Zimmerman as someone who already knew he could ultimately win any confrontation with Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a gun; he's got the equalizer,&quot; de la Rionda said. He asked the six-woman jury to use &quot;your God-given common sense&quot; and find Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense has called several witnesses who lived in the community where the struggle between Trayvon and Zimmerman happened. Zimmerman claims he was heading back to his truck when Trayvon assaulted him. People who live in the area said they heard screams and saw a struggle going on in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Screams can be heard in a 911 call dialed by one of the residents. That call was played for the jury. The fathers of both Trayvon and Zimmerman took the stand to testify that they were positive that the screams on the tape came from their own son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Reep, a Florida criminal defense attorney who has followed the case, said he'll be surprised if Zimmerman is convicted of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state did not prove the elements of second-degree murder,&quot; Reep said, noting that there were too many conflicting witness statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pervasive sense of dread fills Fruitvale Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on real events, the film  begins with a chaotic  opening that is instantly riveting. In the early hours of New Year's Day 2009, police respond to reports of a fight on a Bay Area Rapid Transit train and detain four young black men at a station. A policeman fires a shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oscar Grant, 22, is shot in the back as he lies on the ground handcuffed and unarmed. Captured on several cellphone cameras, the shooting is posted on websites, sparking widespread protests. Some label it an execution. Shown here in real time, the shooting footage is like a mushroom cloud hovering over the film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the unsettling opener, first-time filmmaker Ryan Coogler wisely flashes back to the day before the shooting, immersing viewers in Grant's humanity by chronicling the 24 hours leading up to his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the film plays out, the audience probaby will be overwhelmed by anger and the inability to stop what is coming. Opportunities for the story to take a different turn and avoid tragedy loom, leaving a haunting impression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though we are aware of the outcome, we can't help but hope against hope, which is testament to writer/director Coogler's multifaceted portrait of Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would have been easy to turn Grant into a sacrificial lamb, glossing over his transgressions. Yet Coogler doesn't sanctify the man, who had served time for a drug conviction and cheated on his girlfriend, who is the mother of his daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael B. Jordan is superb  as Grant, who dotes on  4-year-old Tatiana (Ariana Neal) and is determined to be a better partner to Sophina (Melonie Diaz). He sells marijuana, yet he is trying to clean up his act. He adores his mother, Wanda (Octavia Spencer), but a flashback shows he wasn't always kind to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end, we learn that the officer who shot Grant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served only 11 months. We see the face of Grant's real daughter at a memorial and are reminded that the living also were victimized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's big winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Fruitvale Station is a profoundly compelling, gut-wrenching and important film. It's particularly timely because of the trial of George Zimmerman, who is accused of shooting unarmed Trayvon Martin to death. Most important, the film reveals a face, heart and soul behind heartbreaking headlines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian police are evaluating whether charges should be laid against two radio presenters who made a prank call last year to the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for a pregnancy-related illness. NSW police have confirmed they have received the referral from the London Metropolitan Police in relation to the call by 2Day FM DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian. &quot;A referral was received from the UK metropolitan police service yesterday in relation to this matter,&quot; a NSW police spokeswoman said yesterday. &quot;The AFP (Australian Federal Police) will evaluate the referral as per the AFP's usual process to determine if any commonwealth offences are identified. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baroccoli</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the most divisive vegetable in American politics, banished under one former president, wielded as a campaign tool and used in the debate on healthcare reform. Now President Barack Obama has declared broccoli to be his favourite food. The disclosure came in response to a question from a guest at a White House dinner for children who had won a contest promoting healthy recipes. &quot;When I was a kid, my family, when they cooked vegetables they would just boil them, and they'd get all soft and mushy and tasted horrible. Now I actually like vegetables because they're prepared right,&quot; the president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many tacos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico has surpassed the United States in levels of adult obesity, a dubious distinction that experts attribute to Mexicans abandoning their traditional diet for processed snack foods and drinks. Almost one-third of adult Mexicans, 32.8 per cent, are obese compared to 31.8 per cent of Americans, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Both trail Egypt, at 34.6 per cent, Kuwait at 42.8 per cent, and the Micronesian island of Nauru at 71.1 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accused silent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for George Zimmerman rested their case yesterday without calling the former neighbourhood watch volunteer to testify, setting up the final stages of his murder trial for the shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida last year. &quot;After consulting with counsel, (I have decided) not to testify, your honour,&quot; Zimmerman said to questions from Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson. It was a rare chance to hear Zimmerman speak, as the overweight 29-year-old sat emotionless throughout most of the proceedings, smartly dressed in suits and ties bought for him by a supporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Floods spread</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flooding in western China, the worst in 50 years for some areas, has left seven people dead and 48 missing, with more than half a million others forced to evacuate or otherwise affected, the government reported yesterday. Another 1.6 million people have been affected in the north and thousands of homes damaged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - He wanted a badge. And he wanted desperately for the people wearing badges to like him, to respect him. He wanted to be one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the needy portrait of George Zimmerman painted by a state prosecutor Thursday in closing arguments of a trial that has become a national obsession during three weeks of televised and live-streamed testimony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman never became a policeman, prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told jurors, but on the night he shot an unarmed teenager he was every bit the &quot;wannabe cop,&quot; surveying his neighborhood with a mind muddied by &quot;incorrect assumptions.&quot; He profiled Trayvon Martin, the 17-year-old African American who Zimmerman killed on a rainy night in February 2012, as a criminal, as a threat, de la Rionda said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zimmerman, the aspiring lawman, was the dangerous one, the prosecutor said. To illustrate his point, the prosecutor displayed two photos side by side. One showed the Kel-Tec 9mm handgun that Zimmerman was carrying. The other showed what Martin was carrying: a can of Arizona fruit drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, de la Rionda's voiced cracked with emotion and he had to pause to compose himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, lifted her glasses off her nose and wiped tears from her eyes in the second row as de la Rionda pleaded with jurors. Across the aisle, the defendant's mother, Gladys Zimmerman, leaned into the shoulder of his father, Robert Zimmerman Sr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense will get its chance to rebut the portrait during its closing arguments on Friday, and jury deliberations could begin Friday as well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, whose mother is Hispanic and whose father is white, is claiming self-defense. He says Martin attacked him after he got out of his vehicle to look for a street name while calling a police non-emergency line. Zimmerman did not testify, but de la Rionda sought to sway jurors by pointing out possible inconsistencies or seemingly illogical statements that the defendant made in taped conversations with police investigators and during a nationally televised interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he's really in fear, why does he get out of the car?&quot; de la Rionda asked the six-woman jury and three alternates. &quot;Who started this? Who followed whom?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda, his voice dripping with sarcasm, asserted that it makes little sense that Zimmerman would be looking for a street name: There are only three streets in the Retreat at Twin Lakes, the community where the shooting took place. The prosecutor scoffed at testimony by a gym owner who testified for the defense that Zimmerman was &quot;soft,&quot; an assertion critical to the defense claim that Martin overpowered him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who has gained considerable weight since the shooting, was a fit-looking 5-foot-7 and 204 pounds the night he shot Martin, who was a slender 5-foot-8 and 158 pounds, de la Rionda told jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, but of course, he's just a pudgy, overweight man,&quot; de la Rionda said sarcastically of Zimmerman. And de la Rionda suggested it would have been impossible for Zimmerman to reach the gun he had holstered behind his back if, as he claimed, Martin was straddling him and pounding his head into a concrete walkway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors will consider charges of second-degree murder - which requires prosecutors to prove Zimmerman had a &quot;depraved mind&quot; and &quot;ill intent&quot; - and the lesser offense of manslaughter. But Judge Debra Nelson blocked a prosecution attempt to add the option of a third-degree murder charge based on the claim that Zimmerman committed child abuse since Martin was a minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, it will be the defense's turn. At a break in the prosecution's closing argument, Don West, the combative Zimmerman attorney, walked over to the defendant's father and gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Sunday, nearly three years after he was officially declared dead, Lenin Carballido was narrowly elected mayor of San Agustin Amatengo, a small town in Mexico's Oaxaca state. Carballido faked his own demise in 2010, according to Mexico's Reforma newspaper, in order to evade charges stemming from a 2004 sexual assault. With police on his trail, Carballido &quot;died&quot; and obtained a coroner's certificate in September 2010, affirming he had succumbed to &quot;natural causes&quot; after slipping into a diabetic coma. The charges were dropped. Carballido's resurrection occurred this year when he ran as a local candidate for Mexico's leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, beating his opponent Sunday by a margin of 11 votes. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Sanford, Fla., prepared for possible protests or even violence as a high-profile U.S. trial in the murder of an unarmed black teen neared its end Thursday. Neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, saying he fired in self-defence during a nighttime confrontation in February 2012 in his Florida gated community, where Martin was visiting family. Zimmerman says Martin was slamming his head into the concrete pavement when he fired his gun. The case drew national attention and protests when Zimmerman wasn't arrested for weeks after the shooting, and racial tensions have been exposed.</SPAN></P>

Jurors in federal court in Covington, Ky., on Thursday found the 2009 posts on the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based website thedirty.com about Sarah Jones were substantially false. They also found website operator Nik Richie acted with malice or reckless disregard in posting anonymous submissions. One of the posts alleged Jones had sex with every Bengals player, and the other said she probably had two sexually transmitted diseases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- &quot;Wannabe cop&quot; George Zimmerman wrongly profiled Trayvon Martin as a criminal, followed him with a gun and provoked him into a fight that resulted in the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager, a prosecutor said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead,&quot; Florida state prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jury in closing arguments of Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial. &quot;He is dead through no fault of his own. He is dead because another man made assumptions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers were due to present their closing arguments on Friday, followed by a final prosecution rebuttal, after which the jury would begin deliberating a case that has captivated and polarized much of the U.S. public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Thursday, Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson gave jurors the option of convicting Zimmerman of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Prosecutors wanted the sequestered, all-female jury to have the option of choosing a lesser offense that still carried a potentially lengthy sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense preferred an all-or-nothing choice of second-degree murder, confident it had shown Zimmerman acted in self-defense and concerned the jury might opt for what lead defense lawyer Mark O'Mara described as a &quot;compromise verdict.&quot;Pa.

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA -- Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane refused on Thursday to fight a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit is believed to be the first federal case since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that the U.S. government must recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO -- The fight over fixing Illinois' pension liability has come down to this: Unable to forge a plan to solve the state's $100 billion pension underfunding, the governor is suspending legislators' $68,000-a-year paychecks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Pat Quinn on Wednesday used his line-item veto to eliminate salaries for state lawmakers from the fiscal 2014 budget. If the salaries indeed are cut, the move saves the state $1.15 million a month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor said lawmakers have pushed the state into a crisis by failing to resolve the public pension liability that has driven Illinois' credit rating to the lowest level among U.S. states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD -- Bombers and gunmen attacked policemen and a wake in Iraq among other targets, killing at least 44 people across the country on Thursday, in the latest burst of violence that has raised concerns about a return to civil strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gunmen opened fire on two checkpoints guarding oil installations on the road between Haditha and Baiji, 111 miles north of the capital, killing 11 people, police said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAC-MEGANTIC, Quebec (AP) -- The head of the U.S. railway company whose runaway oil train crashed into a Quebec town blamed the engineer Wednesday for failing to set the brakes properly before the train hurtled down a seven-mile (11-kilometer) incline, derailed and ignited a fire that killed at least 15 people and left dozens missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the engineer has been suspended without pay and was under police supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startling disclosures from Edward Burkhardt, president and CEO of the railway's parent company, Rail World Inc., came as he encountered sharp criticism from Quebec politicians and jeers from Lac-Megantic residents while making his first visit to the lakeside town where some 60 people remain missing following Saturday's disaster. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Wednesday, the railway had defended its employees' actions, but that changed abruptly as Burkhardt singled out the engineer as culpable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think he applied some hand brakes, but the question is, did he apply enough of them?&quot; Burkhardt said. &quot;He said he applied 11 hand brakes. We think that's not true. Initially we believed him, but now we don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators look into pairing of instructor and trainee pilot on flight that crash-landed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- As Flight 214 descended over San Francisco Bay, both Asiana Airlines pilots were in new roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the left seat of the cockpit sat Lee Gang-kuk, a 46-year-old pilot with just 35 hours of experience flying a Boeing 777 who was landing the big jet for his first time at San Francisco International Airport. At his right was Lee Jeong-Min, a trainer making his first trip as an instructor pilot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the two men had years of aviation experience, this mission involved unfamiliar duties, and it was the first time they had flown together. The flight came to a tragic end when the airliner crash-landed Saturday, killing two passengers and injuring many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say investigators trying to piece together what went wrong will consider, among other factors, the pairing of the pilots, who were assigned to work together through a tightly regulated system developed after several deadly crashes in the 1980s that were blamed in part on inexperience in the cockpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Transportation Safety Board &quot;is definitely going to focus on what type of policy Asiana had in terms of crew pairing,&quot; former NTSB Chairman James Hall said. &quot;That's what the airline needs to do, be responsible so that in the cockpit you're matching the best people, especially when you're introducing someone to a new aircraft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His arm in cast and his face swollen, Boston bombing suspect pleads not guilty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOSTON (AP) -- His arm in a cast and his face swollen, a blase-looking Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty Wednesday in the Boston Marathon bombing in a seven-minute proceeding that marked his first appearance in public since his capture in mid-April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As survivors of the bombing looked on, Tsarnaev, 19, gave a small, lopsided smile to his sisters upon arriving in the courtroom. He appeared to have a jaw injury and there was swelling around his left eye and cheek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, after he leaned in toward a microphone and said, &quot;Not guilty&quot; over and over in his Russian accent, he was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs, making a kissing gesture toward his family with his lips. His sister sobbed loudly, resting her head on a woman seated next to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsarnaev faces 30 federal charges, including using a weapon of mass destruction to kill, in connection with the April 15 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260. He could get the death penalty if prosecutors choose to pursue it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proceedings took place in a heavily guarded courtroom packed not only with victims but with their families, police officers, and members of the public and the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Republicans seek way forward on immigration as Bush nudges them from the Texas sidelines</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON (AP) -- As House Republicans weighed their next steps on immigration Wednesday, former President George W. Bush nudged them ever so gently from the Texas sidelines to carry a &quot;benevolent spirit&quot; into a debate that includes a possible path to citizenship for millions living in the country illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former president's ability to sway a new generation of House conservatives was a matter of considerable doubt, especially because many of the tea party-backed lawmakers have risen to power since he left the White House and are strongly on record in opposition to any citizenship provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We care what people back home say, not what some former president says,&quot; declared Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a second-term Kansas Republican who has clashed with the party leadership in the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the timing and substance of Bush's remarks were reminders of the imperative that many national party leaders feel that Republicans must broaden their appeal among Hispanic voters to compete successfully in future presidential elections. President Barack Obama took more than 70 percent of their votes in winning a second term last fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time,&quot; Bush said at a naturalization ceremony at his presidential library in Dallas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense rests case in George Zimmerman trial, closing arguments set for Thursday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- After taking less than a week to call 18 witnesses, George Zimmerman's defense attorneys rested their case Wednesday in the neighborhood watch volunteer's second-degree murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors and defense attorneys planned to work out the jury instructions before presenting closing arguments on Thursday. Judge Debra Nelson said the case could be sent to six jurors either late that day or the next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman never testified. But jurors saw repeated video recordings of Zimmerman telling his side of the story to investigators. He claims that he shot Trayvon Martin, who was unarmed, in self-defense while the teen straddled and punched him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense started its case last Friday, and it presented half as many witnesses in half of the time that prosecutors did. Zimmerman's friends, parents and uncle testified that it's him screaming for help on a 911 call that captured sounds of the fatal fight. Martin's mother and brother had testified for the prosecution that it's Martin yelling for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convincing the jury of who was screaming for help on the 911 tape became the primary goal of prosecutors and defense attorneys because it would help jurors evaluate Zimmerman's self-defense claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO (AP) -- Egypt's military-backed government tightened a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood on Wednesday, ordering the arrest of its revered leader in a bid to choke off the group's campaign to reinstate President Mohammed Morsi one week after an army-led coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brotherhood denounced the warrants for the arrest of Mohammed Badie and nine other leading Islamists for inciting violence Monday that left dozens dead, saying &quot;dictatorship is back&quot; and vowing it will never work with the interim rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the Brotherhood are believed to be taking refuge somewhere near a continuing sit-in by its supporters at the Rabaah al-Adawiya Mosque in eastern Cairo, but it is not clear if Badie also is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brotherhood is outraged by the overthrow of Morsi, one of its own, and demands nothing less than his release from detention and his reinstatement as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security agencies have already jailed five leaders of the Brotherhood, including Badie's powerful deputy, Khairat el-Shaiter, and shut down its media outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge at N.Y. civil trial: Apple conspired with publishers to raise e-book prices in 2010</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple Inc. broke antitrust laws and conspired with publishers to raise electronic book prices significantly in spring 2010, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, citing &quot;compelling evidence&quot; from the words of the late Steve Jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said Apple knew that no publisher could risk acting alone to try to eliminateAmazon.com&amp;rsquo ;s $9.99 price for the most popular e-books so it &quot;created a mechanism and environment that enabled them to act together in a matter of weeks to eliminate all retail price competition for their e-books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apple seized the moment and brilliantly played its hand,&quot; Cote said. She wrote that Apple's deals with publishers caused some e-book prices to rise 50 percent or more virtually overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Manhattan jurist, who did not determine damages, said the evidence was &quot;overwhelming that Apple knew of the unlawful aims of the conspiracy and joined the conspiracy with the specific intent to help it succeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her decision was not surprising, since she had urged Apple to settle before trial and said the company had only a slim chance of winning. Government officials and industry experts have said e-book prices have declined and stabilized since rising after Apple entered the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navy completes 1st unmanned aircraft landing aboard USS George H.W. Bush in Atlantic Ocean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The Navy successfully landed a drone the size of a fighter jet aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time Wednesday, showcasing the military's capability to have a computer program perform one of the most difficult tasks a pilot is asked to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The landing of the X-47B experimental aircraft means the Navy can move forward with its plans to develop another unmanned aircraft that will join the fleet alongside traditional airplanes to provide around-the-clock surveillance while also possessing a strike capability. It also would pave the way for the U.S. to launch unmanned aircraft without the need to obtain permission from other countries to use their bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The X-47B experimental aircraft took off from Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland before approaching the USS George H.W. Bush, which is operating off the coast of Virginia. The drone landed by deploying a tailhook that caught a wire aboard the ship and brought it to a quick stop, just like normal fighter jets do. The maneuver is known as an arrested landing and has previously only been done by the drone on land at Patuxent River. Landing on a ship that is constantly moving while navigating through turbulent air behind the aircraft carrier is seen as a more difficult maneuver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your grandchildren and great grandchildren and mine will be reading about this historic event in their history books. This is not trivial, nor is it something that came lightly,&quot; said Rear Adm. Mat Winter, the Navy's program executive officer for unmanned aviation and strike weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The X-47B will never be put into operational use, but it will help Navy officials develop future carrier-based drones. Those drones could begin operating by 2020, according to Winter. Four companies are expected to compete for a contract to design the future unmanned aircraft, which will be awarded in Fiscal Year 2014.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- As the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began Wednesday, many Syrians who observe the daily dawn-to-dusk fast that is broken with lavish family meals are struggling to find the usually festive mood and holiday warmth as the country's bloody conflict rages for a third year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one rebel-held city, residents have resorted to begging for crumbs at a local soup kitchen, while in a refugee camp on the Jordanian border, Syrians hounded by the desert heat and dust break their fast separated from relatives back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting the deprivation brought on by the war, the U.N food agency said that 7 million people were now reliant on food aid simply to eat. The fighting that has destroyed much of the country, combined with prices that have soared in recent months, have left many Syrians struggling to get by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People come by the kitchen just begging for scraps, it tears the heart,&quot; said an activist in the rebel-held northern Syrian city of Maarat al-Numan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said activists were using a communal kitchen to distribute a simple Ramadan evening meal of rice, vegetable stew and soup to some 400 of the city's neediest families. He identified himself only by his nickname, Abu Anas, fearing for his safety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Melissa Yoakam jokingly calls her dog Shadow her &quot;car payment&quot; because she pays $250 a month for the 12-year-old's cancer treatments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She'd pay far less if she had pet insurance, but she didn't take advantage of it when Shadow was younger and when he got cancer it was too late. She uses her experience to convince colleagues not to make the same mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I should have it but I don't,&quot; she lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoakam is well-versed in the subject as benefits manager at Chipotle Mexican Grill, which is one of a growing number of companies that discount and subsidize pet insurance as a perk to workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's oldest and largest pet insurer, Veterinary Pet Insurance, offers policies at one in three Fortune 500 companies, as well as 3,400 other companies and associations across the nation, said company president Scott Liles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced Wednesday that more than 1,100 health centers in all 50 states will share $150 million in grants for outreach. It's the largest pot of federal money for in-person enrollment assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centers provide basic primary health care to millions of people, usually in low-income communities.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew (back L) delivers remarks with China's Vice Premier Wang Yang (back R) at the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&amp;ED) at the Treasury Department in Washington, July 10, 2013. (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The United States and China, the world's top emitters of greenhouse gases, agreed to five initiatives on Wednesday to cut carbon output from the largest sources, including heavy duty vehicles, manufacturing and coal-fired plants, the State Department said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S.-China climate change working group, which officials from both countries formed in April, will work with companies and non-governmental groups to develop plans by October to carry out the measures aimed at fighting climate change and cutting pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiatives are also aimed at improving energy efficiency, collection and management of greenhouse gas data, and promoting electric grids to carry more power from renewable energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group agreed to the measures at the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue held at the State Department. The two-day meeting ends on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew hosted a Chinese delegation, led by State Councilor Yang Jiechi and Vice Premier Wang Yang, at the talks that cover both economics and wider geopolitical issues.show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climate agreements will concentrate on improving technologies, and will not be binding and will not seek to cut emissions by specific volumes. Still, the hope is any cooperation could help lend support to wider international talks on greenhouse gas reductions and help finalize a global treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol on climate change by 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the one hand it's not suddenly going to transform the negotiations, I'm absolutely not saying that, but ... it will project something positive that I think will be helpful,&quot; U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern told reporters in a teleconference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China and the United States are responsible for about 43 percent of global greenhouse gas output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing the ability of the two countries to capture carbon emissions from coal-fired plants and to bury them underground was also the focus of one of Wednesday's agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to move from the research and development phase to large scale demonstration projects, Stern said. &quot;It's certainly not the case that we are going to be financing large-scale CCS (carbon capture and storage) plants in China, per se, but rather to try to spur the development of them there and also here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's move builds on an agreement last month by U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to cooperate in phasing out production and consumption of gases used in refrigerants and air conditioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The so-called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, came into wide commercial use to replace ozone-depleting chemicals that are being phased out under the 1987 Montreal Protocol. They make up roughly 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but use of the chemicals is rising at a rate of up to 9 percent a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stern said China and the United States are trying to develop alternatives to HFCs, not all of which are fully available.4.Arrested Denver Broncos executives face problems 'bigger than football' By Mike Klis, The Denver Post</SPAN></P>

Sheriff's Department, Tom Heckert, the Denver Broncos' new director of pro personnel, appears in a photo after he was arrested on June 11, 2013, and charged with driving under the influence and careless driving. Another Broncos executive, Matt Russell, was arrested over the weekend on suspicion of driving under the influence. (Associated Press)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspensions, fines and punishment may help simmer the public outrage over two Broncos executives arrested for DUI. But there is more to consider in the cases of Broncos executives Matt Russell and Tom Heckert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Broncos may have preferred to mete out punishment Tuesday, but first they consulted with the NFL. There is a process involved. There are medical evaluations that must be conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Broncos, who have said publicly that the punishment would be severe, are not providing a timetable as to when Russell, 40, and Heckert, 45 - the top two assistants to football operations boss John Elway - will be disciplined, but it may take up to a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is bigger than football,&quot; team spokesman Patrick Smyth said Wednesday. &quot;It's obviously very serious. We need to make sure we handle this the right way and give careful consideration to all of the issues involved. That process takes time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heckert, hired in early May as the Broncos' director of pro personnel, was cited for DUI on June 11 in Parker.show more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to records, he was stopped after &quot;striking the median and almost hit the stop light,&quot; the sheriff's report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heckert blew a 0.162 on a breath test upon his release nearly seven hours after his arrest, according to official documents, more than twice the legal limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Broncos had their final minicamp session June 13, after which the players, coaches and executives cleared out of team headquarters for their offseason vacation. Players are scheduled to return for training camp July 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heckert might receive penalties similar to the 30-day suspension and $100,000 fine the league imposed on Detroit Lions president Tom Lewand in 2010 for his driving while impaired conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell's punishment figures to be more severe. Promoted a year ago to director of player personnel, Russell was arrested Saturday evening after he rammed his Toyota Tundra truck into a parked Breckenridge Police Department patrol vehicle at approximately 40 miles per hour, according to an arrest affidavit prepared by the Colorado State Patrol. According to the affidavit, Russell's breath alcohol content measured at 0.246 - more than three times the legal limit. He had an open bottle of peppermint schnapps in his truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell and Heckert have expressed remorse in statements. Team president Joe Ellis said Tuesday his &quot;expectation is the discipline will be severe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey Steinberg, the attorney who represents both Russell and Heckert, had no comment Wednesday.5.Five Beatles songs you might be surprised to hear Paul McCartney play live By Lavanya Ramanathan, The Washington Post</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul McCartney mines the Beatles archive. Here, he performs in Washington in 1990. Illustrates MUSIC-MCCARTNEY (category e), by Chris Richards (c) 2013, The Washington Post. Moved Thursday, July 11, 2013. (MUST CREDIT: Washington Post) (Rich Lipski)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the moment Paul McCartney, coolly holding his iconic, beat-up Hofner bass guitar, plucked the first notes of the &quot;Out There&quot; tour kickoff in Brazil, the audience must have recognized something momentous was happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was playing &quot;Eight Days a Week,&quot; the 1964 rocker that is one of the Beatles' most memorable No. 1 hits. And yet, until that show, the song, penned by McCartney and John Lennon, had never been played onstage. Lennon thought &quot;Eight Days a Week,&quot; which the group struggled to write, was &quot;lousy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's one of a handful of never-performed Beatles treasures that McCartney exhumed for his &quot;Out There&quot; tour. The nearly 40-song set list starts almost every night with &quot;Eight Days a Week,&quot; then slips in four more rarely performed numbers from the Beatles catalog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of songs the Beatles never played in concert is longer than you might think. The band's last ticketed performance was in August 1966, but the Beatles experienced their most fruitful years as songwriters after that, releasing &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967), the double-album &quot;The Beatles&quot; (1968), &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (1969) and &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970) before McCartney left the Beatles in 1970. It's difficult to know why McCartney has chosen them, but these are five rarely performed Beatles tunes that have turned up consistently on the &quot;Out There&quot; set lists:---show more'Eight Days a Week'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Lennon-McCartney tune, which kicks off with a rollicking drum roll, was released abroad on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; but became a smash when it was released as a single stateside. There are a few dueling tales about where the title came from, but a popular one suggests that a driver told McCartney he had been working eight days a week.---'Lovely Rita'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A psychedelic little come-on (or, more likely, a sarcastic kiss-off) to a meter maid, the 1967 song off &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; was sung by McCartney and featured a curious interlude with instruments made of paper and combs. McCartney has been including the tune in the middle of his set.---'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lennon wrote this whirling carousel of a tune after being inspired, he would say, by an elaborate carnival poster he picked up in an antique shop. The song appeared on &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; and featured an unusually heavy assist from legendary Beatles producer George Martin, who added the track's carnival-esque sounds. On the album, it's Lennon who sings &quot;Mr. Kite.&quot;---'Your Mother Should Know'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This 1967 number, written and performed by McCartney, was released on &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and is an homage of sorts to the Busby Berkeley musical, although also a perfect example of the dreamy, hazy sound the Beatles had adopted.---'All Together Now'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chants of one-two-threes and A-B-Cs make this nursery rhyme-like 1969 number off &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; insanely catchy. McCartney has confirmed that the ditty in fact was written for children, mostly by him, with some contribution from Lennon. It's also one of a handful from the Beatles catalog that has been licensed for commercials, making it recognizable to fans everywhere.)6.Flash flooding threatens some roads in Brookline By Reformer staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BROOKLINE (AP) - The latest round of flash flooding in Vermont has threatened several roads in the town of Brookline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State police say a large beaver pond upstream from a road was breached, causing a large amount of water to rush downstream and overwhelm a small stream in the area early Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say Hill Road has been closed between Grassy Brook Road and Kirsch Road for an undetermined amount of time for repairs. Grassy Brook Road just south of the intersection of Hill Road, near the old Brookline School, will be open to a single lane of travel until a bridge that was overrun with water can be examined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI (AP) - Police and city leaders in Florida say they have taken precautionary steps for the possibility of mass protests or even civil unrest if George Zimmerman is acquitted in the killing of unarmed teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, particularly in African-American neighborhoods where passions run strongest over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, officials in Sanford and South Florida have been working with pastors, youth coaches, community activists and summer camp counselors to stress a non-violent approach if Zimmerman walks free. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, police say they have quietly been making plans for dealing with any potential emotional flare-ups that could quickly turn into storefront-smashing, car-burning riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all right to be vocal, but we don't want to be violent,&quot; said the Rev. Walter T. Richardson, a longtime pastor and chairman of Miami-Dade County's Community Relations Board, which has been holding town hall-style meetings about the case. &quot;We've already lost one soul and we don't want to lose any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin, from the suburb of Miami Gardens, was 17 when he died. He was in Sanford visiting his father and father's fiancee when Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, fatally shot him during a physical confrontation in a gated community in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's supporters portrayed the shooting as racially motivated, while Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, claimed self-defense. Charged with second-degree murder, Zimmerman is pleading not guilty at the trial unfolding in a Sanford courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After police initially refused to arrest Zimmerman, there were many large but peaceful protests in both Sanford and the Miami area - as well as in New York and other cities. Those demonstrations included a mass walkout at nearly three dozen South Florida high schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in Sanford say they doubt the trial's outcome would spark local residents to take to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main focus was to get Zimmerman arrested and have him tried before a jury of his peers in a court of law,&quot; said Clayton Turner Jr., president of the Seminole County branch of the NAACP. &quot;That was the main issue, not how we felt about whether he's innocent or guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone is so certain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shantree Hall, 37, a lifelong Sanford resident who is black, said a Zimmerman acquittal might anger many in the African-American community who already feel they are less likely to obtain justice. The protests that led to Zimmerman's arrest taught many people that was the only way to get things done, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Trayvon, the noise was too loud for them. That's why they couldn't sweep it under the rug,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent Miami-area high school graduate Jude Bruno, 18, said he doesn't sense from friends and peers that there is a powder keg in South Florida waiting to explode should Zimmerman be found innocent. Bruno is chairman of the Miami-Dade County Youth Commission, which has been working with local youth groups to stress a peaceful reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to be the example to the world because the whole world is watching us,&quot; Bruno said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruno spoke after a Community Relations Board meeting this week that drew several hundred people to a Miami Gardens library auditorium, some of them wearing &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; T-shirts and many asking sharp-edged questions about the trial. Still, the overall theme was peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please, no violence. We don't want any violence. None,&quot; said Miriam Martin, one of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's aunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One potential advantage mentioned by several law enforcement officials: school is out for summer, meaning there is no ready-made rallying point for young people to gather.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the trial of George Zimmerman, charged with second-degree murder for the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, nears its end, the swirl of media that has followed every sound clip, scrap of evidence, and testimony in the proceedings has once again put media on the hot seat for the way they handle high-profile legal cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the reporting has often elbowed key international stories out of the way, such as the ongoing Egyptian political crisis, there is much hand-wringing - also in the media - about tabloid-style overkill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arianna Huffington, founder of the Huffington Post, tweeted &quot;Wall-to-wall Zimmerman trial coverage doesn't seem like the best way to honor Trayvon's memory.&quot; Mark Knoller, White House correspondent for CBS, also tweeted, &quot;Zimmerman Trial is a legitimate news story, but national wall-to-wall coverage seems excessive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the flip side are those who suggest that such widespread exposure of the criminal justice system is a good thing, providing a real-time civics lesson for the American public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people are unaware of how the legal system works and what really happens at a trial, says Larry Burriss, journalism professor at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. &quot;Thus the coverage, and commentary, have provided what I think is an important educational function,&quot; he adds via e-mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The media has many roles in educating the public,&quot; agrees Georgia attorney Lance LoRusso, author of &quot;When Cops Kill.&quot; &quot;They can also entertain and inflame the public,&quot; he says, &quot;but in general people are very interested in the law, especially when it comes to the use of deadly force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, he says the legal system itself encourages a high level of attention in cases that result in death. &quot;When a person is killed at the end of a confrontation, he not only loses his life but his civil liberties under our system of justice,&quot; he notes. &quot;So there is a great deal of scrutiny of anyone who takes a life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obsession with blow-by-blow analysis sidesteps any meaningful discussion of race relations in America, says Julian Chambliss, associate history professor at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Media pundits are quick to point to hints of success and or failure, but these positions are doing little to address the fundamental tensions around racial assumptions that play in the background of the trial,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of tackling the deeper themes, the trial coverage predictably focuses on the tabloid-esque elements that will drive ratings for commercial media, says Maurice Hall, communications professor at Villanova University in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The initial storyline that captured our attention about an innocent 17-year-old victim and a hard-charging community vigilante has morphed into a more nuanced narrative about two troubled young men whom fate brought together for a tragic meeting,&quot; he says via e-mail. The events from that night have the element of mystery and uncertainty, he says, that are so familiar to regular viewers of media staples such as &quot;CSI.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unclear who attacked whom first, and it is unclear whether the fatal shot marked a moment of self-defense or murder,&quot; he says. &quot;The parade of witnesses, as diverse as they are compelling, add to the sense that we are watching an unfolding mystery narrative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At minimum, this courtroom trial has something for everyone, even if their minds are already made up, says Richard Goedkoop, retired communication professor at La Salle University in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implications of issues of race, crime, and violence have made the trial a simmering topic on the television and cable news agenda, he says. This continuous reporting allows viewers to look at elements of each day's coverage to confirm those views, he says. &quot;Others who may be unsure,&quot; he continues, &quot;can place themselves in the minds of the jurors weighing each piece of evidence and determining the credibility of each side's witnesses as they contradict each other,&quot; he says via e-mail, adding that it is predictable summer programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fewer people are watching their sets,&quot; he says, &quot;and with the dearth of soap operas on the small screen, here is a tragic substitute.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Some legal analysts say prosecutors were not confident of their case for second-degree murder in the Trayvon Martin shooting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three weeks of testimony ranging from wrenching to bizarre, Seminole County Court Judge Debra Nelson agreed to allow a six-woman jury in the George Zimmerman murder trial to consider convicting Mr. Zimmerman of manslaughter, a lesser charge than the initial second-degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court will give the instruction on manslaughter as a Category One,&quot; Judge Nelson said, in a significant development on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it's not unusual for prosecutors to try to hedge their bets, some criminal justice experts say the move indicates that the state has doubts that the jury would find that Zimmerman shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed teenager, out of ill will or spite, the foundation of a second-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution isn't &quot;blind to the fact that they haven't proven second-degree murder,&quot; Florida defense attorney Jose Baez, who successfully defended Casey Anthony against capital murder charges for allegedly killing her own daughter, told USA Today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second-degree murder conviction could mean life in prison for the 29-year-old former neighborhood watch captain. A manslaughter charge in Florida carries up to 30 years in state prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury will return to Seminole County Court in Sanford, Fla., at 1 p.m. to begin to hear closing arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial has captivated much of the nation, being the closing chapter of a parable about racial stereotyping, gun rights, and societal crime fears. Trayvon, who'd had some trouble in school but had never been arrested, was returning from a convenience store with candy and a drink when he, according to testimony, told a friend on the phone, Rachel Jeantel, that a &quot;creepy, white, kill-my-neighbors cracker&quot; was following him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting sparked massive protests after Sanford, Fla., police refused to arrest Zimmerman, saying his self-defense claim couldn't be countered. The racial specter that still hangs over the case is the question of whether police - and society - would have reacted the same way had an armed black man pursued a white teenager, and then shot him dead after a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, authorities have stepped up riot control planning amid fears that a not-guilty verdict could spark unrest. (Sanford is the city that ran Jackie Robinson out of town during spring training in 1946, as he began his bid to break Major League baseball's race barrier.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorneys, Mark O'Mara and Don West, introduced witnesses this week who testified about intentions and justifications during the brief encounter between Zimmerman and Trayvon, which began when Zimmerman pegged the teenager as suspicious and began following him on a rainy February night in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis Root, a private eye, testified that Zimmerman was a poor fighter who may have run out of options as Trayvon straddled him, punching down at his face. Zimmerman's nose was dislocated and the back of his head was cut before he pulled out a Kel-Tec 9 mm and fired it at close range at Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by Mr. O'Mara whether Zimmerman had any other choice, Root said, &quot;I don't believe he did.&quot; But he answered a prosecutor by saying that, in general, Zimmerman had &quot;other options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such testimony, as well as testimony from a black former neighbor about Zimmerman's interest in stopping crime in the neighborhood, may have undermined the state's strongest contention: that Zimmerman profiled, pursued, confronted, then killed Trayvon out of malice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a charge is hard to prove in a case in which the two people are strangers, and many legal experts suggest that the state has struggled to make that charge stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the broader question for the jury is the extent to which Zimmerman bears responsibility, if any, for Trayvon's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, prosecutors trying to prove &quot;ill will&quot; are relying on tape recordings of 911 calls from Zimmerman describing &quot;punks&quot; who &quot;always get away&quot; before police arrive. &quot;George Zimmerman thought he knew Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but he did not know Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; State Assistant Attorney Richard Mantei told the court last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hoodie sweatshirt shielding his head from a steady rain, Trayvon was walking back to the home where his dad was staying in the Retreat at Twin Lakes gated neighborhood when Zimmerman spotted him, began to follow him, and called a nonemergency police number. Asked by the dispatcher whether he was following Trayvon, Zimmerman said yes. &quot;We don't need you to do that,&quot; the dispatcher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not long after, eyewitnesses reported two people fighting and yelling. Then, a loud shriek and a single gun shot was recorded on a 911 call. The mothers of Zimmerman and Trayvon each testified that it was her son who screamed for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury is expected to begin deliberations Friday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believe it or not, some people actually didn't find Season 1 of &quot;The Newsroom&quot; to be an exercise in televisual waterboarding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Sorkin's idealistic HBO drama series about a fictional cable news network played to a relatively small but loyal core weekly audience of around 2 million viewers, including avid notables such as Dan Rather, Brian Williams and Arianna Huffington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might not know that, though, because they were drowned out by a vitriolic throng of critics who practically found themselves dry-heaving with each passing episode. A sampling of the venomous adjectives used to describe the show: &quot;Sexist,&quot; &quot;sanctimonious,&quot; &quot;condescending,&quot; &quot;self righteous,&quot; &quot;ponderous,&quot; &quot;preachy,&quot; &quot;smug,&quot; &quot;overwrought&quot; -- and probably a few we can't print. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were some of the slams warranted? Absolutely. The left-leaning Sorkin, who seems incapable of easing off the gas pedal, did, indeed, recklessly veer into overindulgence way too often. And his much-maligned female characters, including executive producer Mackenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer) did, at times, seem to come off as love-struck ninnies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But was &quot;The Newsroom&quot; really as horrendous as the booming chorus of hate-watchers made it seem to be? No. Not even close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now comes Season 2 and the prospects of a fresh start. In recent interviews, Sorkin has addressed some narrative nips and tucks that he hopes will appease the naysayers. But the Oscar-winning writer also knows it's foolish to allow them to be his only guide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're playing a dangerous game if you write to try to change people's minds,&quot; he said in a candid interview with the Hollywood Reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show's nine-episode second season finds pugnacious anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) in boiling hot water after labeling the tea party as the &quot;American Taliban&quot; on the air. In fact, he's stirred up so much of a stink that his boss, Charlie Skinner (Sam Waterston), is contemplating pulling Will off ACN's 9/11 anniversary coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As usual, &quot;The Newsroom&quot; relives real-life news events through the eyes of its quixotic reporters. The new season covers the period from August 2011 to November 2012 and touches upon the Occupy Wall Street movement, Trayvon Martin, drone strikes, Benghazi and, of course, the primaries and general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's a fictional plot line inspired by the 1998 &quot;Tailwind&quot; incident that apparently will provide much of the season's narrative thrust. Fueled by a mysterious tip, fill-in producer Jerry Dantana (Hamish Linklater) zealously looks to score a big story that accuses the U.S. military of a massive war crime. The story leads to legal trouble for the network, which turns to a whip-smart First Amendment attorney played by Marcia Gay Harden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, yes, there are improvements. The four episodes presented to critics make nimble use of a new narrative structure that relies on flashbacks to suss out the details of this story and how the network might have bungled it big time. Also, Sorkin appears to have toned down the rants just a bit and is being a little less heavy-handed when it comes to those messy workplace romances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Sorkin is Sorkin, and you can't separate the writer from his work. That means the earnest, rat-a-tat speechifying is still there, along with the manipulative touches and the simplistic high-mindedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the latter, one early subplot has producer Jim Harper (John Gallagher Jr.) taking leave to cover the Romney presidential campaign and heroically standing up to brutish Romney staffers who repel tough questions as they go about pushing their generic talking points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though this story line will surely elicit cheers from some, there is a moldy and mean-spirited feel to it. Moreover, the naive notion that Jim would be the only one on the campaign bus with any shred of journalistic integrity is enough to make your eyes roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line on Season 2 of &quot;The Newsroom&quot; is that it's unlikely to sway viewers one way or another. Devotees will continue to embrace it, and the haters will continue to hate. Sorkin just has that polarizing effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for this critic, let's just say that I'd rather watch an energetic, well-acted, provocative show that aims high and sometimes falls short, than one that doesn't aim high at all. Television is filled with way too many of the latter, and there's really no time for that.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WANNA-BE COP George Zimmerman opted not to take the stand Wednesday as the defense rested in his second-degree murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No,&quot; Zimmerman replied when Judge Debra Nelson asked him if he intended to testify in his own behalf. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered when the judge asked if this was his final decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that, defense attorney Mark O'Mara asked Nelson once again to acquit Zimmerman, arguing that prosecutors failed to prove he deliberately killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson said no and that she would leave it for the jury to decide 29-year-old Zimmerman's fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors could get the case as early as Friday, after both sides make their closing arguments in a racially charged case that has transfixed much of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors contend Zimmerman is a vigilante who profiled Martin and tailed him against a dispatcher's advice before killing the unarmed black teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Zimmerman, who ran the neighborhood watch at the townhouse complex outside Orlando, was frustrated over a recent rash of break-ins and over his thwarted career as a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyers say he shot Martin in the chest in self-defense after the teen jumped him and began pounding his head on the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the most surreal moments of the trial, O'Mara straddled a life-sized dummy Wednesday and smashed its head on the courtroom floor while the jury looked on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would the injuries on Mr. Zimmerman, the back of his head, be consistent with someone doing this on cement?&quot; O'Mara asked John Root, a public safety consultant who was on the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then O'Mara slammed the dummy's flopping head on the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think so,&quot; Root replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How about this?&quot; O'Mara asked. &quot;How about someone resisting the attack? Could that have come from if someone was resisting me pushing down like this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe so,&quot; Root said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crystal Wright: The real tragedy in the African-American community is our own violent neighbourhoods, yet hardly anyone talks about that <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the George Zimmerman murder trial heads towards its conclusion this week, race hastaken center stage. Since last year when Zimmerman allegedly killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in self-defense, the mainstream media joined by so called black activists injected a racially charged narrative into the case. You know &quot;racist&quot; white man profiles and kills black kid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, this trial wouldn't be receiving wall-to-wall national media coverage if Zimmerman was black. That's what we should be talking about. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Startling statistics reveal that between 1980-2008, African-Americans were six times more likely than whites to be victims of gun violence and seven times more likely to kill with guns than whites, according to the Justice Department. African-Americans represent a mere 13% of the US population yet more than 50% of federal prisoners are black. You can claim racial bias in the judicial system, but that doesn't explain all of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why aren't so-called black leaders outraged and marching over therecent shooting rampage in Chicago. During the 4 July holiday weekend, including the Wednesday leading up to it, 62 people were wounded by gun violence in Chicago and 12 others killed. The holiday shooting spree raised Chicago's homicide tally to 200 for the year. Last year about 500 people were killed, and most of those killing and being killed in Chicago are black. According to the Chicago Tribune, &quot;blacks make up about 33% of the city's population, they accounted for nearly 78% of the homicide victims through the first six months of 2012&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the mainstream media's national attention on the Zimmerman murder trail, I think it's stunning that scant, if any, attention was given to the violence raging in Chicago or other cities across the country. As I've said many times during this case, Americans, especially black Americans, have come to accept blacks killing other blacks as normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a white person is accused of killing a black person, African-Americans seem to care more and cry racism, allowing race baiting voices like Al Sharpton, whose a reverend as much as I'm a Democrat (hint: I'm not), to organize marches and rallies. The same is now true when a non-white like Zimmerman is accused of killing a black 17-year-old like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Last year blacks even got the news media to basically convict Zimmermanas a racist murderer in the court of public opinion before the trial even began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Barack Obama got in on the act, stoking the racist flames before any facts were revealed, &quot;If I had a son he'd look like Trayvon&quot;. Yet Obama has been a lot less vocal on the killings in Chicago, the city from which he hales and served as both an Illinois state senator and US senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragedy is that blacks who are shouting about racism aren't offering real solutions, especially to the violence issue in African-American neighborhoods. Interestingly,Senator Mark Kirk (an Illinois Republican) has a plan to end gun violence in Chicago. Since 15-year old Hadiya Pendleton was murdered in January in Chicago after performing at Obama's 2013 inaugural, Kirk has been pushing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and federal prosecutors to crack down on gang violence related to drugs, which police believe is driving the gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirk, a Republican, wants the FBI to prosecute these gang related crimes at higher rate given that about 18,000 people belonging to the Gangster Disciple gang, one of the most notorious gangs in Chicago (and beyond). Gangster Disciple stretches into 28 states and amasses more then $100m a year by selling drugs. And that's what we know about. In a meeting with Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy in June, the police superintendent told Kirk more than 100,000 gang members live in Chicago. As Kirk tried to tackle gang violence in his home state of Illinois, Representative Bobby Rush, a black Democrat representing the 1st district of Illinois for 20 years, which includes Chicago, railed against Kirk's plan as &quot;upper middle class, elitist, white boy solution&quot;. Well, &quot;the white boy&quot; conservative is coming up with solutions while blacks like Rush and Ali stoop to calling conservatives of all colors heinous names when they highlight or offer solutions to the ills disproportionately harming black Americans. I have also been accused of being an &quot;oreo&quot; for merely stating the fact that more blacks are killing and being killed than any other race. Today the main people holding blacks back as a race and taking them back to the days of Jim Crow are blacks themselves. Self appointed black leaders, advocacy groups like the NAACP and black members of Congress cry racist at every turn. Beyond this battle cry, they have no solutions to offer blacks a way towards greater economic prosperity and less violent lives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns: Illinois has become the last state in the union to allow citizens their full Second Amendment rights, and officials in the murder capital of America worry about the consequences of citizens defending themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois' legislature on Tuesday voted to let gun owners carry concealed weapons. The action followed a violent and bloody Fourth of July weekend in President Obama's hometown during which 74 people were shot and 12 were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permission for concealed carry in Illinois was prompted by a ruling late last year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago. It found that Illinois' law, the most restrictive in the country, violated the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The court ultimately gave the state until July 9 to rewrite it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois had the most restrictive gun laws in the nation. Still, the carnage in some neighborhoods of Chicago made it safer to walk the streets of Kabul, Afghanistan. Local officials, such as Mayor and former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, blame guns coming in from outside the city. Yet crime rates in the suburbs and downstate have been lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murders in Chicago are down from 500-plus in 2012, but the pace is still averaging one a day. City officials who place blame elsewhere do not explain why Chicago's murder rate of 15.65 per 100,000 people looks nothing like America's overall 4.2, the Midwest's 4.5 or Illinois' 5.6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a jobless rate over 10% in a city that has lost population and business, and where the majority of inner-city births are to single mothers, opportunities for young black males, other than joining a street gang, are scarce. While city fathers blame guns, the fact is that up to 80% of Chicago's murders and shootings are gang-related, according to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By one estimate, the city has 68,000 gang members, four times the number of cops. A police audit last spring identified 59 gangs and 625 factions -- mostly on the south and west sides -- none of which is going to submit to efforts like universal background checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law as approved by the legislature permits anyone with a firearm owner's identification card who has, unlike gang-bangers, passed a background check and undergone 16 hours of gun-safety training -- longest of any state -- to obtain a concealed-carry permit for $150.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police expect up to 300,000 applications in the first year as Illinois and Chicago citizens seek to exercise their Second Amendment right to self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WBBM Newsradio's Bernie Tafoya reports that Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy says the concealed-carry law is fraught with problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You say concealed carry, I say Trayvon Martin, and look at the results there,&quot; McCarthy said, referring to the shooting death of a Florida teen last year by George Zimmerman, a member of the community watch where the shooting took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with this analysis is that, based on the evidence so far, the Martin shooting appears to be a case of self-defense by an armed citizen under assault and in fear for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, crime rates and gun homicides have fallen off sharply since the 1990 s as concealed-carry laws spread nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compared with 1993, the peak of U.S. gun homicides, the firearm homicide rate in 2010 was 49% lower. There were also fewer deaths while the nation's population grew -- a trend that's continued even as gun- ownership has soared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have seen no gunfights at the O.K. Corral among armed citizens, and the sites of mass shootings such as in Aurora, Colo., have one thing in common -- all occurred in gun-free zones not unlike Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now let's see what happens to gun-crime rates in the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois when citizens are able to shoot back. Everywhere else, more guns have meant less crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">984  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense in the George Zimmerman trial rested its case on Wednesday after days spent walking the jury through the foundation of his self-defense claim: his visible injuries, the mechanics of the fight and the contention that he was crying for help on a 911 recording.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, who is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, did not take the witness stand, a signal that his lawyers are confident that prosecutors have not overcome reasonable doubt in the case. Asking a defendant to testify is fraught with risk and, in this case, is mostly unnecessary. <BR>The jury has already heard from Mr. Zimmerman, whose many statements to the police about the shooting were recorded and played in the courtroom, as was a televised interview that he gave to Sean Hannity. <BR>After the defense's last witness left the courtroom, Mr. Zimmerman was asked by Judge Debra S. Nelson whether he had come to a decision on whether he would take the stand. <BR>&quot;After consulting with counsel,&quot; Mr. Zimmerman said, his decision was &quot;not to testify, your honor.&quot; <BR>In a news conference after court recessed on Wednesday, Mark O'Mara, Mr. Zimmerman's lawyer, said his client had wanted to take the stand. <BR>&quot;You know, a big part of him wanted to get in front of the jury and talk to them and say, 'This is what I've done and this is why I did it,' &quot; Mr. O'Mara said. &quot;It was a very difficult decision for George to make.&quot; <BR>In the end, Mr. O'Mara said, Mr. Zimmerman listened to his lawyers, who had advised against it. <BR>Under Florida law, prosecutors must prove that Mr. Zimmerman did not shoot Mr. Martin in self-defense on Feb. 26, 2012. That is a high bar in a case in which the defendant - the sole survivor of an encounter that no one clearly witnessed - contends that he feared being killed. <BR>Defense lawyers also chose not to tell the jury about a toxicology report showing small amounts of marijuana found in Mr. Martin's body. Mr. O'Mara said in the news conference that he decided not to bring up the marijuana because he has tried to balance defending Mr. Zimmerman without needlessly tarnishing Mr. Martin's memory. <BR>&quot;It didn't seem to be significant enough,&quot; Mr. O'Mara said of the toxicology report. <BR>With both sides having rested, the judge announced that the state had called 40 witnesses and the defense had called 19. The prosecution will present its closing statements Thursday, with the rest of the statements concluding Friday. <BR>Robert Zimmerman, Mr. Zimmerman's father, was the last person to take the stand for the defense on Wednesday. He recounted that he was asked by the police to listen to a recording of a 911 call in which a voice could be heard shouting for help during the fight that night. The police then asked him if he recognized the voice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told them absolutely; it was my son, George,&quot; Mr. Zimmerman said.  <BR>Over four days of testimony, the defense tried to convince the jury that Mr. Zimmerman shot and killed Mr. Martin only because Mr. Martin was on top of him, punching him and slamming his head into concrete. Mr. Zimmerman told the police that he feared for his life. Mr. Martin was unarmed as he walked back to the house in the gated community where he was a guest.  <BR>Prosecutors said Mr. Zimmerman, the volunteer neighborhood watch coordinator, &quot;profiled&quot; Mr. Martin, a black 17-year-old who was wearing a hoodie and walking in the rain. They contend that he pursued Mr. Martin and began the confrontation that ended in the teenager's death. Although the issue of race rarely entered the proceedings, the case was propelled initially by civil rights leaders who viewed the handling of the case by the police as unjust.  <BR>To bolster its case, defense lawyers called a widely known expert in forensic pathology, who stated that the trajectory of the bullet and Mr. Zimmerman's injuries were consistent with Mr. Zimmerman's account of how the struggle unfolded. The lawyers also put on the stand nine people who identified the voice on the 911 call as Mr. Zimmerman's. Relatives of Mr. Martin, however, said it was his voice on the recording.  <BR>Tracy Martin, Mr. Martin's father, also was called to testify. Two police officers testified that two days after the shooting Mr. Martin said it was not his son screaming for help. But on the stand Mr. Martin told the jury that the police were wrong. Mr. Martin said he told the police that he could not tell whether it was his son's voice.  <BR>About two weeks later, after he heard the recording of the 911 call again in the Sanford mayor's office, where his family had gathered in private to listen to it, Mr. Martin identified it as his son's voice.  <BR>Despite the fact that the defense called about half as many witnesses as the state, Mr. Zimmerman may have benefited from the testimony of several prosecution witnesses who appeared to bolster his self-defense claim.  <BR>On Wednesday, the defense also got the chance to remind the jury that Mr. Zimmerman's town house development had experienced a rash of crime. This prompted Mr. Zimmerman to set up the neighborhood watch program, they said.  <BR>Olivia Bertalan testified that on Aug. 3, 2011, she was home with her baby when she saw two young men ringing her doorbell. They left and then came back. She ran upstairs and called the police. The youths came into her house, and as they rattled the doorknob of her son's bedroom, she cowered in the corner, her baby in one hand and a rusty pair of scissors in another, she said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the youths, a resident, did not enter the room, but stole her laptop and camera elsewhere in the house, and then left. He was later arrested and released because he was a minor. After she moved out, she received a letter saying he had been rearrested.  <BR>The day of the home invasion, Mr. Zimmerman came by to see how she was doing. He later brought her a second lock for her sliding glass door.  <BR>&quot;I was very appreciative,&quot; Ms. Bertalan said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former manager with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was sentenced to more than 19 years in prison Thursday for orchestrating a $30 million bribery and kickback scheme that authorities called historic in scope. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan called Kerry Khan's conduct, which included wiretapped conversations describing a planned sexual encounter with a teenage girl, &quot;shocking, vicious and cruel.&quot; The judge imposed a sentence four years longer than what prosecutors wanted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unmistakable setback for George Zimmerman, the jury at the neighborhood watch captain's second-degree murder trial was given the option Thursday of convicting him on the lesser charge of manslaughter in the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson issued her ruling over the objections of Zimmerman's lawyers shortly before a prosecutor delivered a closing argument in which he portrayed the defendant as an aspiring police officer who assumed Martin was up to no good and took the law into his own hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Department spokesman Glen Johnson said Thursday that doctors have determined that the 74-year-old Heinz Kerry suffered a seizure at the couple's home in Nantucket last weekend, but the precise cause of the seizure has not been determined.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the arrests Thursday after an undercover operation that included officers from 16 states, three federal agencies and three Asian countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Items seized under &quot;Operation Wild Web&quot; include the pelts of endangered big cats such as the Sumatran tiger, leopard and jaguar; live migratory birds such as the California scrub jay; whale teeth; elephant and walrus ivory; and a zebra pelt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever happens in the George Zimmerman trial, it has produced a valuable and profound dialogue in America about some important issues surrounding race and justice, fear and aggression, and legal guilt and moral culpability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That conversation is about people's right to feel suspicion and fear and whether those feelings need be justified to be real. It is about the degree to which suspicions and fears are culturally constructed, or at least culturally influenced, are innate or are born of personal experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More specifically, it is about how race, age and gender might influence our threat responses, and whether that is acceptable. For instance, as a thought experiment, reverse the race and ethnicities of Trayvon Martin and Zimmerman and see if that has any effect on your view of the night's events. Now, go one step further and imagine that the teenager who was shot through the heart was not male but female and ask yourself again: does it have any effect on how you view the facts of this case? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we acculturated to grant some citizens the right to feel fear while systematically denying that right to others?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That conversation is about the particulars and vagaries of laws. It is about a law that allows an ''aggressor'' to legally use deadly force against a defender if the two become engaged in an altercation where the aggressor begins to ''believe'' he or she is in imminent danger of being seriously hurt or killed. Do we want our laws to be written in such a way? Should the ''aggressor'' pay no legal penalty for setting deadly events in motion? Should the idea of self-defense bounce back and forth between two people like a Ping-Pong ball?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation is also about the legal realization that when you are killed, not only do you die but so does your version of the events that led to your death. It must be reconstructed -- to the degree that it is possible -- through the eyes of witnesses and the rigors of science, but when your body falls still, your voice falls silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases like this are about proving or disproving the story of the killer, the only story that survives. Were his actions justified or not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This creates an automatic imbalance in which the survivor has the advantage. There is an African proverb that goes something like this: Until the lions have their historians, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, by extension, the conversation is about whether each of us has a moral responsibility -- laws notwithstanding -- to do all we can to prevent a tragedy like the one that occurred in Sanford. Regardless of who initiated the physical altercation between Martin and Zimmerman, the two never had to come into close contact. If Zimmerman had stayed in his vehicle and not pursued the teenager, Martin would have made it home for the second half of the N.B.A. All-Star Game he had been watching and today he would be one year older.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technically, only Zimmerman is on trial, but in the broader debate, particularly among people who think Zimmerman innocent, is Martin also on trial? And if so, does that mean that all teens who look and behave similarly to Martin are also on trial? What precedent, if any, would a not-guilty verdict set?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if you believe that the teenager at some point during the night's events did something wrong -- the defense contends that he ''sucker punched'' Zimmerman, banged his head on cement and pummeled his face -- that teenager is now paying the ultimate price for those alleged mistakes. Does that mean that the person who shot him is guiltless and deserving of no legal punishment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should ''not guilty'' as charged (if that were to be the verdict) be read the same as ''without guilt'' in general? Is there some moral space in which Martin can, as the defense contends, be solely responsible for his own death?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation is about people's emotional investment in a version of events and a particular verdict, and why that investment has racial and ideological leanings. It's about the likelihood of one verdict over another. The bar for finding of guilt is particularly high here. The defense doesn't need the jury to see its client as completely innocent, just not completely guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the conversation is about how to respond responsibly to a verdict that many court watchers believe is likely to be less than second-degree murder, if in fact guilt is found at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is quite a bit of talk -- by local authorities, irresponsible individuals and institutions -- about the possibility of rioting in the case of a not-guilty verdict. The Broward County Sheriff's Office has produced a public service announcement urging any potential protesters to ''raise your voice and not your hand.'' Rush Limbaugh said last week that the media were ''agitating for race riots'' in the case. Sean Hannity had Mark Fuhrman, of O.J. Simpson trial infamy, on his Fox News show to discuss the possibility of riots. And The Washington Times conducted a poll recently asking, ''Will there be riots in Florida if George Zimmerman receives a not-guilty verdict by a jury of his peers?'' As of the publication of this column, three-quarters of respondents said ''yes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely, there has been riot talk on social media, and local law enforcement should plan for all possibilities, but media speculation and predictions about it can start to sound like desire rather than defusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't think of a more fruitless and self-destructive exercise than rioting. Protests have power, but rioting drains that power away. Justice is sometimes a journey. It doesn't always lead to where you think it should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case may produce a verdict some people don't agree with. But it has also produced a conversation that has weight and merit. All energy -- even anger -- should be funneled into extending that conversation and focusing on the factors that necessitated the case in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence took Martin's life. We shouldn't let violence also mar his memory in death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The defense rests. And whether George Zimmerman is guilty of second-degree murder for the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin is something we'll leave to the only folks qualified to judge: the jurors who have sat through the case and listened to the lawyers and witnesses for both sides.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not everyone may be so inclined. Of late, the speculation in much of the media has been that acquittal for Zimmerman could spark civil unrest. In this regard, remarks made on CNN by Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith that he &quot;fears&quot; violence have been quoted widely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But also out of context. In fact, the new chief has been doing just what someone in his situation ought to be doing: walking the neighborhoods of Sanford, talking to residents, reaching out to clergy and coordinating security plans with local sheriffs. It's also worth noting that when he did tell CNN about his fears of violence, what worried him was not the reaction in Sanford but of &quot;people from outside of the community coming in&quot; to stir things up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chief's observation is a good one. In the early days of this case, before Zimmerman was arrested, we did see some ugly things - including a tweet by filmmaker Spike Lee disclosing what he (incorrectly) thought was the address for George Zimmerman's parents. As with Lee, the hints of violence came from outside Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short, George Zimmerman has been fully prosecuted. The jury will soon decide whether the state has made its case. And with Chief Smith we believe the citizens of Sanford are more than capable of dealing with the jury's verdict absent the intervention of those from the outside hoping for trouble.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An expert on gunshot wounds hired by the defence in an explosive American case has told a court a neighbourhood watch volunteer&quot;s account of how he fatally shot an unarmed black teen is consistent with the forensic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Vincent Di Maio said the bullet&quot;s trajectory and gunpowder on Trayvon Martin&quot;s body support George Zimmerman&quot;s version that Martin was on top of him when Zimmerman fired his gun into Martin&quot;s chest. The gun&quot;s muzzle was against Martin&quot;s clothing and between 5cm and 10cm from Martin&quot;s skin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is consistent with Mr Zimmerman&quot;s account that Mr Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,&quot; said Di Maio, the former chief medical examiner in San Antonio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pathologist also said it was likely Martin was conscious for 10 to 15 seconds after the shooting as a reserve supply of oxygen ran out of his body, and during that time it was possible for him to have moved his arms. Zimmerman&quot;s account that he had placed Martin&quot;s arms out to his sides after the shooting contradicts a photo taken after the shooting that shows Martin&quot;s arms under his body. Defence lawyers contend Martin moved his arms. Di Maio said cuts on the back of Zimmerman&quot;s head were consistent with his head striking a concrete pavement. Di Maio identified six separate impacts to Zimmerman&quot;s face and head. He said a nose injury could have come from being punched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said if clothes taken into evidence are wet and put in plastic bags, not paper bags, it can ruin the samples since &quot;bacteria multiplies and you get mould and it stinks to high heaven&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence lawyers believe DNA evidence found on Martin&quot;s hooded sweatshirt and undershirt was degraded since the clothing wasn&quot;t packaged properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson postponed her decision on prosecutors&quot; request to bar the defence from showing animation depicting the fight between the pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors object to the animation, saying it isn&quot;t an accurate depiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To recreate the fight, Daniel Schumaker said, he went to the crime scene and had employees in motion-capture suits re-enact what happened based on coroner photographs, police reports, the coroner&quot;s report, witness depositions and photos taken by responding police officers. The fight happened on a dark, rainy night in February last year and no eyewitnesses saw the entire fight. Several people saw and heard parts of the struggle that left Martin dead with a bullet in his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony in previous days has focused on a police call that captures screams from the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convincing the jury of who was screaming for help has become the main aim of prosecutors and defence lawyers because it would help jurors evaluate Zimmerman&quot;s self-defence claim. Relatives of both protagonists have offered conflicting opinions on who is screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s mother and uncle said last week it was Zimmerman screaming, while Martin&quot;s mother and brother also took the witness stand last Friday to say the voice belongs to Martin. Martin&quot;s father this week testified he initially couldn&quot;t tell if the screams came from his son, but later decided they did. Zimmerman said during a police interview the screams didn&quot;t sound like him, but he and his family later said the screams were his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has denied second-degree murder and says he shot Martin in self-defence during a scuffle in the townhouse complex where he lived. Martin was visiting his father and his father&quot;s fiancee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) An expert on gunshot wounds hired by the defense testified Tuesday that a neighborhood watch volunteer&quot;s account of how he fatally shot an unarmed black teen is consistent with the forensic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Vincent Di Maio said that the trajectory of the bullet and gun powder on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot;s body support George Zimmerman&quot;s version that Martin was on top of him when Zimmerman fired his gun into Martin&quot;s chest. The gun&quot;s muzzle was against Martin&quot;s clothing and it was anywhere from two to four inches from Martin&quot;s skin, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman&quot;s account that Mr. Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,&quot; said Di Maio, the former chief medical examiner in San Antonio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was unarmed when he was fatally shot by Zimmerman in February 2012 in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Martin was black and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic; some activists argued that the initial delay in charging Zimmerman was influenced by Martin&quot;s race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pathologist also said it was likely Martin was conscious for 10 to 15 seconds after the shooting as a reserve supply of oxygen ran out of his body, and during that time it was possible for him to have moved his arms. Zimmerman&quot;s account that he had placed Martin&quot;s arms out to his sides after the shooting contradicts a photo taken after the shooting that shows Martin&quot;s arms under his body. Defense attorneys contend Martin moved his arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Di Maio testified that lacerations to the back Zimmerman&quot;s head were consistent with his head striking a concrete sidewalk. Later, when looking at photos of Zimmerman&quot;s injuries taken the night of the shooting, Di Maio identified six separate impacts to Zimmerman&quot;s face and head. He said a nose injury could have come from being punched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Di Maio also explained that if clothes taken into evidence are wet and packaged in plastic bags, and not paper bags, it can ruin the samples since &quot;bacteria multiplies and you get mold and it stinks to high heaven.&quot; Defense attorneys believe DNA evidence found on Martin&quot;s hooded sweatshirt and undershirt was degraded since the clothing wasn&quot;t packaged properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the morning, Judge Debra Nelson considered prosecutors&quot; request to bar the defense from showing animation depicting the fight between Martin and Zimmerman. After hearing more than five hours of arguments, Nelson said she would issue a ruling on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors object to the animation, saying it&quot;s an inaccurate depiction and will confuse jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys called the man who created the animation to testify. To recreate the fight, Daniel Schumaker went to the crime scene and had employees in motion-capture suits re-enact what happened based on coroner photographs, police reports, the coroner&quot;s report, witness depositions and photos taken by responding police officers, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight took place on a dark, rainy night in February 2012 and there were no eyewitnesses who saw the entire fight. Several witnesses saw and heard parts of the struggle that left Martin dead with a bullet in his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys also tried to get Martin&quot;s text messages and a Facebook posting dealing with fighting introduced as evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s attorneys called computer analyst Richard Connor to read to the judge text messages he found on Martin&quot;s cellphone in which he purportedly recounted a fight he had been in to a friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors were out of the courtroom as defense attorneys presented their arguments about the text messages. Nelson had ruled that information about Martin&quot;s interest in guns and fighting couldn&quot;t be used during opening statements, but she had left open the possibility that they could be introduced later. The judge said she would rule Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor John Guy said jurors shouldn&quot;t be presented with the text messages and photos of a gun found on Martin&quot;s phone, as well as a Facebook posting from a half-brother asking Martin when he was going to teach him how to fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would mislead the jury and be prejudicial,&quot; Guy said. &quot;It doesn&quot;t tell us about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and certainly doesn&quot;t tell us what George Zimmerman knew about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, defense attorney Don West said they were relevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It relates to his physical capabilities, his knowledge of fighting,&quot; West said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony in previous days has focused on a police call that captures screams from the struggle between Martin and Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convincing the jury of who was screaming for help on the tape has become the primary goal of prosecutors and defense attorneys because it would help jurors evaluate Zimmerman&quot;s self-defense claim. Relatives of Martin&quot;s and Zimmerman&quot;s have offered conflicting opinions about who is heard screaming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s mother and uncle testified last Friday it was Zimmerman screaming, while Martin&quot;s mother and brother also took the witness stand last Friday to say the voice belongs to Martin. Martin&quot;s father testified Monday that he initially couldn&quot;t tell if the screams came from his son, but later decided they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman himself once said during a police interview that the screams didn&quot;t sound like him, though he and his family later said the screams were his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and says he shot Martin in self-defense during a scuffle in the townhome complex where he lived. Martin was there visiting his father and his father&quot;s fiancee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors contend that Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, was profiling Martin and perceived the teen as someone suspicious in the neighborhood, which had been the site of a series of break-ins. The case sparked protests because police did not charge Zimmerman for 44 days and it touched off a nationwide debate about race and self-defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES (AP) Ryan Coogler is back on the University of Southern California campus for the first time since becoming one of the country&quot;s most promising young filmmakers, and he heads straight to the camera-rental center where he worked as a student. He runs into a former classmate, who high-fives and congratulates him, then asks for a photo. Coogler sheepishly obliges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is inspiring, right here!&quot; the younger man says as he snaps an iPhone shot of himself and Coogler. &quot;Thank you, bro!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler gives the student his email address, then looks for his old boss, the equipment manager, who tells the 27-year-old filmmaker that he&quot;s set a new standard for success at USC&quot;s film school, which counts Ron Howard and George Lucas as alumni. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There&quot;s no doubt he has. Coogler&quot;s &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; his first dramatic feature and first project since graduating with a master&quot;s degree in 2011 won both jury and audience awards at the Sundance Film Festival, where the Weinstein Co. outbid a dozen studios to distribute it. Originally called simply &quot;Fruitvale,&quot; the film opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles, and around the nation later this month. Oscar buzz has already begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nothing like that was on Coogler&quot;s mind when he decided to make the film. A native of Oakland, Calif., he was home for Christmas break during his first year at film school when 22-year-old Oscar Grant was shot by transit police in the city&quot;s Fruitvale station on New Year&quot;s Eve, 2009. Scores of witnesses filmed the fatal shooting of the unarmed black man by white officer Johannes Mehserle on their cellphones, and riots and protests exploded in Oakland and around the country. (Mehserle was eventually convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two years behind bars.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler was also 22 then, looked like Grant and came from the same neighborhood. It could have been him that night, he thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to do something that could potentially have a proactive effect, that could maybe trigger a thought process or a discussion that could possibly prevent things like this from happening in the future,&quot; he said. &quot;And I thought a film could be effective in proving this person&quot;s humanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler has the athletic build of the football star he was, and a gregarious personality that leads him to greet several students he passes on campus. But there&quot;s something deeper: A profound desire to tell stories that aren&quot;t often heard, stories of people like him, like Oscar Grant. It&quot;s a passion that inspired him to abandon dreams of medical school to pursue filmmaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It&quot;s that drive, along with Coogler&quot;s talent, that caught the eye of USC professor Jed Dannenbaum, who contacted producer Nina Yang Bongiovi, telling her there&quot;s someone she had to meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He&quot;s truly brilliant,&quot; Bongiovi remembers the professor saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She met with Coogler, and he gave her some short films he&quot;d made at school. She watched them immediately and told collaborator Forest Whitaker, who&quot;d been seeking a young artist to mentor, that they just had to work with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt he was going to be one of those important filmmakers of his generation,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She set up a meeting between the Oscar winner and the college student, who remembers wearing a shirt and tie to school that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was really nervous,&quot; Coogler said, recalling how he attended the meeting between classes and had to bring his backpack along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Whitaker his ideas for &quot;Fruitvale,&quot; &quot;&quot;and he said he wanted to help me make it,&quot; Coogler recalled, lighting up at the memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After signing on with Whitaker&quot;s Significant Productions, the filmmaker approached Grant&quot;s family in the same humble, open-hearted way he dealt with his classmates at USC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was my first time making a film; I didn&quot;t want to hide that,&quot; he said. &quot;I was young; I was the same age Oscar would have been had he still been alive, but I thought those things were in my favor in many ways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler wasn&quot;t looking to sensationalize anything. As a young, black Oakland resident who saw himself and his friends in Grant, Coogler sincerely wanted to reflect his neighborhood and the people he knew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wasn&quot;t trying to do this to further my career,&quot; he said. &quot;I just wanted to tell the story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So with the family&quot;s blessing and Whitaker&quot;s support, he did, recounting the last day in the 22-year-old&quot;s life. The film shows his struggles with his girlfriend and his prison past; his illuminating love for his young daughter and desire to be a good dad; his devotion to his mom and grandmother; his penchant for drug dealing and angry outbursts; and how much he meant to those closest to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale&quot; is not a documentary, but a dramatization based on court documents, cellphone footage and extensive interviews with Grant&quot;s family and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like we put different values on different types of lives, just inherently, and I think people like Oscar, their lives have very little value. (We) see things like this happen all the time and don&quot;t bat an eyelash,&quot; Coogler said. &quot;But these people are human beings, and their lives matter. And what better way to get to the bottom of who he was than through the lens of (his) relationships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael B. Jordan, best known for his work on &quot;The Wire&quot; and &quot;Friday Night Lights,&quot; embodies his first leading role as the charming and conflicted Grant. Grant&quot;s mother is played by Octavia Spencer, who also hopped on board as a producer, securing financing from investors including &quot;The Help&quot; author Kathryn Stockett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case is playing out while this film hits theaters underscores the need for more stories like this, Coogler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who look like Oscar, who look like Trayvon, are dying every day on the streets of our country not only being shot by a police officer or not only being shot by somebody using vigilante tactics, but oftentimes being shot by someone that looks just like them,&quot; he said. &quot;These lives matter, and we shouldn&quot;t just stand by while this is happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering how much his life has changed since he left USC he&quot;s made an award-winning film, attended the Cannes Film Festival and is invited to ever more Hollywood events makes Coogler even more cognizant of his blessings and responsibilities as a storyteller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He still lives in Oakland, maintains his day job at Juvenile Hall in San Francisco and hopes to continue &quot;to make things that are true to myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I&quot;m constantly reminded where my life could be were it not for a few things, were it not for the parents that I had, or me being two inches here instead of two inches there sometimes,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&quot;t think it&quot;s something I ever plan to forget.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) Closing arguments were set to begin Thursday in a U.S. murder trial that raised issues of race and self-defense gun laws over a deadly confrontation between a neighborhood watch volunteer and an unarmed black teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman&quot;s defense attorneys rested their case Wednesday. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, saying he shot Trayvon Martin in self-defense during a nighttime scuffle in February 2012 in his gated community, where Martin was visiting family. Zimmerman did not testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge said the case could be sent to jurors late Thursday or Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case drew national protests after some civil rights activists argued that the 44-day delay in arresting Zimmerman was influenced by Martin&quot;s race. Martin was black and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors have seen repeated video recordings of Zimmerman telling his side of the story to police investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One key question has been whether it was Martin or Zimmerman heard screaming for help on a police call that captured their fatal fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys called Zimmerman&quot;s friends, parents and uncle to testify that it was Zimmerman screaming. Martin&quot;s mother and brother had testified that it was Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determining who screamed would help jurors evaluate Zimmerman&quot;s self-defense claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor John Guy also used a life-sized foam mannequin in front of the jury to simulate the body positions of Zimmerman and Martin at the time of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Mark O&quot;Mara told reporters that Zimmerman wanted to testify but his attorneys felt he had already told his version of events in multiple police interviews played for jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think he really wanted to be able to interact with this jury and say to them &quot;This is what I did and this is why I did it. And as importantly, this is what was happening to me at the time that I decided to do what I had to do,&quot;&quot; O&quot;Mara said. &quot;So in that sense, yes, I think he wanted to tell his story.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I live in a gated community in Ormond Beach. I have known about the black bears being seen in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have stopped leaving my bird feeders out at night, as two of them have been destroyed, along with the shepherd's hooks they were hanging on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One morning last week, at 9:40 a.m., I watched a bear run into my yard and proceed to destroy the shepherd's hook and pull the feeder to the ground. The bear sat down and made himself at home while I watched from my porch and took pictures. My yard is very small, and on any given day I could have been in my yard working. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand the bears are protected, but I do not understand why they are allowed to roam free in a small community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to me the residents shouldn't have to worry about a bear walking into the yard during daylight hours. I will not be feeding the birds any longer, much to my dismay. I also hope I don't have to watch a bear in my yard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encounters of the rude kind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 1, I was driving down Riverside Drive, going south toward Edgewater to pick up prescriptions. The speed limit on that road is 25 mph, and that was my speed. There was a pickup truck behind me following close, with two young men in it. When I slowed down to make a right turn, the driver of the truck quickly went into the left lane. There was another automobile coming north, and he almost ran into it. This could have had disastrous consequences involving three automobiles. To put it mildly, I was very upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the two young men had some kind of emergency and needed me to get out of the way, I would like to apologize if I was driving too slowly. But in return, I would appreciate an apology from them for the middle-finger salute they gave this 72-year-old woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am sure that if their mother or grandmother had been in the car with them, those women would have been appalled by their behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time I have seen this happen, and it's always young men who do it. One of these days they're going to use that &quot;salute&quot; to the wrong person andup in the hospital. There is so much hate and nastiness in the world today -- I wish that everyone would wake up in the morning and be thankful to be alive and try to do something nice for somebody, instead of driving around with chips on their shoulders. Life is short. Play nice!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I just wanted to share with you and your readers a funny, but true encounter I recently had while waiting in line at a local grocery store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was standing next in line to check out, and this poor woman in front of me took out a food stamp card to pay for her items. I only know this because she had asked the cashier which button to push before swiping her food stamp card. I sort of felt sorry for this woman, for being in such dire straits and having to use this welfare card just to make ends meet. Just then, I heard a soft noise being emitted from the purse in her cart. It was a kind of electronic melody, but I couldn't recognize the tune. Regardless, this poor woman reached into her purse and ... pulled out a $700 iPhone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all due respect and empathy for the Zimmerman and Martin families, there are other matters of concern to the public -- like unemployment, the economy, health care, civil rights, education, etc. Why must the public be invited to share personal details of the participants' lives?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE -- Gov. Rick Scott said Thursday law enforcement across Florida is ready for &quot;whatever happens&quot; after the verdict as the second-degree murder trial of George Zimmerman gets closer to wrapping up in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury might begin deliberations in the racially charged case as early as Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got great sheriffs, police chiefs, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, I've been in contact with them, they're ready for whatever happens,&quot; Scott said during a morning appearance on WPEC TV in West Palm Beach. &quot;But hopefully the right thing happens here, and we'll have a verdict that everybody understands.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of agencies, including the FDLE, have been coordinating potential responses with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office and the Sanford Police Department, which have been the lead agencies since the February 2012 shooting by Zimmerman of Trayvon Martin, a Miami Gardens teen who was staying with his father in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Volusia County Sheriff's Office is watching developments in Sanford, said spokesman Brandon Haught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are constantly monitoring what's going on and are in regular contact with our fellow law enforcement partners there,&quot; Haught wrote in an email. &quot;We are ready to assist or react as the situation warrants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orange County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Ginette Rodriguez said, &quot;We're assisting if they need us for anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger said Sanford-area law enforcement requested the state assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As always, we will assist local law enforcement if they request any assistance,&quot; Plessinger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, most agencies, such as the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, are monitoring the case but don't expect any local public backlash whichever way the jury rules. A spokeswoman for the Florida National Guard also said no directives have been made to be on alert with the verdict pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office said it is not releasing details, other than to repeat that the agency continues to ensure adequate staffing and resources are in place and that there will be support from multiple local, state and federal agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Broward County Sheriff's Office has created a public service announcement intended to convince people to remain calm if Zimmerman is acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video, which features two teenagers, a Hispanic female and a black male, and members of the Sheriff's Office, tells the public, &quot;Raise your voice, and not your hands! We need to stand together as one, no cuffs, no guns. ... I know your patience will be tested, but law enforcement has your back!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Martin's family attended a town hall meeting Tuesday at the North Dade Regional Library where the possibility of violence was discussed. A member of the Martin family has also set up a Facebook page to urge people to conduct peaceful protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami-Dade Police Deputy Director Juan Perez told WFOR TV in Miami that plans have been discussed to avoid a riot similar to the 1980 race riots in Liberty City that followed the death of Arthur McDuffie, an insurance salesman and former Marine who was beaten to death by a group of white Miami police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to reduce the chance for post-verdict violence may be to set up zones for people to protest, Perez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think now we've come a long way as a community and as law enforcement in merging together and bridging together our resources,&quot; Perez told the television station.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year ago, black leaders and activists took to the streets throughout Florida and the nation to protest the Sanford police department's investigation of the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and push for the prosecution of neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the jury in Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial expected to start deliberating Friday, many of those same leaders -- church elders and community activists -- are now joining hands with law enforcement officials in Sanford, South Florida and elsewhere to urge people to remain calm if Zimmerman is found not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been spending a fair amount of time trying to figure out what our role should be in this, how to keep the peace and if it turns out the worst-case scenario what our next moves should be,&quot; said Derek Turner, spokesman for the NAACP, which coincidentally is holding its annual convention this weekend in Orlando, not far from the trial. &quot;We're all in the back of our minds waiting on edge to hear a verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who is half-Hispanic, shot Martin, a hoodie-wearing black 17-year-old who was unarmed, on a drizzly Feb. 26 night in a gated community near Orlando. Citing Florida's stand-your-ground law, however, Sanford police originally did not charge Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after social media outrage and civil rights protests alleging racial profiling and discrimination did Gov. Rick Scott appoint a special prosecutor, who brought the charges against Zimmerman six weeks after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense before and during trial has been that he fired the gun in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around-the-clock television coverage of the trial has heightened anticipation about the verdict, and anxiety by some about what the reaction will be to it. Authorities have tagged more than 1 million tweets per day related to the trial as it reaches its climax this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel released a video this week pleading with people to &quot;raise their voices, not their hands&quot; and to remain calm. Israel and his staff met with black pastors and community leaders on Tuesday to enlist their aid in avoiding violence after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no reason to believe there are going to be any issues but forewarned is forearmed,&quot; Israel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Miami Gardens, where Martin lived with his mother, Sybrina Fulton, police, lawyers and community leaders also held a pre-emptive forum this week, as they did throughout Miami-Dade County, where the 1980 acquittal of four Miami-Dade police officers in the death of Arthur McDuffie sparked riots in Overtown and Liberty City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw's office has been monitoring the trial, as well as what other agencies are doing, but he does not anticipate problems and has no special plans for the verdict, spokeswoman Teri Barbera said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're keeping our lines of communication open with our community leaders, our civic activists, the members of the clergy, as well as our local, state and federal agencies,&quot; she said. &quot;We're ready to react if necessary but I don't know that we feel that it's imminent at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott's office is &quot;in contact with law enforcement throughout Florida to ensure they have the resources needed to keep Floridians safe,&quot; governor's spokeswoman Melissa Sellers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, Police Chief Cecil Smith is intensifying outreach in black neighborhoods and the U.S. Department of Justice will be on hand after the trial ends, Mayor Jeff Triplett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Department officials have worked with Sanford officials since last year to try to ease race relations, Triplett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that there were no arrests and no violence at last year's peaceful demonstrations when hundreds of protesters, led by Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, marched through Sanford's streets to demand the arrest of Zimmerman, Triplett said he doesn't anticipate any problems now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said, &quot;You always have the anxiety of these butterflies in your stomach of the 'what ifs.' I would hate to think it would take on a different vibe than what we've seen in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens, has participated in community meetings. He said there may be more peaceful demonstrations but riots are &quot;a thing of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that we're past that type of action. I do believe there will be an outcry if people feel that justice wasn't served,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People have seen actual movement and results from the type of actions they did in the beginning of this Trayvon&nbsp;Martin issue. So I think people will revert back to that, protests, walk-outs, things like that if there's a verdict they don't feel is serving justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP has facilitated about 10 town hall meetings throughout the state, including in Tampa, Jacksonville and Fort Walton Beach, and is working closely with local law enforcement officials and church leaders, said state NAACP president Adora Obi Nweze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that if we do our work on the front end, that our communities will definitely work to keep the kind of calmness and peace while dealing directly with the issue head on,&quot; Nweze said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The family has called for peace. It just would not work to our best advantage to get justice if we interfere with justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimmerman's trial for many blacks represents inequities beyond his individual case, &quot;we can't make the whole issue of race relations depend on it,&quot; Nweze said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an appearance on Sharpton's MSNBC show Wednesday evening, Crump joined Sharpton in appealing for calm following the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(The family) have always prayed for and asked for peaceful gestures ... because if they can accept the rule of law, then they (others) should be able to,&quot; Crump said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W. Kamau Bell isn't comfortable revealing his age. &quot;It's not a big deal,&quot; the comic and social critic recently said on the phone from New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not hiding my age. . . . I'm not worried about it.&quot; So how old is he? He doesn't say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who is cocreator and host of FX's topical comedy show Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell, will be in town for a night of stand-up Friday at Prince Music Theater in Center City. The 8 p.m. show also will feature Janine Brito, Kevin Kataoka, and Aparna Nancherla.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cocreated by Chris Rock, Totally Biased blends elements of stand-up, news commentary, and talk show. It was launched to critical and popular acclaim in September 2012 as a weekly show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such has been the praise that when it returns in September, it will be revamped as a nightly show on FX's new sister channel, FXX. (It'll be on at 11 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, with a weekly best-of compilation Sunday nights, also at 11.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was gracious on the phone. Funny, relaxed, but also reflective. He wondered if it's useful for reporters to refer to him simply as a comic or as an African American comic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing's for sure: He pays attention to the news, which he dissects on his show with nimble mind- and lingo-power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of him as a cross between Keith Olbermann (he's not afraid to express outrage at political stupidity) and Chris Rock (he's got a rare ear for language and great comic timing). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's work first came to prominence in 2010 with his one-man show The W. Kamau Bell Curve: Ending Racism in About an Hour. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics dubbed him one of the country's best political comedians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was nonplussed by the label. &quot;Every time a black man has an opinion, he's a political activist,&quot; he joked. &quot;I was anointed a political comedian because I was doing jokes about the guy who's running for president. So I was told, 'Hey, well you are a political comedian.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's observational comedy is political in the larger sense, hitting on such issues as race, poverty, and terrorism. &quot;I feel the word sociopolitical fits better - how society is inter-connected,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell traces his interest in politics, especially race relations, to his family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like it was always part of the discussion in my house,&quot; he said. &quot;Every month was Black History Month at our house.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell grew up in Alabama and Chicago, the son of Walter Bell, a self-made man who rose from bank teller and insurance salesman to become Alabama's insurance commissioner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother is author and memoirist Janet Cheatham Bell, who began her career in the school textbook industry in Boston before founding a self-publishing firm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did they name him Kamau? &quot;It's a Kenyan name, but I'm not sure if that's even their heritage,&quot; Bell said. &quot;I was born at a point when black people felt the revolution was coming, so they named their kids after African names.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell graduated from the prestigious University of Chicago Laboratory Schools before moving to Philly to attend Penn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he misses the city, and Wawa hoagies, Bell didn't exactly fall in love with Penn, and left after three semesters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My major was East Asian studies,&quot; he said, &quot;because I was really into Bruce Lee. That was my first mistake.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell felt like an outsider because &quot;there was no real vital arts scene&quot; at Penn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just realized this is not my place, this is not my scene,&quot; he said. He moved to Los Angeles and threw himself into comedy, building up an impressive resum&amp;eacute;: He cofounded the collective Laughter Against the Machine; cohosts a podcast with Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid called The Field Negro Guide to Arts &amp; Culture, and released two albums, including 2010's Face Full of Flour. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success of The W. Kamau Bell Curve put him on the map. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Rock came calling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He saw the show in New York and called me a few weeks later and said, 'I want to help you get a TV show,' &quot; Bell said. &quot;I was like, Yeah? . . . Yeah!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show spelled a life chance for Bell, who was married, with a baby. His wife Melissa is working on a Ph.D. in contemporary dance theory. Their daughter, Sami, is now 2. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Totally Biased premiered during the 2012 election season, which gave Bell, an avowed liberal, plenty of material. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he tries to show there is bias in all reporting. &quot;It's bias if one story gets more attention than others,&quot; he said. We need to start asking tough questions about the media, he said. Such as why celebrities get more coverage than some wars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or why did the Paula Deen scandal get equal footing with the murder trial of George Zimmerman for shooting Trayvon Martin?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both were given a lot of attention, which creates this false equivalency,&quot; Bell said. &quot;I think my job as a commentator is to point this out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added the comic, &quot;If Deen called me every day and dropped an N-bomb with me and no kid died in that process, I would be perfectly happy. We don't need to be covering Deen. There's real news out there.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  W. Kamau Bell: &quot;The Totally Biased Stand-Up Tour&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 p.m. Friday at Prince Music Theater, 1412 Chestnut St. Tickets: $22.50, $25. Ages 18 and up. Information: 215-893-1999 or www.princemusictheater.org</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- After taking less than a week to call 18 witnesses, George Zimmerman's defense attorneys rested their case Wednesday in the neighborhood watch volunteer's second-degree murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors and defense attorneys planned to work out the jury instructions before presenting closing arguments today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman never testified. But jurors saw repeated video recordings of him telling his side of the story to investigators. He claims that he shot Trayvon Martin, who was unarmed, in self-defense while the 17-year-old youth straddled and punched him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman Sr., was the last witness called by the defense, and he said it's his son yelling for help on a 911 call that captured sounds of the fatal fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walgreen's health law push</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Walgreen, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, agreed to join with the largest federation of health insurers to promote the Affordable Care Act, lending a hand as the Obama administration strains to win over the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, comprising 38 state and local health plans including 14 owned by WellPoint, said Wednesday that it will set up an educational website with Walgreen and distribute information in the retailer's 8,000 stores. The campaign is aimed at encouraging people without insurance to use the government exchanges to shop for subsidized health plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement may provide a lift two weeks after the National Football League threw water on the idea of becoming a partner with the Obama administration, which has struggled to sell the law's benefits amid roadblocks by Republican opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-pilot qualifications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The amount and type of flying experience first officers -- also known as co-pilots -- must have to qualify to fly for an airline will be significantly increased and expanded under new regulations announced Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations require first officers to have at least 1,500 hours of flying experience. Airline captains are already required to have at least 1,500 hours. Previously, first officers were only required to have 250 hours of flight time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rule also requires first officers to have an aircraft-type rating, which involves additional training and testing specific to the type of airplane they fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police/fire sex scandal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAKELAND, Fla. -- Authorities are investigating a widespread sex scandal involving nearly a dozen police officers in this Florida city after a civilian crime analyst detailed trysts with the men in police and fire stations, patrol cars, motels and even in a parking lot after a memorial service for a slain officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sue Eberle, 37, has told officials that she had consensual and sometimes coerced sex with the officers and a firefighter, and that she once was propositioned by a city worker in Lakeland. Ms. Eberle's accounts of the liaisons were largely corroborated by her sexual partners and others within the police department, and published in a graphic, 59-page report written in an incredulous tone by the county's top prosecutor. It said the department's problems investigating crimes might be caused by some high-ranking officers being more interested in having sex with Ms. Eberle than doing their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in the nation ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Navy conducted a historic flight test Wednesday off the coast of Virginia when an experimental bat-winged drone made an arrested landing aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time. ... The Pentagon is eyeing plans to eliminate danger pay for service members in as many as 18 countries and five waterways around the world, saving about $120 million each year while taking a bite out of troops' salaries, The Associated Press has learned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, &quot;stalked&quot; him and started the fight that led to his death, prosecutors asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the testimony of nearly every witness for the prosecution bolstered Mr. Zimmerman's claim he acted in self defense, said attorney Andrew Branca, author of &quot;The Law of Self Defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's case was so weak that Judge Debra Nelson should have granted the defense motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, said Mr. Branca, who is covering the trial for the blog Legal Insurrection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Zimmerman shot Martin, they were on the ground. The one on top was banging the head of the one on the bottom against the pavement. Mr. Zimmerman was on top, the prosecution contends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution's star witness, Rachel Jeantel, 19, was talking with Martin on his cell phone when the fight started, but doesn't know who threw the first punch, she acknowledged during cross examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rachel Jeantel was a train wreck as a witness,&quot; said defense attorney and blogger Jeralyn Merritt (TalkLeft). &quot;Most strikingly, she made Trayvon&nbsp;Martin out to be the profiler of Zimmerman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin described Mr. Zimmerman to her as a &quot;creepy ass Cracker,&quot; Ms. Jeantel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two employees of NBC News doctored the tape of the call Mr. Zimmerman made to the Sanford Police Department to report suspicious behavior to make it appear he had a racial motive. In fact, it wasn't until after the dispatcher asked him if he could identify the race of the person behaving suspiciously did Mr. Zimmerman say: &quot;He looks black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since prosecutors offered no other evidence of racial bias, this appears to have been the basis for their assertion Mr. Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman got out of his truck and followed Martin after police told him not to, prosecutors asserted. But he never told him that, the police dispatcher testified. He did ask which way Martin was going, which Mr. Zimmerman might have interpreted as being asked to follow him, Sean Noffke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of this evidence makes clear that Zimmerman should never have been arrested,&quot; said George Parry, a former federal prosecutor who practices law in Philadelphia. That he was &quot;is a sad reflection of the prosecution's cowardice in the face of media-spawned hysteria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of Martin was racially motivated, said most in the &quot;mainstream&quot; media. To sustain their narrative, some journalists fabricated evidence. NBC doctored the NEN tape. ABC and CBS doctored photos to make Mr. Zimmerman's injuries seem less serious. Mr. Zimmerman had uttered a racial slur, CNN claimed, when the word he had said was &quot;cold.&quot; CNN also broadcast his Social Security number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many news organizations broadcast or printed a photo of Martin when he was 12, not as he was at 17. This caused Jeannee Nanalo, who could see only that the bigger guy was on top, to tell police initially she thought Mr. Zimmerman was the aggressor, she testified. (Martin was 6 feet tall and weighed 160 lbs, the police report said. Mr. Zimmerman was 5'9&quot;. No weight was listed. A friend said he was 5'8&quot;, 170.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman's mother is Peruvian. A great-grandfather was black. He was raised in a mixed-race household. Black friends testified on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Zimmerman had Hispanicized his first name (as Geraldo Rivera did) and adopted his maternal last name, it's doubtful he'd have been arrested, much less put on trial for murder, said historian Victor Davis Hanson. Jorge Meza would have been spared this ordeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman must hope the jury has more integrity, more respect for the law and the truth than do the prosecutors, the judge and so many journalists.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla.c c&quot;Wannabe cop&quot; George Zimmerman wrongly profiled Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a criminal, followed him with a gun and provoked him into a fight that resulted in the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager, a prosecutor said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A teenager is dead,&quot; Florida state prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda told the jury in closing arguments of Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial. &quot;He is dead through no fault of his own. He is dead because another man made assumptions. Because his assumptions were wrong, Trayvon Benjamin Martin will no longer walk on this Earth.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounding indignant, de la Rionda portrayed Zimmerman as a predator, not the good citizen who, as portrayed by the defense, was attacked by a 17-year-old whose actions led to his own death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers were due to present their closing arguments on Friday, followed by a final prosecution rebuttal, after which the jury would begin deliberating a case that has captivated and polarized much of the U.S. public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time and again, de la Rionda accused Zimmerman of lying about what happened the rainy night of Feb. 26, 2012, when he spotted Martin inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman called police, saying he believed Martin was suspicious and noted that there had been break-ins in the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Martin was a guest in the home of his father's fianccce, who lived inside the gated community, and was returning from a nearby convenience store with a snack in preparation for watching the NBA All-Star game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda tried to undermine Zimmerman's claim that he was not following Martin but looking for a street address to relay to police. The prosecutor sought to reveal inconsistencies in Zimmerman's statements and repeatedly quoted him speaking in police jargon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing at Zimmerman, who was seated at the defense table, de la Rionda asked the jury to use common sense to answer the question: &quot;Do you believe there's an innocent man sitting over there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who started this?&quot; he asked. &quot;Who followed who? Who was minding his own business? And of the two, who was armed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda avoided mentioning race but said Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; Martin, suggesting he assumed Martin was a criminal because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I HAD A DREAM&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecutor also paraphrased Martin Luther King Jr. in defending witness Rachael Jeantel, a young woman of Haitian and Dominican origin who was on the phone with Martin when the teenager encountered Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeantel underscored the racial divide in the case by using what de la Rionda called &quot;colorful language,&quot; such as when she quoted Martin as referring to Zimmerman, who is white and Hispanic, as a &quot;crazy ass cracker.&quot; She also testified that Martin told Zimmerman to &quot;get off,&quot; suggesting Zimmerman initiated the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a dream that a witness was judged not by the color of her personality but by the content of her testimony,&quot; de la Rionda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering that legal analysts have generally portrayed the prosecution case as weak, de la Rionda received positive reviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has to work within the confines of what he's got, and he was animated,&quot; said Alison Triessl, a California-based defense lawyer who has followed the trial closely. &quot;I loved the question about who was the one who was really scared here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney David Weinstein of Clarke Silverglate in Miami saw the prosecutor as effective, such as when he showed the last picture taken of Martin - an autopsy photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He walked the jury through the evidence and pointed out the inconsistencies with the defense's arguments,&quot; he said. &quot;He was confident in the job that his team has done and he ended with a sympathetic tug on the jurors hearts. He was not overly dramatic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Thursday, Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson gave jurors the option of convicting Zimmerman of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Prosecutors wanted the sequestered, all-female jury to have the option of choosing a lesser offense that still carried a potentially lengthy sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If convicted, Zimmerman could be sentenced to life in prison for second-degree murder and up to 30 years for manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense preferred an all-or-nothing choice of second-degree murder, confident it had shown Zimmerman acted in self-defense and concerned the jury might opt for what lead defense lawyer Mark O'Mara described as a &quot;compromise verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman, it provoked street demonstration throughout the United States as critics blamed Zimmerman for pulling out his Kel Tec 9mm pistol, which was fully loaded with hollow-point bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backers of liberal gun laws have rallied behind Zimmerman and helped fund his defense, seeing him as a persecuted hero whose need for self-defense demonstrated the importance of the Second Amendment right to bear arms.c</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Victor Davis Hanson</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Opinion</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">710 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In ancient Athens, popular courts of paid jurors helped institutionalize fairness. If a troublemaker like Socrates was thought to be a danger to the popular will, then he was put on trial for inane charges like &quot;corrupting the youth&quot; or &quot;introducing new gods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convicting gadflies would remind all Athenians of the dangers of questioning democratic majority sentiment. If Athenian families were angry that their sons had supposedly died unnecessarily in battle, then they might charge the generals with negligence -- a warning to all commanders to watch their backs. As with Socrates, a majority vote often led to conviction, and conviction to a death sentence, or at least ostracism or exile. The courts freelanced to ensure that &quot;the people&quot; would hold sway over the perceived powerful and elite. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We in the United States are in jeopardy of turning our own criminal-justice system into revolutionary tribunals -- fanned by the media and public opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 2005 popular anger against the Bush administration over the Iraq war was at its zenith -- and in particular against the unapologetic Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and other top Bush officials. The Democrats were confident of making gains in the upcoming 2006 midterm elections, in part by attaching animus and scandal to administration grandees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't hear much any more about Scooter Libby, who was chief of staff to Vice President Cheney. But in late 2005, by a set of strange circumstances, he became a target of media anger and liberal fury. Libby was indicted by a Washington grand jury and put on trial by Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, supposedly for leaking the claimed covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know now that not only was Plame's identity probably not covert, but, if it ever had been, former Secretary of State Colin Powell's own deputy, Richard Armitage, had already leaked it. And we also know that both Fitzgerald and Powell knew that fact at the time of the trial, and yet kept silent about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libby was eventually convicted not of disclosing anything illegal about Plame, but, in the course of unending testimonies, of obstructing justice by supposedly not telling the entire truth under oath to various federal bodies. The crushed career of Libby served as a sort of national venting and warning. Once the federal court had become a revolutionary tribunal acceding to the popular will, the furor passed, the media were satiated, Libby was ruined and calm returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, media hysteria, popular anger, and ideology determine whether revolutionary courts go after someone like Scooter Libby as an enemy of the people, or ignore those in the Obama administration who lie under oath or take the Fifth Amendment. The court system has become a valuable tool of perceived social, rather than individual, justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People can disagree on the merits of the George Zimmerman self-defense case. But few serious observers believe that Zimmerman can be proved to have committed second-degree murder as charged. That prosecutorial overreach came in response to the furor whipped up by racialists like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, veiled suggestions from Attorney General Eric Holder that civil-rights violations might be prosecuted, and improper editorializing by the president about his and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's shared racial makeup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, no one knows exactly what happened on the night Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed; but given the media distortions, threats, and popular agitation, everyone knows that a revolutionary tribunal is in session to find Zimmerman guilty of murder. He has ended up a necessary sacrificial pawn to serve wider issues of social justice, or at least avoid civil violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American court system is insidiously focusing on social transformation rather than individual justice. If Neanderthal reactionaries in California twice voted to reiterate that marriage is between a man and a woman, then leave it to judges and courts to find them bigoted and politically incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty years ago we laughed at the absurdities of the O.J. Simpson trial and verdict. But that circus has proved to be the blueprint for 21st-century American criminal justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">699 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a courtroom junkie since my early reporting days, it is at great personal sacrifice that I suggest the following: It may be time to get television cameras out of the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or at least, judges might be encouraged to exclude electronic media from high-profile trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The excessive coverage and commentary we've watched in recent years may be good theater but bad for justice. Most recently, we've been witness to the carnival trial of George Zimmerman, charged in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. We've seen the families; we've met neighbors and friends; and we've heard the screaming on the recorded 911 call. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have written about all of the above, true. But here's the difference. If I were sitting in the courtroom with pad and pen, no one would notice or care. The pen may be mightier than the sword - and a picture may be worth a thousand words - but video cameras alter reality. By their very presence, they change the people and events they seek to capture. And, just to keep those cliches rolling, though seeing is believing, what we project for others to see is influenced and reality, therefore, is altered by the fact that a camera is recording that projection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've always known this on some abstract level, but our curiosity - and, ostensibly, our mighty respect for the public's right to know - has clouded our judgment. There may be no way to quantitatively prove that cameras influence courtroom behavior and, possibly, a trial's outcome. But anyone who has ever sat in front of a camera knows that it is so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the notion of the public's right to know every detail of what is essentially a show trial suffers a paucity of veracity. If our concern were truly to better understand the machinations of the judicial system, as some have argued, we would record and broadcast all trial proceedings rather than only the ones that involve key elements of modern tabloid storytelling, namely sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll - and race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman trial is riveting not because two men got in a scuffle and one of them died. It isn't even that one was a teenager and the other an adult armed with a gun. It is that one was black, the supposed victim of a profiling vigilante, and the other white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voila: We have a potboiler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine if Martin had been white under the same circumstances. Some might argue that Zimmerman would not have found Martin suspicious had he been white, but we can't know this for certain. We can debate the point until we're all blue, but meanwhile, we can be fairly certain that the trial would not have attracted a single camera if not for the race element.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point: Media are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">only</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interested in stories involving tension, whatever its underpinnings. And, inarguably, media are providing what people, too, most care about. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is pointless to blame media for essentially doing their job - providing information the public wants. Our attention, thus, would be more appropriately aimed at our own prurience and, given the human appetite for same, the court's responsibility in protecting the defendant's right to as fair a trial as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means ensuring a &quot;neutral and detached environment,&quot; as Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki put it in his ruling to ban media coverage of O.J. Simpson's civil trial. The presence of electronic media in the criminal trial - very little of which I missed, I should say - &quot;significantly diverted and distracted the participants,&quot; Fujisaki wrote, adding that &quot;the conduct of witnesses and counsel were unduly influenced by the presence of the electronic media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fujisaki also was concerned that the jury, which was not sequestered, would be influenced by outside commentary. Although Zimmerman's jury </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">is</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sequestered, the judicial environment is hardly neutral or detached. One way or another, the media's incessant dissection of every little shred of evidence or testimony leaks into the courtroom and contaminates the atmosphere. When lawyers and witnesses hear their own performances critiqued - and evidence is evaluated by one of the legions of former prosecutors-turned-experts - suddenly the audience is directing the play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put another way: If it were your neck on the line, you'd probably rather the media were in Cairo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none seemed as impossible  as bringing Octavia Spencer on board just after the actress won the supporting-actress Oscar as the sassy Minny Jackson in The Help at the 2012 Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought it was  crazy to even ask,&quot; says Coogler, 27. &quot;But my agent said she's a nice lady and she might like the script. I didn't think in a million years she was going to say yes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer stunned him by agreeing to work on the reality-based drama (opening Friday), and he realized that his victory made him even more stressed out. Coogler feared that the veteran actress with the new gold statue wouldn't follow his direction or would treat the project like a charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had these fears,&quot; Coogler says. &quot;But they melted away the moment I met her. She was 110% in from that moment. She was like a battery that got hooked up to the film, and she took it into hyperdrive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station shot into another orbit thanks to the work of Michael B. Jordan (HBO's The Wire), who plays Oscar Grant, the 22-year-old shot to death by San Francisco-area transit police in 2009; Spencer, who plays his mother, Wanda; and Forest Whitaker, who's a  producer. After winning the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in January, the movie made a triumphant international debut at the Cannes Film Festival in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The  U.S. release comes  in the midst of George Zimmerman's high-profile trial in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Though there are key differences in the incidents, the shootings feature &quot;parallels,&quot; Coogler says, including young, unarmed African-American victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt this was an important story to tell,&quot; Spencer says. &quot;We just rolled up our sleeves and did what was necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer, 43, says she had her doubts about getting involved with the project: She has no children but plays a mother who loses her son. Further, she was concerned about stepping into a racially charged issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">both sides of the man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She changed her mind after reading Coogler's script, which focused on telling the story of Grant's final 24 hours, a portrait that showed redeeming qualities and warts of the devoted family man who dealt marijuana and had spent time in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ryan wasn't showing Oscar saving babies,&quot; Spencer says. &quot;He showed Oscar as good and bad. He's flawed. It's a balanced portrayal. That's what I wanted to be behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was so drawn to the project that she told Coogler she would pay her own lodging costs during filming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She has the most intense team mentality,&quot; Coogler says. &quot;She said, 'Put that money on the screen. I'll put myself up.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the film lost key financing for its shoestring budget of less than $1 million, Spencer took on an executive-producer role and raised money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I shamelessly started calling my friends I knew had deep pockets, friends in which 25 grand wouldn't hurt. And I kicked in some of my own,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn't want any of Ryan's vision to be sacrificed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer also tapped her Hollywood pals to appear in the film, including Ahna O'Reilly, Kevin Durand and One Tree Hill's Chad Michael Murray. The latter two were chosen to play the officers most directly involved in the shooting.  The 6-foot-5 Durand had to be brought in &quot;on my insistence,&quot; Spencer says; he didn't want to be known as the guy responsible for Grant's death, even on film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told him that was why we needed him ... to bring the humanity to that officer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler says Spencer was a &quot;director's dream,&quot; never complaining during the marathon shoots, which were extended  to save money. He recalls putting the actress &quot;through the wringer&quot; in one emotional all-night shoot in which her character finds out about her son's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If I had a crystal ball ... '</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than take the next day off, as scheduled, Spencer was back  the next night. Coogler was huddling with Jordan in the company's tiny trailer when he heard laughter in the parking lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I left to see what was going on, and Octavia had all of my friends, who are extras in the film, in the parking lot making them all die laughing,&quot; Coogler says. &quot;She was just there supporting. She didn't need to be. That's what kind of person she is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan says Spencer was undaunted during a scene shot in San Quentin State Prison, where actual prisoners were used as extras. In fact, she reveled in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When (Coogler) would say 'cut,' they were hollering and hooting at Octavia and rushing over to try to talk to her. She was loving all the attention from the inmates,&quot; Jordan says.  &quot;They were crazy over her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Fruitvale's critical acclaim on the festival circuit, Spencer says, it's too early to even think about its awards potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Man, if I had a crystal ball ... ,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't know if this will take us down that road again. But I can tell you this, I'm really proud of this film.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people chasing the stories become the story in Season 2 of HBO's The Newsroom (Sunday, 10 p.m. ET/PT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of asking the questions,  news anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels) is answering them as the season opens. A lawyer (Marcia Gay Harden) is doing the probing as the cable network faces a massive lawsuit for reporting -- then retracting -- a story alleging the use of chemical weapons by the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going from hunter to target is not a comfortable position for the news team. &quot;In the first season, we were going after the Tea Party, what has kind of divided the Republican Party,&quot; Daniels says.  &quot;This is more about an incident that happens to us. Journalistically, we follow ... a very, very wrong path.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The season-long arc following the reporting of a story known as Operation Genoa is a major structural change from the first season of the drama, which follows the personal and professional lives of a team of cable television journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Series creator Aaron Sorkin found the high-stakes story he was looking for when consultants brought up CNN's 1998 Tailwind fiasco, in which the network retracted a story alleging that the U.S. military used nerve gas against American defectors in Laos during the Vietnam War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a problem with the story. People got fired and people had to resign,&quot; says Sorkin, who created The West Wing and won an Oscar for writing The Social Network.  &quot;I needed to update it and fictionalize it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Genoa story unwinds, The Newsroom will continue examining real news events from the recent past. The opener picks up in August 2011, just a week after the first-season finale, and runs through election night in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Newsroom will look at such stories as Occupy Wall Street, the Trayvon Martin killing and the Benghazi consulate attack. And the show explores the political campaign when senior producer Jim Harper (John Gallagher Jr.) decides to ride the Romney campaign bus  to avoid an awkward situation with unattainable colleague Maggie Jordan (Alison Pill).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But drones and anti-terrorism policy take center stage during the season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will, who had a crisis of confidence in Season 1, &quot;begins to take on the role of (being) the big shoulders in the office,&quot; Sorkin says. And he must face fallout after referring to the Tea Party as the American Taliban. &quot;To me, the more interesting point of friction today isn't between the right and the left, it's between the right and the far right,&quot; Sorkin says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will also continues his push and pull with executive producer and former lover Mackenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer), who had cheated on him when they were involved. &quot;They absolutely love each other and can't stand each other. Just when you think this might happen, somebody says the wrong thing, and then we're in the middle of the civil war again,&quot; Daniels says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Newsroom itself was a target during its first season. The much-talked-about series drew praise but also criticism: Some saw it as too preachy or liberal, while others complained that it depicted female characters as less than serious, especially in their personal lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew it was going to be loved and hated, just because we were being political,&quot; Daniels says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sorkin sees the show as an advocate for  what journalism can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a romanticized and idealized version, just like The West Wing was (about) people who work in the White House,&quot; he says. The Newsroom &quot;is journalists as cowboys in white hats.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State prosecutors are asking the judge in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder case to instruct the jury to consider lesser charges -- manslaughter and aggravated assault -- when they begin deliberations Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's attorneys have objected, and Judge Debra Nelson will hold a hearing this morning to decide whether jurors should consider the new charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury would still have the option of convicting Zimmerman, 29, of the second-degree murder charge that prosecutors sought when the trial began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last-minute maneuvering has been seen by some legal experts as an indication that prosecutors are not as confident about their chances for a second-degree murder conviction. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, has been portrayed by prosecutors as a wanna-be cop who shot Trayvon, who is black, after a confrontation in a gated residential community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They aren't going to go all or nothing,&quot; Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney, said of state prosecutors. &quot;They aren't blind to the fact that they haven't proven second-degree murder.&quot; Baez successfully defended Casey Anthony, a Florida mother accused of killing her daughter in a capital murder case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman says he acted in self-defense after Trayvon jumped him and began beating him. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, says that race did not factor into his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second-degree murder in Florida carries a possible life sentence. If convicted of manslaughter, Zimmerman could get up to 30 years. Aggravated assault would carry no more than a five-year prison term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors have maintained that Zimmerman profiled Trayvon and assumed an unarmed teen was a threat to his community. They called 38 witnesses, including some who said Zimmerman was the aggressor and continuously played up that Zimmerman followed Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said he will argue against the lesser charges being considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Self-defense is self-defense,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;What happened out there was not a crime, so in that context, there shouldn't have been&quot; any charges. <BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was on citizen's watch years ago, and we were told under no circumstances should we get out of our car. Our job was only to observe and report. If George Zimmerman had not gotten out of his car to follow Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, none of this would have happened. A 17-year-old was walking home, minding his own business and talking on his cellphone. Then, an armed Zimmerman decided to follow Trayvon. Is this standing one's ground and asserting self-defense? I think not. Had Zimmerman stayed in his car, none of this would have happened. Zimmerman must be held responsible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, FLA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. - In the end, George Zimmerman - a man who gave his account of a tragic night to police many times and who told his story on national television - stayed silent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighborhood watch volunteer, whose February 2012 shooting of an unarmed African American teenager sparked a national uproar, opted against testifying in his second-degree murder trial. Dressed in a loose-fitting blazer, Zimmerman stood at the defense table late Wednesday and quietly told Seminole County Circuit Court Judge Debra Nelson that he'd made the decision after consulting with his attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's choice capped days of intense courtroom action before the defense rested its case Wednesday, clearing the way for closing arguments to begin on Thursday. Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though Zimmerman did not testify, jurors heard from him often over three weeks of trial testimony. They watched video and heard audio of him being questioned by police investigators. They watched him on a reenactment video recorded by police. And they saw his interview with Fox News broadcaster Sean Hannity. In effect, he was testifying to them without having to be cross-examined about his claim that 17-year-old Trayvon Martin attacked him on a rainy night and that he shot in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys concluded their case without delving as deeply as they'd hoped into Martin's past. Zimmerman's attorneys have attempted to portray Martin as the aggressor, in an effort to support their client's self-defense claim. They tried vigorously to convince Nelson that text messages about guns and fighting found on Martin's cellphone should be shown to the jury. During a marathon evidence hearing Tuesday night, Nelson walked out of the courtroom, ending the proceedings shortly before 10 p.m., while defense lawyer Don West was still arguing that he needed more time to prepare arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When court reconvened Wednesday morning, Nelson quickly ruled that the text messages would not be admitted as evidence, dealing a blow to a defense team that seemed to have a great deal of momentum after conducting punishing cross-examinations of several key government witnesses. The texts might have been used to portray Martin as a skilled and aggressive fighter. Prosecutors have emphasized that Zimmerman was heavier than Martin, a slender 17-year-old; defense attorneys called a local gym owner to testify that Zimmerman was unathletic and &quot;soft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the text messages on Martin's phone, a friend wrote, &quot;Babe, why you always fighting?,&quot; according to Richard Connor, a defense computer forensics expert who testified during the evidence hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connor testified that Martin wrote about a fight opponent, &quot;I lost the first round,&quot; a message that he punctuated with a smiley face. &quot;I won the second and third.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You need to stop fighting, for real,&quot; the friend texted back, Connor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connor also said Martin's half brother, Demetrius Martin, posted a Facebook message asking, &quot;When you gonna teach me how to fight.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys also appeared to have made a tactical decision that limited how much jurors would learn about Martin. They had successfully argued earlier this week that they could present evidence to jurors about a small amount of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, that was found in Martin's blood. But they rested on Wednesday without saying a word about THC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence concludes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence attorneys have rested their case in the murder trial of the U.S. neighbourhood watch volunteer who says he fired in self-defence. George Zimmerman declined to testify and is pleading not guilty. The death of black teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin brought protests when Zimmerman wasn't arrested for weeks, and the case has raised questions about race and self-defence gun laws. Prosecutors now plan to call two rebuttal witnesses. Both sides will then present closing arguments. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's military has the world's &quot;most active and diverse ballistic missile program,&quot; with an expanding inventory of nuclear warheads that can reach North America, according to a Pentagon intelligence report. The arsenal includes a new submarine-launched JL-2 ballistic missile that will &quot;for the first time allow Chinese&quot; submarines &quot;to target portions of the United States from operating areas located near the Chinese coast,&quot; according to the new assessment by the National Air and Space Intelligence Center.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury's decision in a former Cincinnati Bengals' cheerleader's defamation lawsuit against a gossip website could impact websites around the country, attorneys for both sides said Wednesday. Sarah Jones is seeking damages from thedirty.com and its operator over posts made in 2009 on the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based website. One post claimed she had sex with every Bengals player, and the other said she probably had two sexually transmitted diseases. She says both are false and has accused website operator Nik Richie of malice. Jones' attorney, Eric Deters, told jurors in closing arguments Wednesday they have a chance to send a message to websites across the U.S. that &quot;it's not right to defame people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. navy successfully landed a drone the size of a fighter jet aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time Wednesday, showcasing the military's capability to have a computer program perform one of the most difficult tasks a pilot is asked to do. The landing of the X-47B experimental aircraft means the navy can advance its plans to develop another unmanned aircraft that will join the fleet alongside traditional airplanes to provide around-the-clock surveillance while also possessing a strike capability. It also would pave the way for the U.S. to launch unmanned aircraft without the need to obtain permission from other countries to use their bases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is privatizing its Royal Mail postal service through a public stock offering within the next nine months. The step was expected as the British government has been giving the Royal Mail a big overhaul in preparation for going public, including paying its whopping $6.9 billion pension fund deficit and bolstering its profit. Revenue from parcel deliveries was up 13 per cent in the last fiscal year, thanks to the growing popularity of online shopping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 10--Now that the defense has rested in the murder trial of George Zimmerman, there will be a few rebuttal witnesses and then arguments by prosecutors and defense attorneys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Zimmerman's fate will be determined by the Sanford, Fla., jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of what verdict is reached and how thoughtful the jury is in reaching it, the result will be applauded by some and lambasted by others. And while the case is specific to a Florida town, its impact will be national.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undisputed fact is that in 2012, neighborhood watch volunteer Zimmerman shot and killed the unarmed Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every other aspect of the case, however, is highly disputed. Zimmerman, who was licensed to carry the gun, contends that he acted in self defense and is not guilty of any crime. Prosecutors contend that Zimmerman committed second-degree murder under Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the case has exemplified many of the divisions in America, bring into question racial profiling, gun rights, perceived biases in law enforcement and media fairness, especially in regard to editing that a television network did in broadcasting the 911 call from Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the outcome, there are no winners in this case. Martin has lost his life. Even if he is acquitted, Zimmerman's life will never be without the specter of this incident hanging over him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the societal issues that have arisen will be no more settled than they were before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with other high-profile, violent incidents involving race that have captured national attention, a major concern is how the verdict will be received. The worst-case scenario is that protests could develop that get out of hand, exacerbating an already volatile situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida officials have even taken the step of creating public service announcements featuring African-American and Hispanic individuals saying together that people should raise their voices if they want, but not raise their hands against one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear that this is a case many feel passionate about. It is just as clear that few people have found their opinions swayed by what they have read, seen and heard about the trial. Most who though Zimmerman was guilty to start with still think that, and those who decided early on he was not guilty have held firm to their opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court of public opinion, sadly, does not need actual facts to arrive at its &quot;verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a jury does, and that is something we should all want. These jurors, who have promised to be fair, have seen all the evidence and heard all the arguments. They have to arrive at a verdict based on law, not on emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emotion, however, will be felt by those closely watching the case, and it may influence reactions. We hope everyone will remember one point made in those PSAs -- a decision made in an instant can have lasting effects. In the altercation between Zimmerman and Martin, had even one decision been better made that fateful day, had one action not been taken, the results might have been much different. A teenager might not be dead today and a man might not be on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is something we should all remember, and take to heart.</SPAN></P>

(AP) - A central Florida judge ruled Wednesday that Trayvon Martin's cellphone texts on fighting and a defense animation depicting the fight between Martin and George Zimmerman won't be introduced as evidence at Zimmerman's trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Debra Nelson made her ruling Wednesday, a day after she heard arguments on the matter. Prosecutors had claimed the texts were irrelevant and taken out of context.

The strategy serves several purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On what may be the last day of testimony in the trial of George Zimmerman, who is charged with killing unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on a rainy Florida evening in early 2012, jurors are expected to hear Wednesday about the small amount of marijuana found in the teenager's blood - evidence that allows the defense to argue that pot-smoking could have contributed to a deadly encounter that eventually made news around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case in which racial tensions and contention over America's gun culture provide a backdrop, the marijuana testimony would prominently introduce another cultural flash point concerning drug use and perceptions of drug users, especially male African-American drug users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pot before shot,&quot; a Drudge Report headline proclaimed, after Florida circuit court Judge Debra Nelson reversed a previous ruling on Monday, agreeing that the defense can present to the six-woman jury testimony concerning Trayvon's marijuana use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical examiner Shiping Bao testified last week that he had concluded that the amount of THC - the psychoactive compound in marijuana - in Trayvon's body &quot;could have no effect or some effect&quot; on his behavior the night of the encounter with Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Judge Nelson's reversal, the defense has an opening to try to cast the 17-year-old's marijuana use as a moral marker - to present Trayvon not as a baby-faced boy but as a more menacing and impulsive character who may have deserved what he got for punching and beating another citizen simply trying to protect his neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that way, say criminologists watching the trial, racial stereotypes around drug use - the black, hoodie-wearing pot smoker as menacing, the white pot smoker as hapless but harmless - could blur the jury's impressions about what happened the night of the fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are only two possibilties regarding drugs: One is that that people are making the claim that marijuana made Trayvon&nbsp;Martin violent, which would be more legitimate if I'd ever once heard of stoners being violent,&quot; says Alex Tepperman, a University of Florida doctoral student whose paper &quot;Half-Baked: Weed, Race and the Demonization of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; was presented at a conference in April. &quot;The other claim is that marijuana use makes Travyon Martin immoral and suspicious, and should bring up questions about other activities in his life. In other words, who are we to attack Zimmerman for being suspicious of this morally loose young person?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents and the state of Florida say Zimmerman exhibited &quot;ill will&quot; toward Trayvon, which colored his decision to use his gun to kill the teenager, whom he had followed and confronted, believing he was a potential criminal. Travyon was returning on Feb. 26, 2012, to the home where his dad was staying in Sanford, Fla.'s Retreat at Twin Lakes, toting a bag of Skittles and an Arizona iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On trial for second-degree murder, Zimmerman told police that he shot Trayvon in self-defense after the teenager slugged him in the nose and beat his head on the sidewalk. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin caused his own death,&quot; defense attorney Mark O'Mara said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida self-defense law says a &quot;reasonable&quot; person can defend himself with deadly force if he fears for his life or great bodily harm. The state says Trayvon is the one who had the right to self-defense after being pursued by an armed stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson has barred most testimony about Trayvon's social media activities, which included diatribes about pot smoking and street fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent to which those interests mingled, however, has been the subject of widespread Internet debate, at times straying from the scientific knowledge of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House's stance against marijuana legalization, for example, leans on a tough Office of National Drug Control Policy report on the dangers of the drug, but that report does not make the case that marijuana increases violence. Nearly two-thirds of Americans ages 21 to 54 have used marijuana at least once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issue boils down to whether the Zimmerman jurors ... see that there's absolutely no credible proof that marijuana use in and of itself induces violent behavior in anyone,&quot; writes Earl Ofari Hutchinson, author of &quot;America on Trial: The Slaying of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; in a New York Daily News blog. If the prosecution can't make the case that Trayvon himself was not violence-prone, he adds, the marijuana testimony could &quot;bolster the terrifying thought the defense has worked overtime to implant, and that's that marijuana use made Martin a legitimate target.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyewitnesses have disagreed over who had the upper hand in a struggle when Zimmerman fired nearly point blank at Trayvon's chest. State prosecutors contend that Zimmerman was a wanna-be cop on a mission, pursuing, confronting, and potentially throwing the first punch at Trayvon, and then shooting the youth &quot;because he wanted to,&quot; in prosecutor Richard Mantei's words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, a pathologist hired by the defense testified that the evidence matched Zimmerman's version of events, that he was on his back being beaten when he fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman's account that Mr. Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,&quot; Dr. Vincent DiMaio, the former chief medical examiner in San Antonio, told the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution took nine days to lay out its case. Now, the defense is using a two-pronged strategy to persuade jurors that they can't convict Zimmerman. The first is that Trayvon attacked Zimmerman. The second is that Zimmerman had cause for alarm to follow Trayvon, given how the teen was acting. Zimmerman told a police dispatcher that Trayvon was acting like he was &quot;on drugs or something&quot; as he walked through the neighborhood. In that conversation, Zimmerman can also be heard saying that &quot;these [expletive] punks&quot; always get away - a phrase that the prosecution says proves that Zimmerman &quot;thought he knew Trayvon&nbsp;Martin&quot; to be a criminal, although the teenager had done nothing wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Zimmerman's decisionmaking, he has become a stand-in for broader attitudes in society about race and crime, says Mr. Tepperman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've constructed this idea of very menacing black drug users, and there's no good reason why there should be this cultural divide between the two,&quot; he says. &quot;This is how racism gets submerged in our society, and how it becomes endemic, because you can use marijuana to label someone. You can say, 'Well, it's not that he's black, it's that he's black and young and I can imagine him being involved in no-good activities.' That's an essentially racialized argument, but it can be made by people who would never self-identify as racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether such stereotypes would play to Zimmerman's benefit with the jury is uncertain, argues Doug Keene, a well-known jury consultant in Austin, Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they're trying to do is create a threatening character, and you've had testimony ... that included the specter, if not the evidence, of Trayvon having really been extremely violent toward Mr. Zimmerman,&quot; says Mr. Keene, a well-known jury consultant in Austin, Texas. &quot;Then the question becomes, why would he do such a thing, and part of the answer [the defense] is going to offer is that Trayvon was wasted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about creating a picture, developing a story that becomes more vivid for the jury,&quot; adds Keene. &quot;The prosecution's response about [the toxicology report] needs to be, 'What's your point?' The reality for a lot of high school kids is that even the ones that sing in the choir and volunteer at the nursing home also smoke weed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An expert in the mechanics of hand-to-hand combat who took the stand in the George Zimmerman trial on Wednesday testified that Mr. Zimmerman is a hapless fighter who could well have felt justified in shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dennis Root, a private eye and a former cop with a background in fight dynamics, said that in a &quot;dynamic combat event&quot; there's a &quot;golden rule&quot;: If you haven't won the fight in 30 seconds, you need to change tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The altercation between 17-year-old Trayvon and then-28-year-old Zimmerman had been under way for at least 40 seconds when Zimmerman grabbed his 9mm Kel-Tec and fired a straight shot into Trayvon's chest. Forty seconds in a fight is &quot;like a lifetime,&quot; Mr. Root, a paid defense witness, told the six female jurors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to testimony, Trayvon was straddling Zimmerman, beating down on him, potentially causing the dislocated nose and small cuts on the back of Zimmerman's head shown in police forensic photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question for the jury is whether Zimmerman was warranted in using deadly force, or whether he bears responsibility for engaging an innocent, unarmed teenager out of &quot;ill will&quot; and then fatally shooting him after he lost control of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Root acknowledged to the prosecution that Zimmerman had &quot;other options&quot; than to use his weapon, but doubted whether the defendant had the expertise to do much else to avoid further injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can sit here and come up with a thousand things that he may have been able to do,&quot; he said. &quot;But reality is what a person is perceiving to be their reality, and what his responses are for that given reality. There are always options in every force event, it's just a matter of what you as an individual see as your options.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Root acknowledged that Zimmerman had trained at a boxing gym, although he had never been deemed competent enough to face anybody in the ring. Zimmerman spent most of his time shadowboxing and grappling a sand bag. He &quot;didn't have the physical prowess to go into boxing another person. He didn't have the skill level to physically interact with another boxer,&quot; Root said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That haplessness may have factored into Zimmerman's response, he added. &quot;If I was dealing with Chuck Norris, I would expect a completely different response to any kind of physical altercation than I would if I was dealing with Pee-wee Herman,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, Root suggested that Zimmerman is more Pee-wee Herman than Chuck Norris. Earlier on Wednesday, Judge Debra Nelson barred cellphone messages from Trayvon suggesting that he was interested in mixed martial arts fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Martin was a physically active and capable person [while] Mr. Zimmerman is an individual who is by no stretch of the imagination an athlete,&quot; Root said. &quot;He would find himself lacking when compared to Mr. Martin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the encounter in February 2012, Trayvon stood 5-feet-11 and weighed 158 pounds. Zimmerman stood 5-feet-7 and weighed 185 pounds. Eyewitnesses have given contradictory accounts about which one appeared to be the aggressor in the fight. Also inconclusive is a recording of a 911 call in which a shriek of help can be heard. Trayvon's mother and Zimmerman's mother each testified under oath that she believed the voice to be that of her own son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight dynamics testimony is important for the defense, which is trying to establish that Zimmerman had no choice but to shoot Trayvon, and that, as defense attorney Mark O'Mara said, &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin caused his own death&quot; by needlessly attacking and beating George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense was moving closer to conclusion in the high-profile trial of the former neighborhood watch captain, whom the state alleges committed second-degree murder by exhibiting &quot;ill will&quot; toward Trayvon before shooting him to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before leaving the stand, Root, a veteran cop, acknowledged that Zimmerman's use of the word &quot;subject&quot; suggested that he saw Trayvon as a &quot;bad guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state alleges that another snippet of a call Zimmerman placed to 911 - about &quot;[expletive] punks&quot; always getting away - suggested that the defendant harbored ill will toward Trayvon. It is necessary to prove ill will to win a second-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in his testimony, Root told Mr. O'Mara that the sequence of events that led Zimmerman to pull his gun and shoot Trayvon did not point to ill will, but rather to an urgent desire to stop an attack in which Zimmerman, according to physical evidence, was unable to land any blows on Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida self-defense laws allow the use of deadly force to prevent death or grievous bodily injury. Prosecutors say Zimmerman waived those rights when he decided to pursue and confront Trayvon&nbsp;Martin against the advice of a police dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury may get the case by the end of the week.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what may be his last utterances in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder trial, former neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman said Wednesday afternoon he had made the decision not to testify in his own defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida circuit court Judge Debra Nelson asked Mr. Zimmerman if he had been threatened or coerced into not testifying, and the 29-year-old answered no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though not unexpected, Zimmerman's move was one of several last-minute machinations as the high-profile trial winds down, amid concerns by some law enforcement officials in Florida that a not-guilty verdict could cause civic unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, defense attorneys said they'd introduce witnesses to talk about how marijuana use by the 17-year-old Trayvon could have affected his decisionmaking on the night he was killed, but instead the defense put a &quot;use of force&quot; expert on the stand to talk about fight dynamics before resting its case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution called back Adam Pollock, the owner of a gym where Zimmerman trained, causing a minor uproar when it suggested he was using his training of Zimmerman as an advertising pitch, thus undermining the credibility of his testimony. Mr. Pollock, ironically, testified for the prosecution, causing Judge Nelson to wonder why the prosecution is trying to impeach its own witness. Pollock ultimately did not retake the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes as the case winds down are high. Now on Day 21, the trial has clarified, but not solidified, the last two minutes of Trayvon's life, when he got into an altercation with Zimmerman. The defendant had gotten out of his car to follow Trayvon after calling him &quot;suspicious&quot; and &quot;on drugs or something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case inspired widespread rallies and &quot;Million Hoodie Marches&quot; in early 2012, after Sanford, Fla., police refused to charge Zimmerman with a crime, saying they couldn't counter his self-defense claim. A special state prosecutor indicted him 44 days later. The trial began June 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sequence of events Wednesday did give some clues as to the defense's thinking as it closed its case. Firstly, Zimmerman testifying on his own behalf may have caused more harm than good, opening himself up to cross-examination about a series of alleged inconsistencies in his version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, through his lawyers, has claimed self-defense, saying Trayvon attacked him, punched him to the ground, and beat his head against a concrete sidewalk. Dennis Root, a private eye and &quot;use of force&quot; expert, testified Wednesday that Zimmerman was a hapless fighter who had few options in the heat of the battle but to use his weapon in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors say Zimmerman profiled Trayvon as a criminal, trailed him, confronted him, and then killed him when the situation turned against him. They assert Trayvon is the one who had the right to defend himself under the law after being followed for two minutes by an armed adult stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Doug Keene, an Austin-based jury consultant who has followed the case, the defense ultimately may not have made much headway by bringing up a toxicology report that showed Trayvon had a trace of THC in his system on the night he was killed. A medical examiner had said the amount may have affected his behavior, but scientific studies have failed to show that marijuana has any ties to violent behavior - unless the person is already violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge had ruled several times against introducing character evidence against Trayvon, but said she would allow more testimony on the trace marijuana because the state's own witness, medical examiner Shiping Bao, changed his mind about whether the active ingredients in the drug could have influenced what happened on the night of Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another decision may have helped the defense to rest before bringing up the pot issue: On Wednesday, the judge barred the introduction of cell phone messages in which Trayvon talked about street fighting. Without that evidence, the marijuana argument may have faltered, Mr. Keene said, given the number of teenagers and adults who report having used the drug at least once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late Wednesday, prosecutors wanted to call a new witness to rebut testimony by defense witnesses that Zimmerman &quot;was largely incapable of fighting,&quot; according to assistant state attorney Richard Mantei. The witness, a state alcohol enforcement agent, would testify that Zimmerman attacked him in 2005 during an arrest of several of Zimmerman's friends at a bar, Mr. Mantei said,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The state attorney's office dropped a battery on an officer charge to a misdemeanor,&quot; defense attorney Mark O'Mara argued back. &quot;Eight years ago [Zimmerman] was overarrested for something. It was dismissed outright. Bears no significant ... value, both because it's ancient in time, ancient in act, and the way it was handled by system suggests that it was a nonevent even to begin with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new witness may testify Thursday before both sides make their closing arguments and the six-woman jury gets the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRAYVON&nbsp;MARTIN was on top of George Zimmerman and struggling with him when the neighborhood watchman fired a fatal shot into the teenager's chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the testimony jurors heard Tuesday from famed forensic pathologist Vincent DiMaio, who said the 17-year-old was conscious for maybe 10 to 15 seconds before the oxygen ran out of his body and he died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman's account that Mr. Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,&quot; the pathologist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DiMaio - a key defense witness who has testified previously at the high profile murder trials of wife-killing cop Drew Peterson and record producer Phil Spector - was paid $2,400 and buttressed the defense argument that Trayvon was the aggressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But DiMaio conceded he couldn't say who threw the first punch. He also got the attention of two women on the jury who are involved in animal rescue when he admitted that he runs ballistics tests by shooting live animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Mark O'Mara told Judge Debra Nelson that the defense could finish presenting its case Wednesday, but did not say whether Zimmerman would testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors contend Zimmerman profiled Martin and tailed him against a police dispatcher's advice before killing the unarmed black teenager. They say Zimmerman, who ran his local neighborhood watch outside Orlando, was frustrated over recent break-ins and his thwarted career as a cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyers say he killed Martin in self-defense after the teen jumped him and slammed his head on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before DiMaio testified, a legal battle over a virtual fight erupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyers want to show jurors an &quot;Avatar&quot;-like depiction of the fatal battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors objected, saying the depiction is likely to be flawed because there were no witnesses who saw the entire fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson has not decided whether the jury will be allowed to see it.The judge is also mulling whether to allow defense lawyers to show Martin's text messages and a Facebook post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the texts, Martin purportedly recounts a fight he had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Facebook post, a half-brother asks him about fighting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report by Oklahoma Policy Institute outlines large and persistent gaps in wealth, income and opportunity between Oklahomans of different races and ethnic backgrounds. &quot;Bigotry not to blame for Oklahoma's shortcomings&quot; (Our Views, June 24) takes issue with this report. The evidence of a racial wealth gap isn't disputed. Rather, the editorial says blacks have higher rates for smoking, obesity, cancer, heart-disease mortality, incarceration and unemployment, and lower rates of education achievement, &quot;largely&quot; as a result of personal choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course our choices shape our lives. But they certainly don't shape our lives in a neat and predictable way. The adult great-grandchild of a turn-of-the-century oil billionaire can inherit a vast fortune without lifting a finger. At the same time, the great-grandchildren of survivors of the Tulsa racial violence inherit only memories of a fortune lost in a single day as hundreds of black homes, banks and businesses were set ablaze. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To believe that &quot;those acts are now history, in every sense of the word&quot; is to remain ignorant of the real and long-lasting effects of a history that enriched generations of Oklahomans by impoverishing others. Today, nearly half of the state's population younger than 5 is composed of children of color. The obstacles to opportunity still faced by so many in our state matter for all of us, whatever the color of our skin. Kate Richey, Tulsa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richey is a policy analyst with Oklahoma Policy Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race shouldn't be a factor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I disagree with Sam Mitchell's comparison (Your Views, June 30) of President Obama and George Zimmerman. Both men are biracial. Both have declared their racial preference. Declaration of one's race/ethnicity is a personal choice. However, the comparison between the two men ends there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman is on trial for his actions, which resulted in the death of Trayvon Martin. The races of the accused and of the deceased shouldn't be contributing factors in this trial to determine Zimmerman's innocence or guilt. Only the evidence and testimonies should be weighed in the search for truth. Pat Cole, Oklahoma City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A flag for all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thanks to The Oklahoman for putting the American flag on the front page July 4. Some of us still get a lump in our throat and goose bumps when the national anthem is played. We become emotional when we stand at the base of Mount Rushmore or feel a deep sense of pride and patriotism when we see a group of U.S. fighter jets flying overhead in tight formation. We're drawn to tears watching footage from World War II, Korea and Vietnam, realizing that many of the Americans being killed by the thousands weren't much more than young boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seeing The Okahoman that day, I was reminded of how lucky I am to be an American and to have been born and raised in the great state of Oklahoma. Also, I give praise to one of Oklahoma's most successful businessmen, Hobby Lobby's David Green. He doesn't cave in when his beliefs are challenged and he's put his money where his mouth is many times. Mr. Green, thank you for the full-page ad on Independence Day! It was great and very appropriate. Kevin Wiyninger, Midwest City</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense counsel Don West holds a photo of George Zimmerman taken the night Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in Seminole Circuit Court, in Sanford, Fla., on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, FLA. - An expert on gunshot wounds hired by the defense testified Tuesday that George Zimmerman's account of how he fatally shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is consistent with the forensic evidence, as defense attorneys started wrapping up their presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Vincent DiMaio said the trajectory of the bullet and gun powder on Martin's body support Zimmerman's version that Martin was on top of him when Zimmerman fired his gun into Martin's chest. The gun's muzzle was against Martin's clothing, and it was anywhere from 2 to 4 inches from Martin's skin, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman's account that Mr. Martin was over him, leaning forward at the time he was shot,&quot; said DiMaio, the former chief medical examiner in San Antonio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pathologist also said it was likely Martin was conscious for 10 to 15 seconds after the shooting as a reserve supply of oxygen ran out of his body, and during that time he could have moved his arms. Zimmerman's account that he had placed Martin's arms out to his sides after the shooting contradicts a photo taken after the shooting that shows Martin's arms under his body. Defense attorneys contend Martin moved his arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DiMaio testified that lacerations to the back of Zimmerman's head were consistent with his head striking a concrete sidewalk. Later, when looking at photos of Zimmerman's injuries taken the night of the shooting, DiMaio identified six impacts to Zimmerman's face and head. He said a nose injury could have come from being punched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DiMaio also explained that if clothes taken into evidence are wet and packaged in plastic bags, and not paper bags, it can ruin the samples since &quot;bacteria multiplies and you get mold and it stinks to high heaven.&quot; Defense attorneys believe DNA evidence found on Martin's hooded sweatshirt and undershirt was degraded since the clothing wasn't packaged properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under cross-examination, DiMaio conceded that the gunshot could also be consistent with Martin pulling away from Zimmerman, and that he didn't rely on statements from some Zimmerman neighbors who say Zimmerman was on top of Martin to reach his conclusion. The pathologist, who also has testified at the murder trials of Illinois police sergeant Drew Peterson and record producer Phil Spec-tor, said he had been paid $2,400 by the defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After DiMaio testified, the 911 calls that captured sounds of the fatal encounter were discussed again. Defense attorneys called Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte to the witness stand to describe the circumstances of how Martin's family came to hear the 911 tapes. Bonaparte said he played the 911 tapes while members of Martin's family sat together at City Hall. He played them as a courtesy before they were released publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys are trying to show that Martin's family members may have influenced each other in concluding the screams are those of the Miami teen. Police officers testified for the defense that it's better for someone who is trying to identify a voice to listen to it alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Mark O'Mara also told Judge Debra Nelson that the defense would likely finish putting on its case today. Zimmerman, so far, hasn't testified. But jurors saw repeated video recordings of Zimmerman telling his side of the story to police investigators. The defense started its case Friday, and if it keeps to the schedule anticipated by O'Mara, its presentation will take about half of the time of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying they want to stop the &quot;epidemic&quot; of violence that is killing young black males, a grass-roots organization founded in Jacksonville issued its &quot;national battle cry&quot; Tuesday to grow Operation Save Our Sons outside the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As George Zimmerman faces trial for the 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, organizers are reaching out nationally to nonprofit organizations, school districts and police departments to help them teach young black men how to respond better when confronted by police or anyone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Martin had been taught to call his father &quot;a few doors away&quot; that night instead of getting into a confrontation with Zimmerman, his death might have been avoided, the Rev. John Guns said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns, the group's founder and St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church pastor, said a goal is to empower 10- to 18-year-olds to make better decisions. That education starts with a Sept. 14 event called &quot;Fathers Calling Fathers&quot; and continues with a &quot;Million Son March&quot; next year in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will take work to find volunteers and nonprofit groups to set up programs locally and nationally to help teens change the way they interact with police and others, Guns said. But he said they are confident that their message can spread nationwide so &quot;we will see fewer funerals, less young men going to prison and fathers being raised out of boys.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to change an entire system because it is a psychosis that has invaded us, and at the end of the day there is this assumption that if you see a certain person dressed a certain way, they must be up to no good,&quot; Guns said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns is working with Community Connections to set up headquarters at its A.L. Lewis Center at 3655 Ribault Scenic Drive. As group members made their announcement there Tuesday, boys playing in its summer camp came out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many kids don't respect police or their parents, so Save Our Sons is needed in communities, said Jaylen Burroughs, 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a whole bunch of hoods and stuff on the street, like fights and gang-bangers,&quot; said Devars Hall, 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Save Our Sons kicked things off May 18 at Ribault High School for hundreds of children, parents and community organizers. Now its organizers filed paperwork to set up chapters in other cities where community leaders have contacted them to do so, Guns said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mentoring program called &quot;Difference Makers&quot; will be launched in Duval County's school system to work with at-risk young men. The group will work with community organizations and police to set up programs that help teens develop more respect for officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another focus, &quot;Fathers Calling Fathers,&quot; will work with fathers and male authority figures to help them talk with the young men in their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To volunteer for Save Our Sons, call (904) 595-6105 or go to www.facebook.com/SaveOurSonsInc.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said that text messages and photographs from Martin's phone, which appeared to suggest Martin had a passion for organised fighting, were inadmissible because there was no proof he wrote them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson's decisions came at the start of the 12th and probably final day of evidence in Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial in Sanford, at which he has pleaded not guilty on the grounds of self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead attorney, said he expected to rest his case today, setting up closing arguments and the likelihood of the all-female jury of six being sent out to consider its verdict before the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal arguments over the animation continued late into Tuesday night, with Judge Nelson storming out of the courtroom at 10pm as defence lawyer Don West complained to her about the long hours he was working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood was calmer when the case resumed this morning, with Nelson agreeing with the state's objection that the animation by forensic specialist Daniel Schumaker was speculative rather than fact-based, and would be prejudicial for the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumaker had explained how he created the animated graphic using motion-capture suits similar to those used in Hollywood blockbusters such as Avatar and Iron Man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson, however, did allow the defence to introduce it as &quot;demonstrable evidence&quot;, meaning they could use it during closing arguments for illustrative purposes but the jury would be prohibited from considering it as they discussed their verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only witness to take the stand during today's morning session was Dennis Root, a former police officer and now a private investigator described by the defence as a &quot;use of force&quot; expert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Root testified that he had spoken to witnesses and considered police reports in determining what he believed happened during the altercation between Zimmerman and Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence has shown the jury photographs of Zimmerman with a bloody and swollen nose and cuts on the back of his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on injuries I saw depicted in the photographs, they're consistent with a physical fist fight. It did not appear there was any weapon used,&quot; Root said, adding that the fight &quot;ended up on the concrete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Root's testimony was used to add weight to the defence's argument that Martin was the aggressor in their fatal confrontation and that Zimmerman drew his 9mm semi-automatic pistol and fired once to save his life as his head was being smashed onto the concrete pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Root said he also interviewed Zimmerman, and the owner of a gym at which he took martial arts classes, to establish the defendant's background training and experience. Age, weight and physical capabilities, he said, were all relevant in establishing what might have happened during a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I was dealing with Chuck Norris I would expect a completely difference response to any kind of physical altercation than I would if I was dealing with Pee Wee Herman,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by O'Mara about Zimmerman's physical prowess or abilities, Root said: &quot;Without sounding offensive, he really didn't have any. Mr Zimmerman was a very nice person but not the fighter. He didn't have the physical prowess to go into boxing with another person. He wasn't at a skill level that permitted him to physically interact with another boxer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the more theatrical moments of the trial came on Wednesday when O'Mara and prosecutor John Guy took turns on the floor grappling with a life-size mannequin as they attempted to demonstrate their respective theories about what positions Zimmerman and Martin may have been in during their alleged fight. Defence witnesses have testified that Martin was on top and &quot;pummeling&quot; Zimmerman at the time of the fatal shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, police, church and community leaders in Miami, where the black teenager Martin lived, have begun preparing for any possible violent reaction to the verdict. At a public meeting on Tuesday night, Dr Walter Richardson, chairman of the Miami-Dade community relations board, urged calm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody's going to be disappointed with the outcome of this trial. It's all right to be vocal, it's wrong to be violent. We already lost one soul,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 15 people were killed in Miami in rioting that followed the acquittal of four police officers for beating to death a black motorist in 1980, but experts believe that violent protests are unlikely to be repeated if Zimmerman is freed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Miami-Dade County is a far more mature place than in the 1970s and 1980s when several court decisions resulted in violent reactions and fires and deaths and burning,&quot; Edward Shohat, chairman of the board's criminal justice committee, told the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Israel, the sheriff of Florida's Broward County, which also has a large, racially diverse population, launched a YouTube video with the help of local teenagers urging citizens to &quot;raise their voices, not their hands&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no reason to believe there will be any civil unrest of any kind. We just want to be prepared,&quot; Israel said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Congressional Black Caucus urged President Obama to take action on gun control legislation Tuesday at their first meeting with the president in more than two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama &quot;reaffirmed his commitment&quot; to the issue during the White House meeting, one administration official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president told the lawmakers that he will focus on gun violence and acknowledged the problem wasn't just about tragic events like the one in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children and six educators were killed by a lone gunman in December. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave examples of other places where gun violence was a problem, according to one attendee of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama started the year with a serious effort to win congressional approval of gun legislation. But his effort appeared to fail in the Senate, where legislation to impose tougher background checks on gun purchases failed to win 60 votes and overcome a filibuster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many black lawmakers have noted that a disproportionate number of African-Americans are victims of gun violence. Trayvon Martin, a black teenager killed in Florida last year in an altercation with a neighborhood watch volunteer, did not come up, a source familiar with the meeting said. The trial of the man accused of killing Martin has received enormous attention in the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting, said Obama is &quot;totally committed&quot; to passing tougher gun laws in his second term. The trick, she said, is getting Congress to agree and &quot;not allowing the National Rifle Association to control the agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to fight harder and the members of the public have to continue to speak out,&quot; Lee said. &quot;It's up to us; I think they [White House officials] are doing everything that they can do. It's the House that has not allowed these bills to come to the floor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee said Democrats are still seeking a comprehensive solution that includes efforts to ban military-style rifles, limit the number of bullets in magazines and take on inner-city hand-gun violence. She noted that public opinion polls show overwhelming support for those provisions and lamented that the same enthusiasm hasn't materialized on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the optics that's holding us up,&quot; she said, &quot;but hopefully we're going to break through that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), another attendee of Tuesday's meeting, said Obama has not &quot;ceded any ground&quot; on the issue, adding that he &quot;is particularly concerned about the urban gun violence that happens in places like Chicago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But he's perplexed as to how Congress could not have moved after the heinous tragedy in Sandy Hook,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting between Obama and the CBC came just days an eruption of gun violence in Chicago, with at least 74 people shot &macr; 12 fatally &macr; over the long July 4 weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers discussed a range of other issues with Obama, including education, immigration and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black lawmakers at times have been frustrated with Obama's handling of the economy and with his Cabinet appointments, and the aide acknowledged there were some tough questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a certain level of immediacy these folks want,&quot; the administration official said. &quot;They want to see stuff get done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the meeting, caucus Chairwoman Martha Fudge (D-Ohio) noted there are &quot;obvious differences in the way we want things to go forward and the way the White House wants to move things forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black lawmakers have sometimes criticized the administration, for example, for not doing more to boost black employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An administration official acknowledged that there was a difference of opinion in the execution of job training programs and other issues pertaining to young people and employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official added that Obama has certain ideas on the programs while members have other ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're on the same page but the way they want to execute some of these ideas is different,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some lawmakers in the meeting raised the issue of backlogs in benefits for veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama agreed, calling it &quot;inexcusably long,&quot; according to one attendee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama told the lawmakers that he assigned Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors to the task to make sure that turns around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, while there have been differences between the CBC and Obama over the economy and his Cabinet, lawmakers exiting Tuesday's meeting presented a unified front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're on the same page,&quot; Fudge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), one of the group's members and the third-ranking House Democrat, said lawmakers asked Obama to make sure initiatives like broadband deployment and infrastructure improvements would be &quot;targeted&quot; to &quot;communities of need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president was supportive to that approach,&quot; Clyburn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fudge called the meeting &quot;very productive,&quot; and said she was not concerned that Obama and the CBC had not met for 790 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have a concern,&quot; Fudge said. &quot;I've been chair about 6 months, and the request that we made of the president has been answered. I think it was an excellent conversation, and I think the lines of communication have not only been open but actually we can have broader and deeper conversations after the meeting today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fudge made headlines in March with a letter to Obama that criticized his Cabinet appointments, saying they had &quot;hardly been reflective of this country's diversity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the president has appointed former Charlotte, N.C., Mayor Anthony Foxx as Transportation secretary and former CBC chairman Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.) as the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked Tuesday if she had discussed her diversity concerns with the president, Fudge said she simply &quot;thanked the president for Mel Watt and Anthony Foxx.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A White House aide confirmed that no one in the meeting took issue with the lack of diversity in the Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group also spent a significant amount of time discussing strategies to address the Supreme Court's recent ruling on the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fudge called the conversation a &quot;beginning,&quot; saying that the lawmakers discussed how to strengthen Section II of the act and how to develop alternative formulas that might allow the federal government the authority to have pre-clearance authority on changes to state voting laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court in June threw out a key portion of the Voting Rights Act, arguing formulas used to determine that some states required &quot;preclearance&quot; was outdated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; TAG</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1401  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This op-ed was written exclusively for THR by Marcia Clark, the former Los Angeles deputy district attorney who is best known for her work as the lead prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson murder trial. She has since become an on-air legal analyst and a best-selling author. &quot;Killer Ambition,&quot; the latest installment of her Rachel Knight legal-thriller series, was published last month and focuses on the investigation and prosecution of a Hollywood power player for murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it was the &quot;Trial of the Century&quot; may be subject to debate, but no one disputes the fact that the O.J. Simpson murder trial was an unparalleled media circus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seemed to happen overnight. On the eve of the preliminary hearing, the parking lot behind the courthouse sprouted a fleet of satellite trucks. Not long after that, a slew of vendors appeared, selling T shirts, mugs, buttons, hats - you name it - emblazoned with the images of Nicole, Ron, Simpson and the lawyers. And then there were the street performers - mimes, acrobats, dancers. I'd call it bizarre, but frankly, that scene left 'bizarre' a distant dot on the horizon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even more ubiquitous was the press. They were everywhere. Print reporters had their own wing on a floor inside the courthouse and the television reporters erected a base of operations, dubbed &quot;Camp O.J.,&quot; a multi-tiered scaffolding of dubious safety, across the street. Reporters and camera crews surrounded the building, packed the courthouse hallways and filled the courtroom five days a week. At every court recess, the press was first out the door so they could pounce on anyone even remotely associated with the case as they walked through the door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHOTOS: 10 TV Trials That Shook The World</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the 24/7 coverage was driven by public appetite or foisted upon the public by producers who saw the soap opera potential, the demand for news had become a hungry maw that required constant feeding. Competition for the latest and hottest piece of news led to reliance on sources that were minimally vetted, if indeed they were vetted at all. Every story was breathlessly recounted with very little concern for its veracity. Lawyers piled on to represent witnesses who had no real need for legal help, just to get their names in print. And wannabe witnesses and &quot;friends&quot; of Nicole Brown sold books and stories to tabloids for princely sums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow, in the midst of all this, the lawyers' personal lives wound up in the spotlight. Like the rest of the frenzy, this too was unprecedented. Before the Simpson trial, lawyers were lucky if the press spelled their names right. But for some reason - maybe because the trial dragged on so long - the lawyers themselves became a media focus. Our families and friends were courted (stalked, actually) for stories. My hair and skirt length became prime time fodder for comedians and commentators, reporters showed up on my doorstep. People sold videos of me going to the dry cleaners (riveting stuff), the grocery store (wow) and taking my children to Travel Town. I kept thinking - hoping - it would stop, that the press would get bored and move on to better, more important matters, but it never did. In fact, for months after the trial, our personal lives continued to be covered in newspapers, tabloids and magazines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that was nineteen years ago. Flash forward to the George Zimmerman trial, the latest in a long string of high-profile cases that have now become a staple on cable news channels. Have things changed? I think so, and largely for the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIDEO: Howard Kurtz During Fox Debut: CNN, MSNBC 'Over-Cover' Zimmerman Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those things is the media landscape. Since the 90's, there has been a proliferation of cable channels that have made trial coverage a regular staple. Broadcast network channels are largely out of the business of trial coverage other than the occasional headline updates. That means that although a wide section of the nation may know that a trial is happening and have some general idea as to what it's about, a relatively small number of people actively follow the case gavel to gavel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a good thing because a smaller audience means lawyers have less &quot;reach,&quot; i.e., less opportunity to spin the case for the jury pool. The upshot is a public far less tainted with pretrial posturing. Note, I didn't say completely untainted. Even though national news programs don't focus on the case, the local news shows in the city where the trial takes place will give it more - if not exhaustive - airtime. And in fact, the lawyers in the Zimmerman case had to incorporate an additional step in the jury selection process to weed out those who'd been exposed to and unduly influenced by pretrial publicity. But even so, it didn't take long for them to find a pool of jurors who hadn't formed fixed opinions about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A smaller audience also means less temptation for witnesses to sell their stories. That's a good thing for a couple of reasons. When witnesses sell their stories they damage their credibility. And when there's money to be made on testimony, there are bound to be &quot;faux&quot; witnesses who make up their stories for fame and profit. Again, it doesn't eliminate the problem entirely: Zimmerman's buddy, Mark Osterman, wrote a book defending Zimmerman four months after the shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. But he was the only one, and his book was admittedly an effort to support Zimmerman's defense -- not a tabloid expose of his sexual exploits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIDEO: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's Mother Takes Stand in Televised Testimony</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's another change for the better: Judges don't pander to the press or to Hollywood glitterati. No invitations to celebrities to join them in chambers, no television documentaries of their personal profiles. They just do their job. And especially in the trials of Casey Anthony and George Zimmerman, they do them well. Strong, decisive and no-nonsense, both of those judges make everyone toe the line, enforce the rules of evidence with an even hand and make sure no time is wasted while a sequestered jury languishes backstage. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with the verdicts, it cannot be disputed that both sides got a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another change for better: no more celebrity lawyers. We don't hear stories about the lawyers' personal lives or see footage shot on their front doorsteps. Commentary now focuses on what they're doing in court and why they're doing it. In other words, their work -- and that's fair game. Yes, some will wind up becoming commentators on cable news shows after their trials are over (myself included), but that has its uses: if there's going to be trial coverage, networks will need lawyers to explain the law, explain what's happening and offer personal insights that can be helpful. In any case, the point is, by and large, punditry sticks to the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not to say that some of the shows don't devolve into mindless screaming or focus unduly on salacious -- yet legally meaningless -- details. They do. But overall, the level of discourse has improved tremendously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIDEO: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's Mother Appears on 'The View' as Trial Looms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the reporters in the courtroom report the evidence -- they don't try to inflate ridiculous claims from either side with false credibility in order to make the race seem closer. Certainly, hosts ask commentators for their opinions and the lawyers involved in the case stump for their respective sides, but there's a line drawn between what happened in court and what the pundits think of it. That's a big improvement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the reporting, by and large, has become more reliable. This I've seen first hand. It's not uncommon for producers to tell me, &quot;We've heard that the defense is going to put Ms. X on the stand, but we can't go with it because it's not confirmed.&quot; That's a far cry from the breathless race for the scoop during the O.J. trial that led to misreporting and false stories -- largely retracted too long after the fact for anyone to notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a very important change for the better, because a main point of our established right to a public trial is that the public will hold the courts accountable. That right is rendered meaningless if irresponsible coverage misrepresents what's going on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do all these changes mean that the media hasn't impacted the Zimmerman jury? That I can't say. I can only say that there has been enough progress to at least hope that it hasn't. Much.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mob Rule: It's come out in the George Zimmerman murder trial that the state of Florida withheld key exculpatory evidence in its arrest affidavit and charged Zimmerman under false pretenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty-four days after local police released neighborhood-watch captain Zimmerman from custody, ruling he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in self defense, a special state task force set up under pressure from the Obama administration decided it was murder -- with no grand jury input. Among evidence to support the charge, the affidavit noted Martin's mother listened to a recorded 911 call and &quot;identified the voice crying for help as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Left out of that April 11, 2012, document was the fact that Martin's father also heard the same tape and concluded unambiguously -- according to the testimony of two detectives -- that it was not his son screaming. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other witnesses have identified the voice as Zimmerman's, which makes sense since eyewitnesses saw the 6-foot-3 Martin straddling him and pounding his face and head on the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More, the affidavit omitted medical evidence of injuries to Zimmerman's face and back of his head, as well as forensic evidence of grass stains on his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force, led by state attorney Angela Corey, claimed Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; Martin, who was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it conveniently failed to mention a toxicology report finding traces of marijuana in Martin's blood and urine -- which would have corroborated Zimmerman's remark to a 911 dispatcher that Martin acted like he was &quot;on drugs.&quot; Police had trained Zimmerman to spot non-residents acting suspiciously in his townhouse complex, which had been the target of a rash of break-ins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lead detective in the case, Chris Serino, said he felt pressure to charge Zimmerman with murder, even though he said there was no evidence to support it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From where did such pressure come? All the way from Washington. Consider this timeline:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feb. 26, 2012: Zimmerman shoots Martin, claiming self-defense; later released after police questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 12: Sanford, Fla., police chief insists there's not enough evidence to charge Zimmerman, but turns investigation over to the state attorney's office for review after protests from civil-rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 20: Attorney General Holder launches investigation of police handling of case. U.S. prosecutors meet with Martin's parents and the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 22: Al Sharpton holds rally, yelling: &quot;We came for permanent justice. Arrest Zimmerman now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 22: Florida Gov. Rick Scott puts Corey on case; Corey decides not to let grand jury review evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 23: In White House press conference, President Obama expresses sympathy for Martin parents: &quot;If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.&quot; He adds, &quot;It's absolutely imperative we investigate every aspect of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 24: New Black Panthers offer $10,000 bounty for &quot;capture&quot; of Zimmerman, threaten his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 2: Holder meets Congressional Black Caucus, Sharpton and other black ministers in White House, pledges &quot;swift action&quot; in the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 11: Holder speaks alongside Sharpton at his National Action Network convention in New York, where he threatens to charge authorities in Florida with &quot;civil rights crime.&quot; Zimmerman is taken into custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's now clear that the decision to arrest Zimmerman and put him on trial -- which again, came 44 days after Zimmerman was questioned and released -- was, unconscionably, a political response to pressure from a race-obsessed president and his attorney general and the racial arsonists like Sharpton with whom they run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was rank corruption of our justice system to engineer a politically correct verdict, and it's a frighteningly bad omen for the rule of law in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this president truly respects the law, he will reinject himself into this case -- only, this time by asking everyone to respect the actual facts and evidence in the case and let them prevail over emotional assumptions, in order to defuse any violence from occurring as the case against Zimmerman further disintegrates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what a responsible president would do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we're not holding our breath he'll do the right thing. Still, one thing is for sure: Any blood from planned race rioting will be on his hands.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It''s hard not to feel a tingle of anticipation every time Alec Baldwin starts to look mildly cross. In a world of raving, feud-waging celebrities, he is a rock star. He doesn''t simply lose his temper - he blows like Mount Vesuvius crammed with nitroglycerin and left near an open gas pipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was made explosively clear last week as he embarked on a Twitter tirade on a reporter who had written something unflattering about his young wife, Hilaria. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You lying little bitch,&quot; he tweeted to journalist George Stark. &quot;I am gonna f%#@ you up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  As details of his Twitter attack pinged around the world and Baldwin was accused of homophobia, the actor issued a forthright apology (he had tweeted that he would &quot;put his foot up&quot; Stark's &quot;ass&quot; were it not for the fact that the journalist would &quot;dig it too much&quot;). He subsequently shuttered his Twitter account, vowing never to darken the door of social media again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It''s too early to know if he will keep true to his vow. However, if he does stay off Twitter, the world will have to bid adieu to a special voice. To mark his retirement, here are Baldwin''s finest headlinegobbling instances of blind rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICE ICE BABY Chatting to Jerry Seinfield on his National Public Radio interview show, Baldwin posed an odd question: had Seinfeld ever done anything in his life of which he remained stubbornly proud, no matter how much criticism he received subsequently? The comedian shrugged, so Baldwin pitched in with an anecdote of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a journey through rush hour Manhattan he had drawn up alongside a taxi containing several teenagers. Recognising him they started to mouth expletives, then sped off. Catching up with the kids several blocks on, Baldwin chucked the iced coffee he was drinking into the back of the cab, drenching his antagonisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went woosh and I threw it right into the window of the car. It literally hit him in the chest and the liquid went woosh, all over. They had overplayed their hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SNAP UNHAPPY Last summer, Baldwin had an unpleasant standoff with a photographer from the New York Daily News, who approached him outside his apartment. Words were exchanged - but clearly Baldwin felt he had more to say, as he cut loose on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 'photographer'' almost hit me in the face with his camera this morning,&quot; he wrote, adding the hashtag 'all paparazzi should be waterboarded'. '. He then invoked the controversial shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. &quot;I suppose if the offending paparazzi was wearing a hoodie, and I shot him, it would all blow over.&quot; Stay classy Alec.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUEEN OF ALL HE SURVEYS In 2010 the National Inquirer ran a story about Twitter tirade: Alec Baldwin and his wife Hilaria an alleged shouting match between Baldwin and 30 Rock co-star Tina Fey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreshadowing the widely perceived homophobic overtones of his attack on George Stark, Baldwin dubbed National Inquirer columnist Mike Walker a &quot;whore&quot; and &quot;queen&quot;. Walker hit back, accusing Baldwin of being a &quot;raging closet homophobe&quot;. Baldwin had the last word, even if it didn''t make much sense. &quot;He [Walker] is a goat-footed, wheezy, old queen,&quot; he told the New York Post. &quot;And all my male lovers agree with me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIVIN' LA VIDA MOCHA Two years ago Baldwin had a loud disagreement with a Starbucks barista. Naturally he decided to express his unhappiness via Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Starbucks on 93 and B''way. Uptight Queen barista named JAY has an attitude problem.&quot; This time, there was pushback, with individuals who had witnessed the exchange rushing to &quot;Jay's&quot; defence. &quot;I was here when it happened - it was really just [Alec] being an [expletive],&quot; said a bystander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IRELAND''S CALL A &quot;zip up your mickey moment&quot; of the first order, in 2007 Alec Baldwin left a cutting voicemail for his then 11-year-old daughter Ireland after she missed his scheduled call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dubbed her a &quot;rude, vile little pig,&quot; adding &quot;you have humiliated me for the last time&quot;. Somehow the message made its way into the public realm and was an early scoop for gossip site TMZ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- With the defense a day away from wrapping up its case, a widely known expert in forensic pathology, Dr. Vincent Di Maio, testified on Tuesday that Trayvon Martin's injuries suggest he was on top of and leaning over George Zimmerman when Mr. Zimmerman fired his gun last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness for the defense, Dr. Di Maio said the gun barrel rested against Mr. Martin's sweatshirt, which hung two to four inches away from Mr. Martin's chest. The bullet, he said, entered his heart from the front, in a left to right direction, and plunged into one of his lungs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman's account,'' said Dr. Di Maio, the retired longtime chief medical examiner for Bexar County, Tex., whose county seat is San Antonio. ''That Mr. Martin was over him, leaning forward, at the time that he was shot.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Di Maio also said it was possible for Mr. Martin to have moved or talked for at least 10 to 15 seconds after he was shot because of the reservoir of oxygen in the brain. Defense lawyers hoped that this might explain why Mr. Martin was not found on his back with his arms outstretched, as Mr. Zimmerman has described, but face down with his arms under him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Di Maio will be one of the defense's final witnesses. By day's end, Mark O'Mara, one of Mr. Zimmerman's lawyers, said he would be finished by Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this juncture, Mr. Zimmerman appears unlikely to testify, a sign of confidence on the part of the defense. Placing a defendant on the stand is always fraught with risk. In this case, Mr. Zimmerman provided so many statements to the police that it may not be necessary, legal experts have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Dr. Di Maio, who wrote a book on gunshot wounds, walked the jury through the science of the bullet's trajectory and chronicled the injuries of both Mr. Martin and Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under cross-examination, Dr. Di Maio said it was possible that Mr. Martin could have been trying to get off Mr. Zimmerman, even if he was leaning. The doctor also told the jury that he had been paid $2,400 so far by the defense to testify at the trial, adding, ''This is not exactly a complicated case forensically.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman, 29, is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Mr. Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old, on Feb. 26, 2012. He told the police that he shot Mr. Martin in self-defense after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him in the nose, straddled him on the ground and repeatedly slammed his head into the pavement. The prosecution maintains that Mr. Zimmerman, the volunteer neighborhood watch coordinator, pursued Mr. Martin and instigated the confrontation that ended in Mr. Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the defense, the purpose of Dr. Di Maio's testimony was to document the injuries and the path of the bullet to show that they were consistent with Mr. Zimmerman's account of the struggle. The prosecution contends that Mr. Zimmerman's injuries were relatively minor, defying his claim that his head had struck concrete again and again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the chief prosecutor, Bernie de la Rionda, suggested to Dr. Di Maio that perhaps a tree branch or rolling on pavement could have caused the cuts and lumps to his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, he replied, but ''you'd have to have a tree branch there and I didn't see any,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Di Maio testified that Mr. Zimmerman suffered at least six identifiable injuries to his face and head. Among them, he said, were two separate swollen spots on his head, along with rows of red spots, that were consistent with the assault that Mr. Zimmerman had described. A nose injury -- most likely a broken nose that was pushed back in place, he said -- and markings on his forehead were consistent with punches, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that there were only two small cuts to the back of the head does not mean his head did not strike the concrete, Dr. Di Maio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head injuries do not necessarily cause visible bleeding, he said. The bleeding often occurs inside the skull, which is why CT scans are used on people with head injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everyone has fallen and hit their head, and you don't get lacerations,'' Dr. Di Maio said. ''You can get severe head trauma actually without any marks on the head. Or you can get marks, lacerations and contusions and have head trauma.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intracranial bleeding is often the most worrisome wound resulting from head injury. As the brain crashes into the skull, it can cause concussions, impairment and death, he said. Dr. Di Maio said Mr. Zimmerman's wounds could have caused him to feel stunned. The injuries did not appear to be life-threatening, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Concrete doesn't yield when your head hits concrete,'' he said. ''Your head yields to the concrete.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether the lack of bruising on Mr. Martin's knuckles was significant, Dr. Di Maio said that knuckles can bruise or not bruise depending on what they hit. Dr. Di Maio also said that bruising can sometimes be found inside the hand, but the doctor who performed the autopsy did not check. The prosecution contends that the near lack of wounds on Mr. Martin's hands shows he did not punch Mr. Zimmerman repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Di Maio also was critical of crime scene and evidence technicians. Mr. Martin's wet clothing was sealed in plastic, which led to the accumulation of mold and bacteria. This can degrade DNA, he said. Earlier in the trial a witness testified that when he opened the evidence bag it smelled ''pungent,'' a sign it had been compromised. The cuffs and sleeves of Mr. Martin's sweatshirt did not contain Mr. Zimmerman's DNA, despite the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later on Tuesday, the defense returned to a discussion of the 911 call on the night of the shooting that contained shouts for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness, Norton N. Bonaparte Jr., Sanford's city manager, testified that Mr. Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, and a few relatives had been invited to the mayor's office to hear the call. They asked that law enforcement not be present. After hearing the call, Mr. Martin's parents concluded it was their son screaming for help. Two police officers testified that Tracy Martin said two days after the shooting that it was not his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that they heard the call together, instead of individually, raised concerns among law enforcement officials who said the parents could have influenced one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bonaparte said he and the mayor were trying to be sensitive to the parents in their anguish.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Florida (AP) The father of a black teenager shot dead in by a U.S. neighborhood watch volunteer said Monday he never denied it was his son&quot;s voice screaming for help on a phone call to police, contradicting officers&quot; testimony at George Zimmerman&quot;s murder trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Monday, the judge ruled that defense attorneys may present evidence that the teen, Trayvon Martin, had marijuana in his system when he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convincing the jury of whose voice is on the phone tapes is important to both sides because it would help jurors decide on the aggressor in the nighttime confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case drew national protests when Zimmerman went without arrest for weeks, and questions have focused on race and self-defense gun laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and says he shot Martin in self-defense during a scuffle in the gated community where he lived. Martin was there visiting family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors contend that Zimmerman was profiling Martin and perceived the teen as someone suspicious in the neighborhood, which had been the site of a series of break-ins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lead detective in the case, officer Chris Serino, spoke about a meeting with Martin&quot;s father in the days after the black teen was fatally shot by Zimmerman last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serino testified that when Tracy Martin listened to the police recording and was asked if it was his son, Martin said &quot;no,&quot; Serino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He looked away and under his breath he said &quot;no&quot;,&quot; Serino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under cross examination, prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda suggested that Martin may have been in denial about his son&quot;s death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be perceived as denial,&quot; Serino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teen&quot;s father denied the officer&quot;s account. &quot;I never said that wasn&quot;t my son&quot;s voice,&quot; said Tracy Martin, who added that he concluded it was his son after listening to the call as many as 20 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency call captured the confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin shortly before Zimmerman fatally shot the teen. Zimmerman&quot;s mother and uncle have testified it was Zimmerman screaming. Martin&quot;s mother and brother said the voice belonged to Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman himself once said during a police interview that the screams didn&quot;t sound like him, though he and his family later said the screams were his.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the &quot;Whose voice was on the 911 tape?&quot; and other items the defense is throwing at the jury -- including the latest &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; gambit -- are just smoke and mirrors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply: George Zimmerman was told by the 911 dispatcher not to approach Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but he did. If George Zimmerman picked a fight and then started to lose that fight, it wasn't Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's fault. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin knew that he was being followed and he was creeped out. But he wasn't doing anything but returning home. He had a right to be in the complex. He was visiting with his father after making a run to the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are enough inconsistencies in George Zimmerman's stories that there should be plenty of doubts about him planted in the minds of the jurors -- all are in the interviews he gave the media and follow-up sessions Zimmerman had with the police. Anyone care anymore that when this process began Zimmerman lied to the court about how much money he had available for bail? Begin there, and sift forward.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palm Beach Gardens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was Zimmerman right to pursue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense is trying to prove that the scream on the police call is that of George Zimmerman. That's a great strategy -- muddy the water and claim that George was the one who was in need of assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of how the jury considers this part of the trial, the real question is: Did George have the right to go after Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, kill him and then declare it was self-defense?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From my perspective, this is similar to the child who kills both his parents and then asks the court to show mercy since the child is now an orphan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voice-print tech is not junk science</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key to the George Zimmerman trial is the screams recorded on a 911 call by a neighbor. The question is whose screams they are? The prosecution wanted to admit two experts on voice-print technology to prove that the screams came from Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The defense objected claiming that this is junk science and the judge agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if you Google voice-print technology you can see that this is not junk science. It is established technology that has been in use for 50 years. This evidence has been successfully used in thousands of court cases and accepted by the higher courts on appeals. Indeed, it is part of a billion-dollar industry including voice recognition technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are voice prints? Everybody's voice is like a fingerprint because it is made up of the shape of your throat, nose, voice box and breathing. The defense in this trial claims that it could not identify the screams on the 911 tape. The judge should have ordered Zimmerman to be examined by experts who would identify his voice print and then match it up with the screams on the tape. Yet this judge refused to allow Mr. Zimmerman to be examined. Why?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman trial a waste of money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case has turned into one big joke. The judge in this case is far from impartial. She is looking for a conviction, as shown by her refusal of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense quoted many similar cases which resulted in acquittal. I believe she wants a conviction so the case will be overturned in a higher court. This will eliminate the chance of demonstrations outside the courthouse, and her hands will be cleaned of any bias. The state has failed to show second-degree murder, and now we are just wasting taxpayer money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">party before people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pardon my liberal cynicism, but it seems that there is a group of GOP operatives whose main function is to constantly dig up dirt that they can lay at the feet of President Barack Obama and his administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are much like the gang that assembled on inauguration night in 2009 to prepare an agenda to prevent the new Democratic president from getting any positive work done in his first four years and prevent him from achieving a second term at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the gubernatorial and state races in 2010, many states followed a typical political cycle and went Republican. That allowed for the gerrymandering of congressional districts and the opportunity to enact the voter obstruction and union-busting measures to ensure that the GOP majority in the House of Representatives could block any constructive legislation that President Obama and his administration could hope to get passed for the benefit of the American people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traffic was light as I headed home from work on Interstate 95, and I was zipping along when I heard a pop. When I pulled off, my left rear tire was as flat as a pancake. I called my husband for help, but it would take him at least a half-hour to reach me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I put on my flashers, got out of the car, put my trunk up and waited. Up ahead I saw a truck pull off to the side and back up. A man got out and kindly asked if I needed help. I told him that help was, indeed, on the way. He said, &quot;If you were my wife, I would want someone to help her, too. It will take me 5 minutes and when your husband comes, you can both be on your way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, in a jiff the tire was changed and my husband pulled up as the last lug nut was being tightened.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find myself wishing that the Koch brothers of Palm Beach, who obviously have plenty of smarts and even more money, instead of attempting to buy many newspapers in order to advance their plan of destroying President Barack Obama and to advance corporate greed, would instead use these smarts and money to become the fathers of a Marshall Plan for the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among serious threats to our planet is our energy policy that allows putting carbon dioxide into the climate system for millennia. Wouldn't you, the Koch brothers, rather be known far into the future as saviors of the planet? Your legacy right now is more likely to be ignominy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way we might reach peace in the Middle East is if the religious teachers, who are the origin of the problems, stop teaching hate. If you review the history of the worst problem on this Earth, you will find religious leaders teaching and preaching hate for minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Israel, peace is taught and preached by all but their neighbors, who continue to instill hate for Jews -- including not showing Israel on maps; so, is it not logical that these kids will grow up feeling close to jihadists?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I started reading Jac Wilder VerSteeg's column, &quot;Did restrictions target blacks or Democrats?&quot; because it contained a photo of Paula Deen and thought he decided to do a commentary on the facts surrounding Paula Deen's recent travels through her choice of words in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it had nothing to do with Paula Deen but everything to do with his efforts in trying to make this a political football yet again. He went through his Southern upbringing, which was irrelevant, and eventually landed on a Republican/Democrat kickball game of voting in Florida. None of which had anything to do with Paula Deen. Let's not use headlines to create a story when there isn't one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the new video, Amanda Berry says, &quot;I want everyone to know how happy I am to be home with my family and my friends. ... I'm getting stronger each day, and having my privacy has helped immensely. I ask that everyone continue to respect our privacy and give us time to have a normal life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asiana pilots interviewed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- An Asiana Airlines pilot told investigators he noticed Flight 214 was coming in too low to San Francisco International Airport on Saturday, and tried to correct the plane's landing path just before it crashed, officials said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Transportation Safety Board Deborah A.P. Hersman said during a news conference that at impact, two flight attendants were ejected from the plane and were not present to help with evacuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the flight marking the first time the pilot at the controls had tried to land a 777 in San Francisco, it was the first time the instructor had flown in that role and the first time the two had flown together, she said, citing completed interviews with three of the four pilots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense nearly done</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANFORD, Fla. -- With the defense a day away from wrapping up its case, a widely known expert in forensic pathology, Vincent Di Maio, testified Tuesday that Trayvon Martin was on top of and leaning over George Zimmerman when Zimmerman fired his gun last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is consistent with Mr. Zimmerman's account,&quot; said Dr. Di Maio, the retired chief medical examiner for Bexar County, Texas. At this juncture, Mr. Zimmerman appears unlikely to testify, a sign of confidence on the part of the defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New charges for Bonannos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- A state racketeering indictment unsealed late Monday that charges eight men as members and associates of the Bonanno crime family suggests that the mob, despite its waning power and the government's considerable efforts to dismantle it, can still penetrate and control unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-count indictment, which charges mob staples like crimes of extortion, gambling and loan-sharking, accuses a Bonanno soldier and an associate of assisting in the 2010 election of another crime family associate as the president of a 1,900-member Teamsters union local on Long Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buffet reveals donations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., gave a record $2 billion to the foundation created by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates after telling billionaires to commit half their wealth to charity because $500 million is plenty to live on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Omaha, Neb.-based firm announced the gift in a statement. Mr. Buffett said last month that he gives away shares because they have more &quot;utility in the hands of others&quot; and reiterated his plea for other billionaires to follow suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this summer of Paula Deen, Trayvon Martin and controversial Supreme Court decisions on voting rights and affirmative action, people seem to be struggling -- again -- with the issue of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And J.G. Boccella wants us to talk about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday night, Mr. Boccella, a 46-year-old recording artist, painter and civil rights advocate, is organizing &quot;Conversation We&quot; -- an unusual concert at Winchester Thurston School in Shadyside that will not only include music by a diverse group of artists, but also an open-ended discussion about the thorniest, most delicate and most ineradicable subject in America today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation will actually begin tonight at the Brillobox in Lawrenceville, as part of that venue's &quot;Ignite Pittsburgh&quot; series of forums, where Mr. Boccella will talk about his upcoming book and lecture series, &quot;The Conversation We COULD Be Having,&quot; which lays out his core concepts for talking about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Thursday he breaks out the music, &quot;which fosters community, and out of community can come relationships ... and we need relationships to make social change,&quot; said Mr. Boccella. &quot;Relationships take the other person from being a &quot;concept&quot; to being a friend, someone whose destiny you care about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides a performance by Mr. Boccella's band Modo Mio, others on the concert's list include Nigerian-American singer Joy Ike, and singer-songwriters Heather Kropf and Preach Freedom, artists who blend all sorts of musical traditions, from jazz to spirituals to folk, in their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't the first &quot;Conversation We&quot; event hosted by Mr. Boccella, who lives in the East End with his wife, Demeatria, and their daughter. He has spent much of his career as an educator, lecturing and organizing workshops at schools, universities, educational organizations, foundations and churches from Oklahoma to South Carolina to Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a human being -- and a white man,&quot; he says. &quot;I am not either a human being OR a white man; I am both. If I act like my 'white-man-ness' doesn't affect my life and afford me certain advantages, then that's the denial; if I act like I should somehow feel bad just for being white, that's the guilt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, he began to notice what he calls &quot;a hidden demographic&quot; of people who really want to connect across lines of race, socially, professionally and intellectually, but who didn't have a way in, in part because they were &quot;jammed up with guilt and denial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just white guilt, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too often, he adds, people of color &quot;feel they can't share their whole reality, and that they are often cast in the role of representing their entire racial group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, then, Mr. Boccella opens up the conversation with a set of questions: What kind of language could we use when talking about race? How do we engage a person's whole humanity -- not just their skin color -- in the context of this conversation? What does it mean to be an ally?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been watching J.G. develop this idea over a long period of time,&quot; said Ms. Kropf. &quot;He's a really good facilitator who knows how to create a safe space for people to express what they're talking and thinking and feeling without being ugly. It works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Ike, whose family moved from Nigeria to the U.S. more than 30 years ago, says this is the first time she's participated, but people &quot;have been making assumptions about me based on cultural stereotypes for a long time. They come up to me and say you don't sound black,&quot; when, in fact she is -- just not an African-American whose ancestors were slaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with a B.A. from Brown University and a master's degree in education from Harvard University, Mr. Boccella does what so many artists must do to survive: He multitasks. Not only is he developing a book but also playing with his band, just releasing a new single, &quot;Unstoppable,&quot; that has the same playful jazzy beat -- along with clever social commentary -- of his other music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm an Old-School-Hip-Hop-Rock &amp; Roll-Gospel-Music-loving-Bob-Marley-Fanatic,&quot; he says on his website, jgboccella.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's also painting: His latest series of works, &quot;Fierce Women,&quot; with be exhibited at Tula Organic in Squirrel Hill in September, and he has eight commissioned portraits in the works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Boccella was born into a family of artists concerned with social justice, from the plight of Native Americans to the treatment of animals: While his 80-year-old father, John, a dentist, still has a full-time practice in East Liberty, his mother, Gerry Rosella Boccella, is a poet, part of Carlow University's &quot;Madwomen in the Attic&quot; creative writing workshop, as well as a pianist and a designer. His sister Mia Boccella Hartle is an award-winning documentary filmmaker, and his younger sister, Amata, is a poet who runs an animal sanctuary in New Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife, former director of grants programs at the Multi-Cultural Arts Initiative, is managing director of the Pittsburgh Jazz Orchestra and the Bill Nunn Theater Outreach Project. Each year, she organizes Fashion Africana, a global celebration of design, dance and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Boccella is quite straightforward about his own ambitions -- He'd love to be a musician full time. On the other hand, he hopes that one day, he won't need to organize a concert as a &quot;safe space&quot; to talk about racial differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't designed to be another conversation about race,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not same-old same-old. If we begin to change social norms regarding race, then the actual 'best places' to have these conversations start to become the same place we currently have less-charged conversations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Conversation We'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When: 7 p.m. Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where: Winchester Thurston School, 555 Morewood Ave., Shadyside 15213.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the senseless, violent death of Jeff Higham in Jackson Ward at the hands of three street thugs: This young man had everything going for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black-on-black violence is the scourge of our cities and yet I read little about the tragedy of this malady and what our illustrious politicians intend to do about the innocent lives lost to this type of crime. Higham's death is an outrage, but I don't see Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson or even President Obama expressing concern over this young man's death. I ask myself why -- and the only answer I can find is that his death does not fit within their divisive politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I find despicable the silence of all politicians and the mainstream media that let them get away with not addressing this issue. We are in the midst of constant media coverage of George Zimmerman's killing of Trayvon Martin, a death that drew extensive comments from Obama, Sharpton and Jackson. I hear nothing about Higham's death from these leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of any young person is tragic and my heart goes out to the parents of both Higham and Martin. But it's time to end the selective outrage and race-baiting politics and address the problems that are truly destroying our cities. Higham's death cannot mean little to the public or our leaders. His legacy cannot be only a crime statistic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. Barton Hinkle's July 3 column, &quot;Commit any felonies lately?&quot; provided a timely commentary right before the Fourth of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fireworks and barbecues are wonderful, but Independence Day is ultimately about remembering and celebrating the importance of freedom. If Hinkle's list of recent civil-liberties abuses prompts readers to do something to help preserve liberty (whether it's attending a city council meeting, contacting representatives, volunteering for a political campaign or civil liberties organization, or even just writing a letter to the editor) then he has honored Independence Day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blame Congress, not the president</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In your editorial &quot;Green Blues,&quot; you correctly acknowledge the need for government action to limit greenhouse-gas (GHG) pollution, even as you criticize President Obama's announced plans to reduce GHG emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the president can do only what the law permits. Your criticism that taxing GHG emissions would be more efficient should be aimed at Congress, since only Congress can enact a GHG tax. And before criticizing the president, name the Republicans who would support a GHG tax or who would even allow such a proposal to come up for a vote in the House or Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Republicans are prepared to acknowledge the science and take reasonable steps to protect our children and grandchildren, instead of defending the status quo and their big donors, the president should do whatever the law permits him to do to restrain GHG pollution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does absolute power corrupt absolutely? Well, let's see. President Obama just returned from his trip to Africa, family and friends in tow, to the tune of $100 million. However, our dear president must cut back on some military perks, such as water parks and swimming pools for our soldiers, in order to save a reported $2.3 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are those incredible salaries lavished upon too many administrators in our colleges and universities. And if that doesn't confound one enough, the outrageous increases in CEO pay and benefits over the past decade, if not longer, should just make one sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isn't it interesting that people at the highest levels of employment (public, private and political) seem to have few if any restrictions to their personal gain at what very well might be every other person's expense? I think the answer is yes.</SPAN></P>
