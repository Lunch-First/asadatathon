<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A New York City police officer involved in the arrest of a man who died in custody after being placed in an apparent chokehold has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty, police said Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Daniel Pantaleo, an eight-year NYPD veteran, and an officer who has been with the force for four years were both taken off the street after the death Thursday of 43-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Staten Island, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department would not identify the second officer but said he would retain his gun and badge while on desk duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the city's largest police union, called Pantaleo's reassignment a &quot;completely unwarranted, knee-jerk reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partial video of the encounter obtained by the New York Daily News shows the 6-foot-3, 350-pound Garner becoming irate and refusing to be handcuffed as officers tried to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed, loose cigarettes on a sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video then shows one of the officers placing Garner in what Police Commissioner William Bratton said Friday appeared to be a chokehold. The tactic, which can be fatal, is prohibited by departmental policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department disclosed Pantaleo's reassignment hours after Garner's wife, Esaw, burst into tears at a Harlem rally where the Rev. Al Sharpton said that the death could strain the black community's relationship with the Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is going to be a real test to see where policies are in the city now and whether the change that we feel occurred has occurred,&quot; Sharpton said, referring to promises made by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bratton to improve the relationship between officers and the city's minority communities. &quot;We are the only ones in the social setup that has to deal with fear of cops and robbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas Gov. Rick Perry is visiting Iowa for the fourth time in eight months this weekend, hoping for a second chance to win over Republican voters who delivered him a stinging caucus loss when he ran for president two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Airways mechanics and ground workers Saturday approved a three-year contract with American Airlines. The contract, which covers 11,000 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists, includes furlough protection and 3 percent raises in each year of the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appeals court Saturday granted Arizona death-row inmate Joseph Wood's request to postpone his execution until prison officials reveal the two-drug combination that will be used to put him to death. Wood is scheduled to be executed for the 1989 shooting deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia has placed a U.S. lawmaker and 12 other people connected with the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq on its list of those banned from entering the country. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saturday that Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., was banned in response to the July 2 U.S. ban on a Russian parliament member.</SPAN></P>
