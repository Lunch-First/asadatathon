COPS PUT a 22-year-old Harlem fare-beater in a chokehold three days before 
 was killed, a shocking new video reveals.
The video shows transit cops taking Ronalds Johns down (photo l.), using the forbidden move and then punching him in the face during the July 14 skirmish. He was also pepper-sprayed, officials said.
Johns was arrested for sneaking through an emergency exit and refusing to show ID, cops said.
The NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating.
