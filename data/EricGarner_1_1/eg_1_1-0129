<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- Four emergency responders have been put on modified duty while authorities investigate their response to a man, suspected of selling untaxed cigarettes, who died after New York police put him in a chokehold, a fire department official said on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians will not be permitted to respond to 911 calls while the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was 43, is investigated, the fire department official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not a department spokesman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's death, the cause of which is still being determined by the city's medical examiner, has provoked outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, who promised to improve frayed relations between police and the public when he took office in January, called the death a &quot;terrible tragedy&quot; and promised a &quot;thorough&quot; investigation by the Staten Island district attorney and the police department's internal affairs bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four suspended emergency workers are not employees of the fire department but work for a Staten Island hospital, the fire department official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois legalizes medical marijuana for children with seizures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois children and adults with epilepsy will soon be allowed to use marijuana to ease their symptoms under a law signed on Sunday by Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, the latest in a series of measures loosening restrictions on cannabis by U.S. states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move to add epilepsy and other seizure disorders to the list of conditions legal to treat with marijuana or its extracts comes as numerous states have made medical use of the drug legal. Two states, Colorado and Washington, have legalized its recreational use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This new law will help alleviate the suffering of many adults and children across the state,&quot; Quinn said in statement. &quot;Epilepsy is a debilitating condition, and this much-needed relief will help to reduce some of its symptoms for those who endure seizures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Illinois law, which takes effect in January, would allow children who experience seizures to be treated with non-smokable forms of cannabis, as long as they have permission from a parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two police officers involved have also been put on desk duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamas says Israeli soldier captured; Gaza death toll jumps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM -- Hamas's armed wing said on Sunday it had captured an Israeli soldier, as fighting in Gaza led to the bloodiest losses in a nearly two-week military offensive, with some 100 Palestinians and 13 Israeli soldiers killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Israeli military said it was checking on the reported capture, which was announced in a Hamas television broadcast. Israeli television stations ignored the report in their extended evening programming about the offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Qassam Brigades captured a Zionist soldier,&quot; said Abu Ubaida, the masked spokesman of the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, who identified the soldier as Shaul Aron and recited what he said was Aron's identity tag number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">He provided no other evidence the soldier was in the custody of the Islamist militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ubaida said the capture happened during the same battle in which 13 Israeli soldiers died earlier, near Shejaia, the embattled neighborhood east of the city of Gaza where most of the Palestinian casualties occurred on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-day death toll was the highest for the Israeli military's since a 2006 war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. It also represented the most Palestinians killed since fighting began on July 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aron would be the first Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza since 2011, when Israel released about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners to free Gilad Shalit, a soldier who was held for more than five years after his 2006 capture in a cross-border raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cries of celebration and fireworks were heard around Gaza shortly after the Hamas broadcast on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of carrying out a massacre in Shejaia and declared three days of mourning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel's army said it had been targeting militants from Gaza's dominant Hamas group, whom it alleged had fired rockets from Shejaia and built tunnels and command centers there. The army said it had warned locals two days earlier to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army sources said seven of the 13 Israeli soldiers were in an armored personnel carrier hit by anti-tank fire. Others were killed setting up positions inside houses they had taken over, the sources added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">From wire service reports</SPAN></P>
