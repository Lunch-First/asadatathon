NEW YORK, N.Y. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is promising a full investigation into the death of a man who appeared to have been put in a choke hold when police officers tried to arrest him. 
Part of 
 encounter with police was captured on amateur video. Police say the 43-year-old father of six went into cardiac arrest while he was being arrested in Staten Island on Thursday on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes.
Video obtained by the New York Daily News shows an officer placing what appears to be a choke hold on the 6-foot-3, 350-pound (1.9-meter, 159-kilogram) Garner and several other officers pinning him against the sidewalk and struggling to put him in handcuffs.
Garner can be heard saying that he can't breathe before he apparently loses consciousness.
