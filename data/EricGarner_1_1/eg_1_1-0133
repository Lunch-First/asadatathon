<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - New York City police say two officers involved in the arrest of a man who died in custody are being placed on modified duty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police identified one of the officers Saturday as Daniel Pantaleo. They say he's an eight-year veteran of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner William Bratton says an officer with four years on the job is also being assigned to desk duty while 43-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death is investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police haven't identified that officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police union called Pantaleo's reassignment a &quot;completely unwarranted, knee-jerk reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities say Garner went into cardiac arrest while being arrested on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes in Staten Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video shows the 350-pound Garner becoming irate and refusing to be handcuffed. An officer then places him in what Bratton says appeared to be a chokehold.</SPAN></P>
