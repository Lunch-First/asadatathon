<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 city residents have accused the NYPD of putting them in chokeholds in the past five years, the Civilian Complaint Review Board said Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startling numbers were revealed as new CCRB Chairman Richard Emery said the panel plans to conduct a &quot;comprehensive study&quot; of chokehold complaints and find out why cops are apparently still using the forbidden practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chokehold study will be an &quot;agency priority,&quot; according to board executive director Tracy Catapano-Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of July 1, the CCRB had received 58 chokehold complaints against the NYPD this year, but it had only substantiated one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 1,022 chokehold allegations reported between 2009 and 2013, only 462 of the complaints were investigated. Of that number, just nine were substantiated, according to the CCRB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There wasn't enough evidence to prove a chokehold was used in 206 of the cases investigated, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCRB will review all of the previous chokehold cases to determine what led to its use and whether anyone was harmed.</SPAN></P>
