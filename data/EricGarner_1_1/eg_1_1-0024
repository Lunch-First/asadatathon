<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DEFENSELESS dad, lying handcuffed and unresponsive on a sidewalk, received zero medical help from cops who instead just emptied his pockets, a shocking new video shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven-minute clip posted Saturday on YouTube shows an apparently lifeless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose head droops to the side as at least eight cops stand nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;C'mon guy,&quot; one cop says to Garner, the only thing on the video that suggests any of the officers was trying to help the Staten Island man. &quot;Breathe in, breathe out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Garner, on his side with his eyes closed, doesn't move at all - even when the officer slaps him on the shoulder. The side of his head remains flat against the concrete, and his eyes never open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, another officer is seen taking a cell phone and a pack of cigarettes from the 43-year-old Garner's pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after the arrival of an EMT four minutes into the video, no medical aid is provided to Garner. He's instead just loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops say he was pronounced dead a short time later after arriving at a Staten Island hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Officer Daniel Pantaleo, caught on another video putting Garner in a chokehold, is shown standing a few feet away and chatting amiably with a uniformed colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the end of the clip, he gives a satiric wave to the person shooting the second video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran, was placed on modified duty Saturday as cops and the Staten Island district attorney investigated the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo was stripped of his gun and his shield and assigned to work desk duty. The police union immediately denounced the move as &quot;knee-jerk&quot; and &quot;completely unwarranted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But detectives arrived at his Staten Island home Saturday afternoon, leaving about 25 minutes later with one box and three bags taken from the residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Justin Damico, on the force four years, was also pulled off the street - but he was not forced to turn in his badge or his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside Damico's home Saturday, an infuriated woman screamed at reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Get off my f------ property! F------ retards!&quot; she howled. &quot;One picture of me and I'll sue you!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources told the Daily News there were no signs of neck trauma, such as a crushed windpipe, on the heavyset victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no indication this is death by strangulation or asphyxia,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another source said the likely cause of death will be a heart attack, although other actions - including the illegal takedown of Garner - &quot;will probably go down as contributing factors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's medical examiner would not confirm the preliminary findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton was irate after getting a look at a video from the Thursday afternoon tragedy near the Staten Island ferry terminal, another source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation will determine in part whether the cops were justified in their decision to jump Garner - and one source indicated they were not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tactically, very little was done right,&quot; the source said. &quot;The first two cops (Pantaleo and Damico) didn't engage Garner . . . They appear to know him. Do something to put him at ease.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sergeant caught standing nearby in the video could be nailed for &quot;failure to supervise,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's devastated wife, Esaw, collapsed in the arms of her family with a piercing wail Saturday at a Harlem rally organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh my God!&quot; she shouted before tumbling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The widow, along with Garner's mother, daughter, and sister, sobbed loudly as Sharpton demanded justice for the family and the late father of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no justification at all on this chokehold,&quot; he said. &quot;And there is clearly no reason, when a man is saying 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe,' that you maintain this chokehold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor de Blasio spoke on the phone with Esaw Garner and the dead man's mother, Gwen Carr, a spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mayor de Blasio called Mr. Garner's wife and mother (Saturday) morning to offer his condolences,&quot; said de Blasio spokeswoman Marti Adams. &quot;He reassured the family that the city is doing everything possible to ensure a full and thorough investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A funeral for Garner was set for Wednesday at Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first video, obtained by the Daily News, captured Garner complaining that he couldn't breathe as Pantaleo applies the chokehold and other cops take him to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops were investigating whether Garner was illegally selling &quot;loosies&quot; - untaxed single cigarettes. He had three full packs of cigarettes and one opened pack of untaxed smokes when police approached him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Staten Island rally attended by about 500 people Saturday afternoon, Garner's sister said the minor transgression hardly justified the police response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people that own stores sell illegal cigarettes,&quot; said Ellisha Flagg. &quot;They lose their license, not their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's rap sheet includes 31 arrests dating to his first at age 16, cops said.</SPAN></P>
