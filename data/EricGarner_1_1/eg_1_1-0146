<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Evoking memories of a more troubling era, the NYPD finds itself under mounting criticism over the death of a Staten Island man whom police were arresting for selling illegal cigarettes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mayor de Blasio warned it's &quot;too early to jump to any conclusions&quot; about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a 400-pound asthmatic who suffered a fatal heart attack while resisting arrest.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mayor added he found a video showing the man in an apparent chokehold &quot;very troubling&quot; - and raised questions about how cops are to respond when called to enforce the law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Councilman Jumaane Williams called it a clear-cut case of cop brutality. Meanwhile, Al Sharpton plans to appear with Garner's relatives to demand an investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner's death is a tragedy. No one should die while being arrested. But it doesn't automatically make the NYPD culpable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Police Commissioner Bill Bratton noted, plainclothes cops - acting on repeated complaints from local merchants - told Garner they were going to arrest him. Garner, in turn, &quot;made it quite clear he would not allow himself to be arrested.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bratton added, &quot;I do not expect my officers to walk away&quot; in that kind of situation, especially when, as in Garner's case, they are physically resisted while &quot;in performance of their lawful duties.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We'll be watching to see what investigators conclude about the force police used.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until all the facts are in, we share a view Ed Koch once expressed: Mayors are &quot;obliged&quot; to presume cops accused of brutality during an arrest have &quot;engaged in the lawful use of appropriate force, unless circumstances are clearly to the contrary.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
