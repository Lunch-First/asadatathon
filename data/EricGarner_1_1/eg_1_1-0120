<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decades after gray seals were all but wiped out in New England waters, the population has rebounded so much that some frustrated residents are calling for a controlled hunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once-thriving New England gray seal population was decimated by the mid-20th century because of hunting, with Massachusetts keeping a seal bounty on the books until the 1960s. But scientists say conservation efforts, an abundance of food and migration from Canada combined to revive the population. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists cheer the resurgence, saying the gray seal boost is good for biodiversity and a boon for popular seal-watch tours in coastal New England. But many fishermen say the seals interfere with fishing charters and steal catch. Beachgoers bemoan the 600-plus-pound seals taking over large stretches of shore, befouling beaches and attracting sharks, which feed on seals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some residents of Nantucket are so fed up with the huge seal population that now calls the affluent island home that they have suggested a controlled hunt, similar to the way states manage deer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists scoff at the idea of providing amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which protects seals. They say culling the herd would undo the results of the act.</SPAN></P>
