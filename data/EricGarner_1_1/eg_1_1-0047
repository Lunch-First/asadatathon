<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUNCHEON, South Korea -- South Korea's most wanted man, whose heavily decomposed body was found in an orchard last month, had evaded arrest by hiding behind an upstairs wall of a wooden cabin, with suitcases of cash at hand, prosecutors said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of Yoo Byung-eun, 73, wanted in connection with the sinking of a ferry in April, was only identified this week, more than a month after he was found lying next to a copy of a book he had written, empty bottles of alcohol nearby, ending the country's biggest and most dramatic manhunt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did all we could to find Yoo and are devastated we couldn't find him alive,&quot; Kim Hoe-jong, a senior prosecutor, said at a media briefing in Incheon, the city west of Seoul where the ferry began its last voyage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two months, wanted posters offering a reward for Yoo's capture faded under the summer sun or disintegrated in the rain while thousands of police combed the country looking for a man who co-founded a church, held an exhibition of photographs at the Louvre in Paris and did jail time for fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 12, the same day farmer Park Yoon-seok found Yoo's body in his plum orchard, thousands of police and prosecutors were busy raiding Yoo's sprawling religious compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoo headed the family that owned the company that operated the Sewol, a ferry that capsized April 16 on a journey to the holiday island of Jeju, killing about 300 people, most of them high school students, and triggering an outpouring of grief across the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head doctor fighting an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone has caught the disease, one of a growing list of medical workers infected while battling to halt its spread across West Africa.</SPAN></P>
