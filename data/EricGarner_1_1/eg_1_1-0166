<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal affairs investigators and prosecutors opened inquiries into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death outside a beauty salon in Staten Island, one of New York City's five boroughs. Garner, 43, had a heart attack as he struggled with officers trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partial video of the confrontation shows an officer placing what appears to be a choke hold on the 1.9m, 159kg Garner, who can be heard complaining repeatedly that he can't breathe as at least four other officers bring him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then apparently loses -consciousness.&quot;We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD,&quot; Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement, expressing his condolences to Mr Garner's family.</SPAN></P>
