<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of a father of six after he was put into a chokehold by a New York police officer has stoked racial tensions and drawn comparisons to the case of Rodney King, which sparked riots after he&nbsp; was beaten by officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, was seized by five officers after he was stopped on the street for selling untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video of the incident, which has gone viral, shows Mr Garner pleading &quot;I can't breathe&quot; as his head is pressed against the pavement with his eyes closed. He died an hour later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two police officers and four paramedics have since been suspended following protests over the weekend and calls for the officer responsible, Daniel Pantaleo, to face punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven minute footage of Mr Garner's death, which took place near Tompkinsville Park on Staten Island, has been watched more than 500,000 times on YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Garner is heard to say he has &quot;done nothing&quot; and argues with police for trying to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes after the dispute four officer pounce upon him and they tussle to the floor, with Mr Mr Pantaleo on Mr Garner's back with his arms around his neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers can be heard saying &quot;Something's wrong with him&quot; but make no attempt to revive him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the paramedics arrive they check for a pulse but do little else before loading Mr Garner onto a stretcher and putting him in an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has said Mr Pantaleo used a chokehold even though they are banned by the force and has ordered police Internal Affairs&nbsp; officers to investigate. There have been claims Mr Garner was resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His funeral was held yesterday in an emotional service at a Baptist church in Brooklyn, after a Harlem rally last weekend in which civil rights campaigner the Rev Al Sharpton spoke to a crowd which included his widow Esaw, who collapsed in tears. He said: &quot;Even if police procedures don't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick in? Have we gotten so cold?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York commentator Denis Hamill said the video was &quot;disturbing proof of how far we have not come since Rodney King&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King was beaten by Los Angeles police officers after a high-speed car chase in 1991. The beating was captured on film and the later acquittals of four officers triggered riots a year later in which 53 people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's mayor Bill de Blasio has delayed a holiday in Italy to also start an investigation. He has pledged to restore relations between police and the black community, who claim &quot;stop and frisk&quot; tactics unfairly target them.</SPAN></P>
