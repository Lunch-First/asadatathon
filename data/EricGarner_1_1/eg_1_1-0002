<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEARS FLOWED FREELY Wednesday as friends and family attended the wake and funeral for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Staten Island father who died on a city street after an NYPD cop put him in an illegal chokehold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowds from the Gowanus Houses, where Garner grew up, and relatives from Staten Island packed into Bethel Baptist Church in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, to pay their respects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died last Thursday as cops tried to cuff him for allegedly selling bootleg cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk. A cell phone recording captured the asthmatic father of six repeating the words: &quot;I can't breathe!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cop can be seen putting Garner in a chokehold, a move prohibited by the NYPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 350-pound Garner, known among his friends and family as a gentle giant, lay in a white coffin inscribed with the words: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in God's Care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was dressed in a white silk suit with a silk turquoise shirt. His family, including wife Esaw (Pinky) Garner and their children, arrived in a stretch limo about 5:30 p.m. with a police escort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's mother traveled behind them in her own stretch limo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simple floral arrangements surrounded the casket, including one in the shape of a crucifix on the right and a wreath on the left. At the foot of his coffin was a bouquet with a gold ribbon around it reading, &quot;Beloved Brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner and two of her sons entered wearing white slacks and turquoise silk shirts that matched those Garner wore in his casket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grieving woman had to be helped to the altar to take a last look at her beloved spouse. She collapsed clutching the dead man's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My God, they took him. They took my baby. They took my baby,&quot; she sobbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members carried her to the front pew, where she was able to nod and shake hands as she received a steady stream of condolences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to miss him so much,&quot; she said fanning herself in the sweltering heat. &quot;He cared for everybody. He didn't deserve this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was supposed to be my rock,&quot; she said breaking down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now he is gone. He will never answer my call. I just want to cry,&quot; she said, slumping into the arms of Gwen Carr, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son, my son, I love him so,&quot; Carr said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A live gospel band performed for the mourners, giving them an extended version of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; while they waited for the Rev. Al Sharpton to speak. Handheld fans fluttered and shouts of &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; floated to the rafters as music filled the holy space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton arrived at 8 p.m. to deliver his remarks in honor of Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who also came to pay their respects was Kadiatou Diallo, the mother of Amadou Diallo, who was fatally shot 19 times by cops in the Bronx 1999 when they mistook his wallet for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just so sad. It brings back terrible memories. After all these cases and all these years, nothing seems to change,&quot; she told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should never have happened, it should have been prevented,&quot; she added of Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm calling on the new administration, Mayor de Blasio and (Police) Commissioner (Bill) Bratton, to bring about changes,&quot; Diallo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner's office hasn't yet been able to determine a cause of death for Garner, but a preliminary investigation found there were no clear signs of asphyxiation, police sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner had a history with police and can be seen on the video waving his arms and yelling at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me,&quot; Garner told the cops. &quot;I'm tired of it. It stops today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Staten Island district attorney's office Wednesday dropped cases against Garner from 2013 and earlier this year. He had been charged with possession or sale of untaxed cigarettes and possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former cop, who attended Garner's funeral, said the NYPD reaction had been too strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For small nonviolent crimes, conversation is better than incarceration,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
