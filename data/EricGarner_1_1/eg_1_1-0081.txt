New footage of a brutal arrest that left a man dead shows New York City police standing around and failing to give him medical attention. 
The arrest sparked outrage last week when footage emerged of an officer putting 
, 43, in a chokehold before a group of police roughly brought him down. Garner, who was asthmatic, later died.
A new clip posted Saturday shows officers milling around an apparently lifeless Garner, working only to empty his pockets.
'C'mon, guy,' one cop says, slapping Garner on the shoulder. 'Breathe in, breathe out.'
Police confronted Garner because they suspected he was selling loose, untaxed cigarettes in Staten Island.
The first video to emerge, obtained by the New York Daily News, revealed that Garner said several times that he couldn't breath as the officers pinned him down.
