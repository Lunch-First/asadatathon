A NEW York City police officer who was caught on video putting a man in a chokehold has been stripped of his shield and gun after the man died during the arrest. 
Internal affairs investigators and prosecutors opened inquiries into 
 death outside a beauty salon in Staten Island, one of New York City's five boroughs. Garner, 43, had a heart attack as he struggled with officers trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, police said.
Partial video of the confrontation shows an officer placing what appears to be a choke hold on the 1.9m, 159kg Garner, who can be heard complaining repeatedly that he can't breathe as at least four other officers bring him down.
He then apparently loses -consciousness."We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD," Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement, expressing his condolences to Mr Garner's family.
