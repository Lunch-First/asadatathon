  To go, or not to go? If so, when?  
  A fly on the wall would have heard a frantic debate among Mayor de Blasio's inner circle about his planned trip to Italy. The decision to put it off for a day reflected a belated, if still incomplete, grasp of the complexities, including the optics.  
  To wit, it wouldn't look good for a progressive mayor to be pictured on a European vacation while the city boiled over.  
  The death of a Staten Island man in police custody sparked the delay, but any number of events could have qualified. While there is never a perfect time for a mayor to go away for 10 days, some are decidedly better than others. Six months into the job, during a summer shooting surge, is one of the worst.  
  The police case makes the point. Two of the cops who arrested 
 who is black, and put him in a chokehold were put on desk duty while the DA and the NYPD investigate. The incident was captured on video by a witness, and the mayor rightly called Garner's death a "tragedy." Although he and Police Commissioner William Bratton suggested the cops were wrong, they wisely stopped short of declaring them guilty.  
  Cops, like everybody else in America, are presumed innocent, as former Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg frequently reminded New Yorkers. It's more than a legal point. Cops make split-second decisions of life and death, and too much second-guessing can make them timid.  
  Of course, de Blasio ran on an anti-police agenda, and that raises another question about the vacation: If the Garner case, or one like it, happened while he was away, would he rush home to deal with it?  
  The correct answer is yes, which is why he shouldn't have gone.
