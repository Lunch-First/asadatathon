<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A man's death after a possible police chokehold has prompted a sweeping review of the NYPD's use of force - with &shy;every officer set to be retrained and teams flown to Los Angeles to study the LAPD's tactics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton demanded a &quot;top to bottom&quot; review of police procedure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The department really does need to do a lot more, a lot more, in the area of training,&quot; he said Tuesday. &quot;How do we train our officers for a takedown? How do we train them to use the various levels of force that they're authorized to use: less than lethal, nonlethal, lethal?&quot; added Bratton, the former LA police chief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The commish noted that there have been hundreds - and possibly more than 1,000 - complaints against city cops over neck holds alone in the past several years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Staten Island dad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died Thursday after a cop trying to arrest him possibly put him in an illegal chokehold.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the cop, Daniel Pantaleo, may escape serious charges in the case - because his hands never appeared to lock around Garner's neck, police sources told The Post Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NYPD probers &quot;are trying to determine whether it was technically &quot;a chokehold or a submission hold,&quot; an important distinction, because chokeholds are specifically barred under department guidelines, a source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rules don't refer to &quot;submission holds,&quot; which include headlocks, a common practice by city cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;That's something that's in play,'' the source said. &quot;If you look at the video, the officer has one arm around his neck and the other arm is hooked underneath Garner's arm. Does this meet the criteria of a chokehold?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A preliminary autopsy has shown that neither Garner's windpipe nor neck bones were damaged in the encounter. Still, the hold around his neck could have caused his death by aggravating the 6-foot-5, 350-pound man's pre-existing conditions, which included diabetes, obesity and asthma, according to sources from the Medical Examiner's Office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Authorities are still awaiting the final results of the autopsy, which may not be completed for up to two weeks while the ME conducts toxicology tests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, the FBI is &quot;monitoring'' the NYPD's probe into Garner's death - and may open its own investigation, law- enforcement sources said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The feds are so concerned about the handling of the case that the head of the FBI's New York office, George Venizelos, personally talked with Bratton, a source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the issues into which the feds would be looking is whether any civil-rights violations were committed by the cops against Garner, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
