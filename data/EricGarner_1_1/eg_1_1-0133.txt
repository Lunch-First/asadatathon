NEW YORK (AP) - New York City police say two officers involved in the arrest of a man who died in custody are being placed on modified duty. 
Police identified one of the officers Saturday as Daniel Pantaleo. They say he's an eight-year veteran of the force.
Commissioner William Bratton says an officer with four years on the job is also being assigned to desk duty while 43-year-old 
 death is investigated.
Police haven't identified that officer.
The police union called Pantaleo's reassignment a "completely unwarranted, knee-jerk reaction."
Authorities say Garner went into cardiac arrest while being arrested on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes in Staten Island.
Video shows the 350-pound Garner becoming irate and refusing to be handcuffed. An officer then places him in what Bratton says appeared to be a chokehold.
