<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 city residents have accused the NYPD of putting them in chokeholds in the past five years, the Civilian Complaint Review Board said Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startling numbers were revealed as new CCRB Chair Richard Emery said the board plans to conduct a &quot;comprehensive study&quot; of chokehold complaints and find out why cops are apparently still using the forbidden practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chokehold study will be an &quot;agency priority,&quot; according to CCRB Executive Director Tracy Catapano-Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of July 1, the CCRB had received 58 chokehold complaints against the NYPD this year, but had only substantiated one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the 1,022 chokehold allegations reported between 2008 and 2013, only 462 of the complaints were investigated. Out of that number, just nine were substantiated, according to the CCRB.</SPAN></P>
