<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD -- Islamist insurgents have issued an ultimatum to northern Iraq's dwindling Christian population to convert to Islam, pay a religious levy or face death, according to a statement distributed in the militant-controlled city of Mosul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement issued by the Islamic State, the al-Qaida offshoot that led last month's lightning assault to capture swaths of north Iraq, said the ruling would go into effect Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said Christians who wanted to remain in the caliphate that the Islamic State declared this month in parts of Iraq and Syria must agree to abide by terms of a dhimma contract -- a historic practice under which non-Muslims were protected in Muslim lands in return for a special levy known as jizya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We offer them three choices: Islam; the dhimma contract, involving payment of jizya; if they refuse this they will have nothing but the sword,&quot; the announcement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resident of Mosul said the statement, issued in the name of the Islamic State in Iraq's northern province of Nineveh, had been distributed Thursday and read in mosques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi set a Saturday deadline for Christians who did not want to stay and live under those terms to &quot;leave the borders of the Islamic Caliphate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mosul, once home to diverse faiths, had a Christian population of about 100,000 a decade ago, but waves of attacks on Christians since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein have seen those numbers collapse.</SPAN></P>
