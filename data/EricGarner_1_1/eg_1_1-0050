<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the sun set over Brooklyn on Wednesday, hundreds of people gathered to mourn a man who died after begging for air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can't breathe,'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had said over and over again last Thursday, after he was apparently placed in a chokehold by the police and wrestled to the ground, accused of illegally peddling cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments earlier, Mr. Garner, 43, had been pleading with officers to leave him alone, saying he felt harassed and mistreated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This ends today,'' he said. Less than an hour later, he was dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was all caught on video and, now, his final words have become a rallying cry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the sweltering sanctuary of Bethel Baptist Church -- where Mr. Garner's mother and stepfather are members -- relatives, friends and supporters filled the pews up to the balcony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Garner's family sat in the front rows, facing the white coffin that held his body. When one of his daughters rose to give a speech, she was overcome with emotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The only thing my daughter asked for her birthday is for her Pop-Pop to make the cake,'' she said from the pulpit. ''I just don't know how I'm going to explain to her that Pop-Pop is not going to make the cake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who gathered at the church made it clear they viewed his death as tragic, avoidable and emblematic of systemic problems in the relationship between the police and some communities they serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This here was absolutely murder,'' Estelle Queenie Smith, one of Mr. Garner's neighbors, said as she entered the church for a viewing before the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton arrived at the funeral shortly after it began and announced both outside and in a fiery address from the pulpit that on Friday he, Mr. Garner's family and their lawyers would meet with representatives from the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York to ask for a federal civil rights investigation into his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Yes, God will make a way,'' he said, ''but God expects something of us. When you can in broad daylight choke one of God's children, he expects us to stand up and demand justice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton drew several standing ovations, including when he asked Ramsey Orta, the man who took the video of last Thursday's confrontation, to join him at the pulpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sensing the volatility of the situation, both the police and City Hall have moved quickly to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose campaign was built around his pledge to end the police tactic known as stop and frisk, delayed a vacation by a day and said there would be a thorough investigation. On Tuesday, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton announced that he was ordering a sweeping review of the department's training and tactics. Letitia James, the city's public advocate, was among the city officials at the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the video of the arrest, Officer Daniel Pantaleo was shown wrapping his arm around the neck of Mr. Garner, who was on a Staten Island street corner, arguing with the police and objecting to being arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has banned the use of chokeholds since 1993. In 1994, a Bronx man was killed by an officer using the grip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the ban, complaints of officers' using chokeholds have steadily come before the Civilian Complaint Review Board. From 2009 to 2013, the board received 1,022 such complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police said Wednesday that Internal Affairs detectives were investigating an arrest on July 14, captured on cellphone video, in which an officer appears to use a chokehold to restrain a 22-year-old man seen skipping the fare in the 125th Street and Lexington Avenue subway station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday, after Officer Pantaleo grabbed hold of Mr. Garner, the two men tumbled to the ground as several other officers swarmed on top of them. Mr. Garner was heard on the video saying that he could not breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two emergency medical technicians and the two paramedics who responded to Mr. Garner, and appeared to be moving without urgency, have been suspended without pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellisha Flagg, Mr. Garner's sister, said at a vigil at Tompkinsville Park on Tuesday that the apparent chokehold quite likely exacerbated the effects of her brother's asthma, a condition he had had since childhood. Autopsy results are still pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remembrances, friends and neighbors recalled Mr. Garner as a gentle man who may have scrambled to make a few extra dollars but who would never have hurt anyone. He married his college sweetheart, Esaw, with whom he has five children, and worked security in nightclubs to provide for them. But he struggled to stay employed because of respiratory problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He was a big giant, but a real teddy bear,'' Ms. Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before and just after Mr. Sharpton's appearance, a crowd of around 100 demonstrators on the sidewalks protested. A woman cried out, ''One day it's going to be your murder!'' A man shouting ''They killed him'' was escorted off the block by men in orange shirts that said, ''I Am Present for Peace.'' Part of the crowd chanted, ''No more.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Stop killing us,'' a woman said to the face of a police captain. ''And tell your friends to stop killing us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''O.K.,'' he replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the funeral, Mr. Garner's widow hobbled slowly from the church, her arm held by a son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes earlier, 10 burly pallbearers carried Mr. Garner's coffin through a drizzle and into a black hearse. Nearby, family members hugged and wept. A voice from the crowd called out, ''I can't breathe!''</SPAN></P>
