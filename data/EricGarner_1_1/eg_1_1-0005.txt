THE NYPD COP who put 
 in a chokehold allegedly strip-searched two men in public following a traffic stop, according to documents obtained by the Daily News. 
Darren Collins and Tommy Rice filed papers against Officer Daniel Pantaleo with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
In their filing, Collins, 46, and Rice, 43, said Pantaleo also "slapped" and "tapped" their testicles in broad daylight.
Pantaleo and three other plainclothes cops pulled over their Nissan Maxima about 10:50 a.m. on March 22, 2012.
The cops claimed to have witnessed a hand-to-hand drug deal involving the men.
After they exited their vehicle, the men told the review board, "PO Pantaleo then removed Mr. Rice's belt, causing Mr. Rice's pants to sag down to the middle of his thigh. PO Pantaleo pulled Mr. Rice's pants down to his knees and then pulled his boxer shorts down."
Pantaleo then slapped Rice's private parts, the documents allege.
"Pantaleo stated that he was attempting to shake out any contraband Mr. Rice might be hiding," the documents allege.
Collins provided the Civilian Complaint Review Board investigators with a similar account of the strip search. No drugs were found on either Collins or Rice, but a third person in the car was in possession of heroin.
Pantaleo denied he pulled down anyone's pants or underwear or touched their testicles, according to the documents. In the end, the allegation was deemed unsubstantiated - it could not be proved or disproved - because it was the word of Collins and Rice against the cops.
Criminal charges against Rice and Collins were later dismissed. They settled a federal lawsuit for $15,000 each this year.
