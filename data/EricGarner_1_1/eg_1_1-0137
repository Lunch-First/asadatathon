<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The forbidden chokehold used by a cop to take down a Staten Island man in a deadly encounter did not damage his windpipe or neck bones, sources said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The preliminary autopsy findings could be welcome news for Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo, now named as the cop who wrapped his arm around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> throat while trying to &shy;arrest him Thursday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If you're the defense counsel in this case, this is very good news, because it's consistent with what appears to be the case - that they didn't mean to hurt him,&quot; said John Jay College Professor Eugene O'Donnell.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a source close to the ME investigation said coroners are also investigating whether the chokehold still caused Garner's death by aggravating his pre-existing conditions of obesity, asthma, and possible heart disease. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If an obese person with co-existing medical problems can't get good oxygenation to begin with, then a chokehold could put him over the edge,&quot; and lead to a homicide finding, the source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pantaleo has been placed on modified duty, his shield and gun taken. Saturday, cops gath&shy;ered evidence at his Staten Island home, leaving with a long, narrow box and three bags. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The eight-year NYPD veteran, along with Police Officer Justin Damico, a four-year vet, had been on patrol for &quot;conditions&quot; such as drug use, public intoxication and illegal cigarette sales at about 5 p.m. Thursday when they spotted the 6-foot-5, 350-pound Garner at his usual perch at Bay Street and Victory Boulevard in Tompkinsville. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cops saw him sell a &quot;loosie&quot; to a man in a red shirt, law-enforcement sources said. Garner was known to hawk untaxed cigarettes for 50 cents apiece, and had eight &shy;arrests for the offense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Witnesses claimed Garner had done nothing but break up a fight prior to the officers arriving.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The guy got punched in the back, and [Garner] jumped up to break it up,&quot; said Ramsey Orta, 22. &quot;I know he didn't sell a cigarette because the guy in the red shirt, who got punched, asked me for a cigarette.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the videotaped confrontation, Garner is heard hollering at the two cops, &quot;Every time you see me, you try to mess with me. I'm tired of it. This ends today.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the cops move in, Garner protests, &quot;Please don't touch me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The plainclothes, 5-foot- 10 Pantaleo then steps behind Garner, wraps his arm around his neck and pulls him to the sidewalk. As other cops join the scrum, Pantaleo is seen pushing the suspect's head against the sidewalk as Garner repeatedly gasps, &quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner, an asthmatic who had a long rap sheet of more than 30 petty crimes, along with three open cigarette-sales cases, died of cardiac arrest en route to a hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NYPD protocol prohibits the use of chokeholds.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even without damage to the throat, &quot;the chokehold alone is pretty damning,&quot; said civil rights lawyer Ronald Kuby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Patrick Lynch, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, urged New Yorkers to &quot;[give] our police the benefit of the doubt when a tragedy occurs in the performance of their duty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The department's modification of this police officer under these circumstances is a completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons and nothing more,&quot; Lynch added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The death prompted 250 people to rally on Staten Island Saturday, as Garner's outraged family marched with the Rev. Al Sharpton and several politicians from a community center to the 120th Precinct station house. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;A cigarette, really? A cigarette? Are you serious?&quot; Garner's sister, Ellisha Flagg, told the crowd.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Many people who own stores sell illegal cigarettes. They lose their &shy;license, not their lives.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, said, &quot;They shouldn't have did this to my son. My son never [hurt] a soul. Never.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the marchers chanted &quot;NYPD KKK.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The family took a condolence call from Mayor Bill de Blasio, who delayed an Italian vacation by a day because of the incident.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He &quot;reassured the family that the city is doing everything possible to ensure a full and thorough investigation,&quot; said spokeswoman Marti Adams. </SPAN></P>
