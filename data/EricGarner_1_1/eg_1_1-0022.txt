 isn't alone.
More than 1,000 city residents have accused the NYPD of putting them in chokeholds in the past five years, the Civilian Complaint Review Board said Saturday. 
The startling numbers were revealed as new CCRB Chairman Richard Emery said the panel plans to conduct a "comprehensive study" of chokehold complaints and find out why cops are apparently still using the forbidden practice.
The chokehold study will be an "agency priority," according to board executive director Tracy Catapano-Fox.
As of July 1, the CCRB had received 58 chokehold complaints against the NYPD this year, but it had only substantiated one.
Of the 1,022 chokehold allegations reported between 2009 and 2013, only 462 of the complaints were investigated. Of that number, just nine were substantiated, according to the CCRB.
There wasn't enough evidence to prove a chokehold was used in 206 of the cases investigated, officials said.
The CCRB will review all of the previous chokehold cases to determine what led to its use and whether anyone was harmed.
