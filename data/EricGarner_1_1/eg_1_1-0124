<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common Sense with Paul Jacob has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a 43-year-old Staten Islander, by police chokehold, not only sparked in me the usual combination of sadness, anger and frustration -- there was an additional element: would this do it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would the nation's shock, incredulity, indignation amount to anything?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots of questions. But one thing not being focused on in the standard reports was noted by Scott Shackford of Reason. It's not merely a question of why the bust went so violent. Why, he asks, a bust at all? &quot;We should be concerned that the reason why the police swarmed Garner in the first place is getting lost. He allegedly possessed 'untaxed cigarettes.' That is it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tax matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are arresting people -- and going into overkill mode in the process -- on tax matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Couldn't this such issues be handled by mere citation, followed by a court summons? With an arrest the last resort?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why go all violent when violence is not really in order?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But maybe it's not just about the taxes. Or &quot;contraband.&quot; Maybe this is also about &quot;drugs.&quot; (Yes, tobacco's a drug.) We've long had a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; in this country. It has not gone well. As I suggested last week (as well as yesterday, on Townhall), the effects have not only been wide and deep, but inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War is like that. Expect the &quot;unintended consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott Shackford suggests that New York lower the city's high sin taxes on cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But maybe the whole mindset of the modern state needs changing. Big things, like murder, slavery, etc., those are worth fighting about. Let's not go to war over the little things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Common Sense. I'm Paul Jacob.</SPAN></P>
