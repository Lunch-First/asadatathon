<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor de Blasio refused to change his Italy vacation plans for a potentially crippling LIRR strike - but suddenly delayed the trip Friday amid outcries for a full investigation into how a Staten Island man died after being arrested.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The mayor will postpone the departure for his upcoming family vacation to Saturday, in order to attend to city business,&quot; City Hall announced just a couple of hours before de Blasio's scheduled &shy;departure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier in the week, when the strike was looming, the mayor argued there was no need to change his getaway plans because &quot;I can be in absolutely immediate touch with all the key figures in the administration whenever needed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   One city official said de Blasio felt it was important to stay in the city Friday night to &quot;consult with community leaders&quot; about the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A City Hall insider said the mayor was also considering &shy;attending rallies sponsored by the Rev. Al Sharpton with Garner's family in Harlem and on Staten &shy;Island Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A plainclothes cop violated department protocol by using a choke hold while handcuffing Garner, who died in an ambulance immediately after the arrest, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That officer and another cop who arrested Garner were both placed on desk duty following Thursday's violent arrest, Bratton said at a City Hall press conference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The Richmond County District Attorney's Office is leading the investigation - the criminal investigation - into this matter, assisted by the NYPD Internal &shy;Affairs Bureau,&quot; Bratton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sources identified the two cops who initiated the arrest as Daniel Pantaleo and Justin Damico, but did not identify which one put Garner in a choke hold.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There's a very high chance that the officer who put him in a choke hold would lose his job,&quot; said a law-enforcement source familiar with the investigation. &quot;It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a choke hold.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police said they forced the 350-pound Garner to the ground and piled atop him at 3:30 p.m. in Tompkinsville because he was selling &shy;untaxed cigarettes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But witnesses told The Post that Garner was not peddling smokes and had actually tried to break up a fight between two people who ran off before cops arrived. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner, a father of six and former parks worker, died of a heart attack in an &shy;ambulance, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  De Blasio said video of the &shy;arrest was &quot;very troubling.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While de Blasio and his family are paying their own way to Italy, taxpayers will shell out about $13,000 for the three staffers joining the trip. </SPAN></P>
