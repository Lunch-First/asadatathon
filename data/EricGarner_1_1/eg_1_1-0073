<P CLASS="c9"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, D.C.--Congressman Gregory W. Meeks (NY-05) today released the following statement about the tragic death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:<BR><BR>&quot;My deepest and sincerest condolences go out to the family - especially to the wife and six children - of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the wake of this appalling tragedy. I stand in solidarity with them and the broader community realizing that Eric could have easily been a father, brother, friend or son of any one of us.<BR><BR>&quot;I call on the leadership of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to complete an extensive and expedited investigation into the apparent aggression of those officers involved. While the visual image of this man's final moments are disturbing, they are, unfortunately, not uncommon in many communities around our country.<BR><BR>&quot;The problem with this incident - and others like it - is that it is part of systemic failures that leave men of color particularly vulnerable to abuse by authorities. In this regard our nation continuously falls short of the very values it was founded upon. We cannot rest when statistics show that African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police. Mistreatment at the hands of those we rely on for protection is an unacceptable reality for too many. I will continue to push for change; too many lives are at stake.&quot; </SPAN></P>
