<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City mayor Bill de Blasio (pictured) is promising a full investigation into the death of a man who appeared to have been put in a choke hold when police officers tried to arrest him. Part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encounter with police was captured on an amateur video. Police say the 43-year-old father of six went into cardiac arrest while being arrested in Staten Island on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes. Video obtained by New York's Daily News shows an officer placing what appears to be a choke hold on the 1.9-metre, 159-kilogram man and several other officers pinning him against the footpath. </SPAN></P>
