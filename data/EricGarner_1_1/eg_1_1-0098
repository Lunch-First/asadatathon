<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emergency Medical Services has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FDNY placed four EMS workers -- two EMTs and two paramedics -- on modified desk duty Sunday as part of the investigation into the death of a Staten Island man who was placed in a chokehold by a police officer while being arrested last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EMS workers, who were not identified, are privately employed by the Richmond University Medical Center, said an official with knowledge of the investigation. They will not be allowed to respond to 911 calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died while in police custody Thursday after being arrested and placed into a chokehold for allegedly selling individual, untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a high-profile case so we're looking at the response and the operation of that case,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Officer Daniel Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran of the NYPD, had his badge and gun taken away and was placed on modified duty, police said. A second, unidentified officer who was present during the incident, was placed on desk duty, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association, the police's union, called Pantaleo's modified duty a &quot;completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons and nothing more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sermon Sunday, Rev. Al Sharpton called on other religious leaders to take action, citing video footage captured during in the incident in which Garner can apparently be heard repeatedly gasping &quot;I can't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
