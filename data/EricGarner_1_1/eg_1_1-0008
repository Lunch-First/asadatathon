<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK'S top cop on Tuesday ordered the retraining of his 35,000 officers in the use of force as an incensed lawmaker called the death of a dad put in a banned chokehold &quot;murder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As protests and cries for justice resounded on the steps of City Hall over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demise in police custody, an autopsy on the asthmatic father of six proved &quot;inconclusive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a murder,&quot; state Sen. Bill Perkins declared at a City Hall rally. &quot;Without even being arrested, he was choked to death. It's outrageous. It's unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died after being taken down by cops, allegedly for selling bootleg cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk. A cell phone video shot by a witness shows him repeatedly pleading &quot;I can't breathe&quot; after being placed in a chokehold by a cop and piled on top of by other officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident has prompted a criminal investigation by the Staten Island district attorney and reviews by other agencies. The NYPD banned chokeholds in 1994 after a Bronx man, Anthony Baez, was killed by an officer who placed him in one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn) blasted the &quot;omissions and lies&quot; in an internal police report on Garner's case detailed in a Daily News front page story Tuesday. The report failed to mention the chokehold and downplayed Garner's distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's Citizen Complaint Review Board revealed Tuesday that two people have lodged complaints against NYPD cops for using chokeholds on them in the wake of Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an afternoon press conference, Police Commissioner Bill Bratton called Garner's death &quot;very tragic&quot; and ordered Deputy Commissioner of Training Benjamin Tucker to conduct a &quot;top-to-bottom&quot; review of instruction on the use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This department clearly needs to do more training,&quot; Bratton said. He anticipates &quot;a retraining of every member of the New York Police Department.&quot; To that end, he plans to dispatch a team to look at using the LAPD's &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; training as a template.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton spent part of Tuesday meeting with community and religious leaders to discuss the Garner incident, and he headed over to Staten Island to meet with police brass there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He vowed the probe into Garner's death will be &quot;thorough and comprehensive,&quot; but also that it will take time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bratton said he met with local FBI officials, saying, &quot;I would not be surprised if the U.S. attorney decides to open a civil rights violation investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's anticipating civil suit brought by Garner's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An autopsy performed on Garner, who was asthmatic and obese, failed to determine a cause of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people held a vigil Tuesday night in a park near where Garner died, then marched to the 120th Precinct stationhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody deserves to die like that, not even a police officer,&quot; Garner's sister, Ellisha Flagg, said on the steps of the precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's funeral will be held 7 p.m. Wednesday at Bethel Baptist Church in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
