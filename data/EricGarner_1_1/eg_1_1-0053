<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tearful family members, elected officials and perfect strangers alike packed the Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn Wednesday to pay their final respects to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who died after scuffling with cops last week.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Oh my God! They took him. They took my baby!&quot; said Garner's wife, Esaw, as she walked up the to casket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The grieving widow arrived at the church at about 5 p.m., flanked by two of the couple's six children, both dressed in matching suits and supporting their distraught mother. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner's mother and sister arrived a short time later in a stretch limousine, also looking devastated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My father meant everything to me,&quot; his daughter said from the pulpit, noting that he will be absent at his granddaughter's birthday next week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hundreds of mourners made their way past Garner as he lay in an open, white casket, dressed in a white suit and a light-blue shirt and tie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He was a good person. He was no thug,&quot; said Nicholas Heyward, 57, who grew up with Garner when the two lived in the Gowanus Houses in Boerum Hill. &quot;He didn't &shy;deserve this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When I realized it was him, I felt a lot of pain. I was angry, upset and disappointed with the actions of the police.&quot; </SPAN></P>
