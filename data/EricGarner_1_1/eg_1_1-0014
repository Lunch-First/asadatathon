<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE GRIEVING son of a man who died after an NYPD officer put him in a chokehold said Sunday he wants to see the cop behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> son, Eric Snipes, 18, spoke out just hours after four emergency workers who responded to Thursday's tragic scene in Staten Island were put on modified duty pending an investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snipes focused his anger on Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the plainclothes cop seen in a viral video putting Garner in a chokehold banned by the NYPD and refusing to let up even when the father of six repeatedly yelled he couldn't breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He should be in jail. No protective custody, either. Put in the (general) population,&quot; Snipes said of Pantaleo, who has been yanked from the streets along with Officer Justin Damico as the investigation into the death of the 350-pound cigarette peddler continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's son said he and his family are still grappling with the senselessness of the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to ask the man that did it, 'What made you choke him like that?' &quot; Snipes said. &quot;What made him put his hand around his bare neck?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snipes also recalled his dad's last words to him the night before he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was telling me how he was proud of me . . . the first person in my family to go to college,&quot; said Snipes, who begins classes at Essex County College in Newark this fall on a basketball scholarship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the outcry over Garner's death continued, four emergency workers were put on modified duty, an FDNY spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EMTs are not Fire Department employees, said agency spokesman Jim Long, but are employed by Richmond University Medical Center - two from its advanced life support unit and two from its basic life support unit. The FDNY did not identify them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four have been banned from responding to calls - at least until the investigation is completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word of the action against the emergency workers came a day after video footage from the scene showed at least eight cops standing idly by as Garner was sprawled, motionless, on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency workers arrived four minutes into the seven-minute clip, yet performed no CPR nor gave Garner oxygen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One emergency worker checked Garner's pulse and told the apparently lifeless man that help had arrived. Cops and the worker lifted Garner onto a stretcher and he was taken to a Staten Island hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton slammed what he called the inhumanity of the officers who gave no aid to Garner, who was being arrested on suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of them said, 'Let's stop. He can't breathe,' &quot; Sharpton told a packed house at the historic Riverside Church. &quot;Even if police procedures don't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick in? Have we gotten so cold?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Famed pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht said Garner could have survived had he been placed upright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to position him in a way to facilitate breathing,&quot; said Wecht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources told the Daily News that a preliminary report found no signs of neck trauma, such as a crushed windpipe.</SPAN></P>
