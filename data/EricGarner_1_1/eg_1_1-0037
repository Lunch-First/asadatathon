Garner, 43, had a heart attack as he struggled with officers trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, police said. Partial video shows an officer placing what appears to be a choke hold on the 6-foot-3, 350-pound Garner, who can be heard complaining that he can't breathe. The video shows the officer who apparently choked Garner using his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk. </SPAN></P>
