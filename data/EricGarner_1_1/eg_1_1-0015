<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOUR EMERGENCY workers who responded to the scene of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deadly Staten Island arrest have been put on modified duty, the Fire Department said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two NYPD cops - Justin Damico and Daniel Pantaleo - involved in the incident had already been pulled from the street Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner, 43, died after one officer put him in a chokehold and other cops helped bring him down after his arrest Thursday in Tompkinsville. He repeatedly called out, &quot;I can't breathe,&quot; then went still, as bystanders videotaped the tragic incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergency workers are not Fire Department employees, FDNY spokesman Jim Long said. They are volunteer workers from Richmond University Medical Center - two from its advanced life support unit and two from its basic life support unit. The FDNY did not identify them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four have been banned from responding to calls made to the city's 911 call system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word of the action against the emergency workers came a day after video footage from the scene showed at least eight cops standing idly by with Garner sprawled on the pavement, not moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after the arrival of emergency workers four minutes into a seven-minute clip posted on YouTube, no CPR is performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, an emergency worker checks Garner's pulse, tells the apparently lifeless man help has arrived and, with several cops, lifts him onto a stretcher. Garner was pronounced dead after arriving at a Staten Island hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton said Sunday he is appalled by the coldness of the officers who gave no aid to Garner, arrested on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of them said, 'Let's stop. He can't breathe,' &quot; Sharpton told a packed house at the historic Riverside Church. &quot;Even if police procedures don't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick in? Have we gotten so cold?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preacher and political pundit compared the Garner incident with the death in 1994 of Ernest Sayon, a 23-year-old Staten Island man who died with a head injury after a struggle with NYPD cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot different 20 years later,&quot; Sharpton said, drawing claps from outraged churchgoers. &quot;There is video this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton must address anger over Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
