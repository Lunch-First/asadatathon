<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE HEARTBREAKING details were all too vivid for Iris Baez: the cops, the outnumbered victim, the chokehold, the motionless body on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It brings up everything like it was yesterday,&quot; said Baez, whose son Anthony died on Dec. 22, 1994, when a game of street football escalated into tragedy outside her Bronx home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It brings up so much of the wound and it opens up everything all over again. This heartbreak keeps happening.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baez spoke Saturday to the Daily News, just two days after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43. He died after a Staten Island cop wrapped a forearm around his throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They keep on doing the same thing as before,&quot; she lamented. &quot;Like they can do anything they want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Baez - an asthmatic, like Garner - was tossing a football with his brothers just three days before Christmas and the pigskin accidentally hit a nearby police car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baez, 29, stepped in when police grabbed his kid brother, and was mortally injured as cops tried to arrest him for disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orlando man was visiting for the holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family charged an enraged cop choked Anthony unconscious, and then left him lying in the street for 10 minutes before taking him to a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baez was dead on arrival. Garner, too, was declared dead at a nearby hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This young man didn't kill himself,&quot; Iris Baez said of Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They put an illegal chokehold on him. . . . He was clearly (saying), 'I can't breathe! I can't breathe!' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While five officers were involved in the Garner case, Anthony Baez was subdued by a half-dozen cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iris Baez read about the death in the Daily News, while both her son and daughter called after hearing what happened on the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she refused to watch the viral video obtained by The News that captured the arrest and its aftermath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I chose not to,&quot; she explained. &quot;I already imagine what that man went through from when my son went through it. I could just figure it out, the same way they took him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He took him down with an illegal chokehold. He couldn't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She later attended a Saturday morning Harlem rally where Garner's wife, mother, sister and daughter turned out for support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're here for them,&quot; Baez told The News before heading to the event. &quot;Hopefully, we can unite . . . and be there just to give support. I sympathize with you and I'm there for you because I've been there - and I know what it is and I know what it feels like.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The horrors of that December day are never far off for Iris Baez - she still lives in the same home on Anthony Baez Place, renamed to honor the memory of her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The holidays remain particularly hard almost two decades later, and Baez predicted Garner's family - particularly his six kids - will suffer the same pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At Christmas, my son used to love to dress up for the kids,&quot; she recounted. &quot;Now, when Christmas comes, we don't have a Santa Claus anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, little things,&quot; Baez continued. &quot;At dinner, he loved the drumsticks of the turkey. Those little things are here with me for life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was also upset that cops escalated what started as a simple arrest for allegedly selling untaxed single cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He didn't lunge at the police,&quot; she said. &quot;He didn't have a knife, he didn't have a gun. Why couldn't the police negotiate with him? . . . If he needed a ticket, then give him the damn ticket and leave him alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Francis Livoti did seven years in federal prison for violating Anthony's civil rights after a state trial ended in his acquittal for criminally negligent homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iris Baez hopes the officers involved in Garner's death pull even stiffer sentences if they're charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have to bring someone to justice because they committed a crime,&quot; she said. &quot;I say the officer who choked him should get 25 to life. That's the minimum he should get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
