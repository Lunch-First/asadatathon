<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 400-POUND asthmatic Staten Island dad died Thursday after a cop put him in a chokehold and other officers appeared to slam his head against the sidewalk, video of the incident shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, repeatedly screamed after at least five NYPD officers took him down in front of a Tompkinsville beauty supply store when he balked at being handcuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments Garner, a married father of six children with two grandchildren, stopped struggling and appeared to be unconscious as police called paramedics to the scene. An angry crowd gathered, some recording with smartphones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I kissed my husband this morning, I never thought it would be for the last time,&quot; Garner's wife, Esaw, told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She got no details from police until after she had gone to the hospital to identify his body, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw him with his eyes wide open and I said, 'Babe, don't leave me. I need you.' But he was already gone,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A family friend searching for her in the hospital ran into detectives from the NYPD's Internal Affairs Division. The friend put them on the phone with her, the grieving widow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She spoke with a Detective Howard, who told her, &quot;I'm sorry for your loss,&quot; she said. He said his office was involved &quot;because there is wrongdoing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials said Garner had a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes. Cops said they observed him selling his wares Thursday on Bay St. and moved in for an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NYPD spokesman would only say the man &quot;was being placed in custody, went into cardiac arrest and died&quot; at Richmond University Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Esaw Garner and other family members said it was a trumped up claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're covering their asses, he was breaking up a fight. They harassed and harassed my husband until they killed him,&quot; she said. Garner's family said he didn't have any cigarettes on him or in his car at the time of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she pleaded with police at the hospital to tell her what happened, but they brushed her off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wouldn't tell me anything,&quot; she said.Officials confirmed that NYPD Internal Affairs officers launched an investigation Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records show Garner was due in court in October on three Staten Island cases, including charges of pot possession and possession or selling untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner said her husband was unable to work because he suffered from a host of ailments, including chronic asthma, diabetes and sleep apnea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, 65, added, &quot;I want justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Garner was not armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Staten Island resident was sitting in front of Bay Beauty on Bay St. and Victory Blvd. just before 5 p.m. when two plainclothes cops began questioning him about selling untaxed cigarettes, a video obtained by the Daily News shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't do s---!&quot; the 6-foot-4 Garner, wearing a sweaty T-shirt and khaki shorts, told the officers from the 120th Precinct when they approached him. &quot;I was just minding my own business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today!&quot; he yelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey Orta, 22, who shot the video, tried to intervene, telling the cops his friend had just broken up a fight between three men and had not been selling cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when backup uniformed officers arrived, the cops moved in to cuff Garner, the video shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't touch me, please,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Garner refused orders to put his hands behind his back, one of the plainclothes cops, wearing a green T-shirt with a yellow No. 99 on the back, got behind him and put him in a chokehold, the footage shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A struggle ensued as three uniformed officers joined in on the arrest, knocking Garner to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He screamed, &quot;I can't breathe!&quot; six times before he went silent and paramedics were called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They jumped him and they were choking him. He was foaming at the mouth,&quot; Orta told The News. &quot;And that's it, he was done. The cops were saying, 'No, he's OK, he's OK.' He wasn't OK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were choking him. He kept saying, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe! Get off of me, get off of me!' and I didn't hear any more talking after that,&quot; said witness Valencia Griffin, 50, of Staten Island. &quot;He died right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness, who would only give his first name, Douglas, said he'd known Garner for four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a very big man, very intimidating, but he's just a big teddy bear,&quot; said Douglas, 50. &quot;He's the nicest guy. I can't believe what I saw. That's no way to do an arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the video's end, the cop who had choke-held Garner can be seen staring at the camera that was videotaping him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This had nothing to do with the fight, this had something to do with something else,&quot; the cop said, and walked away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A law enforcement source said the incident was troubling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A guy is dead in our custody. That is always a potential problem,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
