, 43, was confronted last week by New York City police, who suspected he was selling loose, untaxed cigarettes in Staten Island. When the situation escalated, several officers pulled Garner down and appeared to push his head into the ground.
Video taken by a passerby and obtained by the New York Daily News reveals that Garner -- an asthmatic -- said several times, 'I can't breathe.'
Police said Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Garner in a chokehold, had been placed on desk duty.
On Saturday, Garner's wife, Esaw, burst into tears at a rally to commemorate her late husband.
"This is going to be a real test to see where policies are in the city now and whether the change that we feel occurred has occurred," Rev. Al Sharpton said at the rally.
The Staten Island District Attorney's office is investigating the incident. Mayor Bill de Blasio postponed a vacation in order to speak with community leaders.
