THE NEW NYPD inspector general has opened a review into cops' use of prohibited chokeholds over the past five years, sources tell the Daily News.
Amid the outrage over last week's death of 
 IG Philip Eure requested hundreds of NYPD and the Civilian Complaint Review Board files. The CCRB has received 1,022 complaints alleging chokeholds since 2009, of which only nine were deemed "substantiated." Of those, only one resulted in any significant punishment, despite the NYPD having barred chokeholds since 1993. The CCRB deemed 462 of the complaints worthy of full investigation; 206 were "unsubstantiated" but will be reviewed by Eure.
