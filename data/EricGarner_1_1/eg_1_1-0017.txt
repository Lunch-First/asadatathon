A STATEN ISLAND man who died after an officer put him in a chokehold may have survived if he was given proper medical attention, said famed pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht.
Wecht, who has been a consultant in several high-profile cases including JonBenet Ramsey and Anna Nicole Smith, said 
 should have been immediately placed upright. "You want to position him in such a way to facilitate breathing," he said.
Garner's death was likely caused by a dangerous combination of a chokehold and being pinned down, Wecht said.
A preliminary autopsy showed no signs of asphyxiation or a crushed windpipe.
