The New York City medical examiner's office is trying to determine what caused the death of a man who appeared to be held in a chokehold as police attempted to arrest him.
A video showed an officer wrapping his arm around 
 neck as he was taken to the ground, arrested for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, and Mr Garner shouting: "I can't breathe!" Four emergency workers at the Staten Island hospital that pronounced him dead were barred from answering calls. AP
