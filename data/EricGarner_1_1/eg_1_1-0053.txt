  Tearful family members, elected officials and perfect strangers alike packed the Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn Wednesday to pay their final respects to 
 who died after scuffling with cops last week.  
  "Oh my God! They took him. They took my baby!" said Garner's wife, Esaw, as she walked up the to casket. 
  The grieving widow arrived at the church at about 5 p.m., flanked by two of the couple's six children, both dressed in matching suits and supporting their distraught mother. 
  Garner's mother and sister arrived a short time later in a stretch limousine, also looking devastated. 
  "My father meant everything to me," his daughter said from the pulpit, noting that he will be absent at his granddaughter's birthday next week. 
  Hundreds of mourners made their way past Garner as he lay in an open, white casket, dressed in a white suit and a light-blue shirt and tie. 
  "He was a good person. He was no thug," said Nicholas Heyward, 57, who grew up with Garner when the two lived in the Gowanus Houses in Boerum Hill. "He didn't deserve this. 
  "When I realized it was him, I felt a lot of pain. I was angry, upset and disappointed with the actions of the police."
