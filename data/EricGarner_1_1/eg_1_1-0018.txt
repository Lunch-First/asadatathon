 isn't alone.
More than 1,000 city residents have accused the NYPD of putting them in chokeholds in the past five years, the Civilian Complaint Review Board said Saturday. 
The startling numbers were revealed as new CCRB Chair Richard Emery said the board plans to conduct a "comprehensive study" of chokehold complaints and find out why cops are apparently still using the forbidden practice.
The chokehold study will be an "agency priority," according to CCRB Executive Director Tracy Catapano-Fox.
As of July 1, the CCRB had received 58 chokehold complaints against the NYPD this year, but had only substantiated one of them.
Out of the 1,022 chokehold allegations reported between 2008 and 2013, only 462 of the complaints were investigated. Out of that number, just nine were substantiated, according to the CCRB.
