<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Office of the  Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, U.S Government has issued the following news release:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke released the following statement in support of a full investigation of the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a resident of Staten Island who died last week when he was placed in a chokehold during an arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chokehold, a hold derived from the martial arts and intended to prevent normal breathing, has been prohibited by New York Police Department regulations since 1993, though the Civilian Complaint Review Board has received several hundred complaints about chokeholds in recent years. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suffered from severe asthma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On behalf of the people of the Ninth District of New York and myself, I wish to express my most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; said Congresswoman Clarke. &quot;I am concerned that the practice and use of the 'choke hold,' essentially choking people as a means of executing an arrest has continued to occur, despite regulations that prohibit its use by the New York City Police Department. I urge Mayor Bill de Blasio and Commissioner William Bratton to pursue a full and thorough investigation into the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while in the custody of the NYPD, both to secure justice for the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and to prevent such incidents from ever occurring again in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
