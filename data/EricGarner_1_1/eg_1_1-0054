<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A top de Blasio administration lawyer infuriated cops by tweeting about how the city failed NYPD &quot;chokehold&quot; victim </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - even as the investigation into his death remains open.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;RIP </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; wrote Ian Bassin, a deputy counsel who earns $140,000 a year. &quot;You deserved so much more from our City. We will and we must do better.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The premature July 19 posting (above) on Bassin's personal Twitter page enraged cops, who are under fire over the death even before an official autopsy report. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;That is crazy. This administration is filled with a bunch of liberal loonies,&quot; said a police source. &quot;I don't understand how someone who represents the mayor could go public with a statement like that without the autopsy report.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tweet came just two days before Mayor de Blasio stressed the need to let the investigation take its course before rushing to judgment. &quot;All sides need to be heard and all evidence looked at,&quot; he said Monday in Italy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, City Hall responded to questions about the tweet by saying, &quot;The mayor and police commissioner have made the administration's position on this tragic incident clear.&quot; Bassin declined to discuss the tweet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner, a 350-pound asthmatic diabetic, died struggling with police on July 17 on Staten Island when they tried to arrest him for peddling &quot;loosie&quot; cigarettes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He had more than 30 prior arrests, including for assault, and argued with cops during the cigarette incident, repeatedly resisting their efforts to cuff him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officer Daniel Pantaleo placed Garner, 43, in an apparent chokehold before he and fellow cop Justin Damico dragged him to the ground. Garner went into cardiac arrest and died on the way to a hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An initial police report noted that two supervising sergeants failed to tell Internal Affairs about the chokehold, but sources said the sergeants were unaware of the chokehold because they got to the scene after Garner was already on the ground, said a high-ranking police source. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sgts. Kizzy Adonis and Dhanan Saminath were never informed by the officers about how they took down Garner, who was still breathing but unconscious, the source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Internal Affairs detectives are still trying to determine whether Pantaleo applied a forbidden chokehold or if it was a &quot;submission&quot; hold, which may fall within departmental guidelines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Authorities are also still awaiting the final results of Garner's autopsy, which could take up to two weeks while the medical examiner performs toxicology tests.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, Internal Affairs is investigating another apparent police chokehold, caught on video in a Harlem subway station. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cops saw Ronald Johns, 23, go through a service-entrance gate at the 125th Street/Lexington Avenue station at about 5 p.m. on July 14, and struggled to arrest him when he refused to show ID, officials said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A video shows an officer punching him in the face and &shy;using either a headlock or chokehold to get him under control.  </SPAN></P>
