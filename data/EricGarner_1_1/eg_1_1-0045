<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 350-POUND Staten Island man died Thursday after a cop put him in a chokehold and other officers appeared to slam his head against the sidewalk, video of the incident shows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; the man repeatedly pleaded after at least four NYPD officers took him down in front of a Tompkinsville beauty supply store and attempted to cuff him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments, the suspect ceased struggling and appeared to be unconscious as police called paramedics and an angry crowd gathered, some recording the scene with smartphones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the dead man, whose name was not released, has a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes. They did not immediately say why officers were at the scene when he became the subject of an arrest. An NYPD spokesman said the man &quot;was being placed in custody, went into cardiac arrest and died&quot; at Richmond University Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was sitting in front of Bay Beauty on Bay St. and Victory Blvd. just before 5 p.m. when two plainclothes cops began questioning him about selling untaxed cigarettes, a video obtained by the Daily News shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't do s---!&quot; the 6-foot-6 man, wearing a sweaty T-shirt and khaki shorts, tells the officers from the 121st Precinct when they approached him. &quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey Orta, 22, who shot the video, tried to intervene, telling the officers his friend had just broken up a fight.</SPAN></P>
