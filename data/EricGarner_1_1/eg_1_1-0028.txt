THE NEIGHBORHOOD near the Staten Island Ferry terminal gets a steady flow of NYPD traffic and arrests - many for quality-of-life offenses. 
Triangular-shaped Tompkinsville Park (inset) and its surrounding streets are the subject of "numerous complaints" from local businesses and residents, says Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.
This year, the NYPD reported 98 arrests for various offenses, 100 summonses issued mostly for quality-of-life violations and 646 calls to 911 "within the immediate area of that very small park," Bratton said.
Quality-of-life infractions include loitering, having an open container of alcohol and public urination.
Overall in Staten Island's 120th Precinct, crime was down 3% this year through July 13, according to NYPD statistics.
William Galloway, 55, a retired sales manager, gave the NYPD a qualified thumbs-up in policing the neighborhood.
"The cops are doing a pretty good job in general," said the longtime Staten Island resident.
But Galloway felt the police were overly aggressive: "They don't know how to back off. All they know how to do is use force."
 43, died after being placed in a chokehold Thursday outside a beauty parlor near the park. Cops accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes, better known as "loosies."
"I think cops in general don't have enough training in dealing with sensitivity," said Rogelio Ramos, 54, of West Brighton. "I don't know what can be done about that."
