<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 400-POUND asthmatic Staten Island dad died Thursday after a cop put him in a chokehold and other officers appeared to slam his head against the sidewalk, video of the incident shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't breathe! I can't breathe!&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, repeatedly screamed after at least five NYPD officers took him down in front of a Tompkinsville beauty supply store when he resisted being handcuffed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within moments Garner, a married father of six children with two grandchildren, ceased struggling and appeared to become unconscious as police called paramedics to the scene. An angry crowd gathered, some recording with smartphones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I kissed my husband this morning, I never thought it would be for the last time,&quot; Garner's wife, Esaw, told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a history of arrests for selling untaxed cigarettes. They did not immediately say why officers were at the scene when he drew their attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NYPD spokesman would only say the man &quot;was being placed in custody, went into cardiac arrest and died&quot; at Richmond University Medical Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner said that when she arrived at the hospital her husband was already dead. She said she pleaded with police to tell her what happened, but they brushed her off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wouldn't tell me anything,&quot; she said. &quot;The Internal Affairs office called me to say they were taking over the case because there was wrongdoing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials confirmed that NYPD Internal Affairs officers launched an investigation Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esaw Garner said her husband was unable to work because he suffered from a host of ailments, including chronic asthma, diabetes and sleep apnea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was out there hanging out. He sold cigarettes, but he was a good man,&quot; the widow said. &quot;He never hurt a soul. He was the sweetest, kindest person in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, 65, added, &quot;I want justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Staten Island resident was sitting in front of Bay Beauty on Bay St. and Victory Blvd. just before 5 p.m. when two plainclothes cops began questioning him about selling untaxed cigarettes, a video obtained by the Daily News shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't do s---!&quot; the 6-foot-4 Garner, wearing a sweaty T-shirt and khaki shorts, told the officers from the 121st Precinct when they approached him. &quot;I was just minding my own business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today!&quot; he yelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey Orta, 22, who shot the video, tried to intervene, telling the officers his friend had just broken up a fight between three men and had not been selling cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when backup uniformed officers arrived, the cops moved in to cuff Garner, the video shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't touch me, please,&quot; said Garner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Garner refused orders to put his hands behind his back, one of the plainclothes cops, wearing a green Oakland A's T-shirt with No. 99 on the back, got behind him and put him in a chokehold, the footage shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A struggle ensued as three uniformed officers joined in on the arrest, knocking the man to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He screamed, &quot;I can't breathe!&quot; six times before he went silent and paramedics were called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They jumped him and they were choking him. He was foaming at the mouth,&quot; Orta told The News. &quot;And that's it, he was done. The cops were saying, 'No, he's OK, he's OK.&quot; He wasn't OK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some witnesses said officers used a stun gun on Garner, but the video did not show that and a police spokesman said he was unaware such a weapon was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were choking him. He kept saying, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe! Get off of me, get off of me!' and I didn't hear any more talking after that,&quot; said witness Valencia Griffin, 50, of Staten Island. &quot;He died right there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said Garner had just broken up a fight before cops began questioning him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was trying to stop a fight,&quot; Griffin said. &quot;They didn't have to choke him like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness, who would only give his first name, Douglas, said he's known Garner for four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a very big man, very intimidating, but he's just a big teddy bear,&quot; said Douglas, 50. &quot;He's the nicest guy. I can't believe what I saw. That's no way to do an arrest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Thomas, 49, of Brooklyn said he was arrested Saturday in the same neighborhood and beaten with a baton - for playing chess in a nearby park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cops pulled up. They said we weren't allowed to play chess,&quot; Thomas said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cellphone video obtained by The News shows a group of uniformed cops on top of Thomas, struggling to handcuff him - one beating him in the legs with a baton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear why Thomas was arrested, but he said he was released soon after being taken to the 121st Precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video does not show what preceded the arrest. But it does show an angry mob crowding around and cursing at cops, who ordered people to stand back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They beat me with a baton. I just laid there while they beat me,&quot; said Thomas, still sporting welts on his legs. &quot;What could I do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
