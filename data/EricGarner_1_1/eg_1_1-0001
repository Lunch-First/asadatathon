<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NYPD COP who put </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a chokehold was the subject of a Civilian Complaint Review Board probe on allegations he strip-searched two men in public and slapped their genitals, documents obtained by the Daily News show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darren Collins, 46, and Tommy Rice, 43, filed papers against Officer Daniel Pantaleo with the CCRB in 2012, claiming he &quot;slapped&quot; and &quot;tapped&quot; their testicles in broad daylight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo and three other plainclothes cops pulled over their Nissan Maxima about 10:50 a.m. on March 22, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops claimed to have witnessed a hand-to-hand drug deal involving the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they got out of the vehicle, the men told the review board, &quot;PO Pantaleo then removed Mr. Rice's belt, causing Mr. Rice's pants to sag down to the middle of his thigh. ... PO Pantaleo pulled Mr. Rice's pants down to his knees and then pulled his boxer shorts down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo then slapped Rice's private parts, the documents allege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pantaleo stated that he was attempting to shake out any contraband Mr. Rice might be hiding,&quot; the documents allege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins provided CCRB investigators with a similar account of the strip search. No drugs were found on either Collins or Rice, but a third person in the car was in possession of heroin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo denied the allegations.The men's claim was deemed unsubstantiated - it could not be proved or disproved - because it was the word of Collins and Rice against cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal charges against Rice and Collins were dismissed and they settled a federal lawsuit for $15,000 each this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCRB substantiated 23 complaints against cops in Pantaleo's 120th Precinct between 2009 and 2013 - the second-highest number citywide.</SPAN></P>
