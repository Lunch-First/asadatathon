A New York City police officer involved in the arrest of a man who died in custody after being placed in an apparent chokehold has been stripped of his gun and badge, police said. Officer Daniel Pantaleo and an unnamed officer were taken off the street after the death of 43-year-old 
 on Staten Island. It follows a number of legal challenges to the NYPD over its use of the stop and frisk tactic.
