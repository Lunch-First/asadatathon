<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To go, or not to go? If so, when?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A fly on the wall would have heard a frantic debate among Mayor de Blasio's inner circle about his planned trip to Italy. The decision to put it off for a day reflected a belated, if still incomplete, grasp of the complexities, including the optics.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To wit, it wouldn't look good for a progressive mayor to be pictured on a European vacation while the city boiled over.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The death of a Staten Island man in police custody sparked the delay, but any number of events could have qualified. While there is never a perfect time for a mayor to go away for 10 days, some are decidedly better than others. Six months into the job, during a summer shooting surge, is one of the worst.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police case makes the point. Two of the cops who arrested </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who is black, and put him in a chokehold were put on desk duty while the DA and the NYPD investigate. The incident was captured on video by a witness, and the mayor rightly called Garner's death a &quot;tragedy.&quot; Although he and Police Commissioner William Bratton suggested the cops were wrong, they wisely stopped short of declaring them guilty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cops, like everybody else in America, are presumed innocent, as former Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Mike Bloomberg frequently reminded New Yorkers. It's more than a legal point. Cops make split-second decisions of life and death, and too much second-guessing can make them timid.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, de Blasio ran on an anti-police agenda, and that raises another question about the vacation: If the Garner case, or one like it, happened while he was away, would he rush home to deal with it?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The correct answer is yes, which is why he shouldn't have gone.  </SPAN></P>
