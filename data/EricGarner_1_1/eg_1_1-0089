<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cop whose chokehold knocked out a Staten Island dad - and may have directly caused his fatal heart attack - is being targeted in online death threats and a Facebook page called &quot;Officer Daniel Pantaleo - Wanted Dead or Alive.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We should find him and choke him out show that coward piece of sh-t how Big E [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] felt when he did it to him,&quot; reads one threat from a guy identified as Gary Firefighter Battista. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another seething poster, identified as Maria Dubrito, wrote, &quot;You are a killer who should be put to sleep.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police cars continued to sit just outside Pantaleo's Eltingville home Monday as a work crew installed security cameras intended to dissuade or catch would-be vigilantes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pantaleo and fellow Officer Justin Damico were attempting to place Garner under arrest for allegedly selling a tax-free &quot;loosie&quot; cigarette for 50 cents Thursday before the 350-pound diabetic began to resist.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's when Pantaleo was caught on camera putting Garner in a chokehold - a move prohibited by the NYPD - and dragging him to the ground, causing him to lose consciousness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Garner died on the way to the hospital after allegedly neither police nor EMTs gave him any medical assistance, instead letting him lie unresponsive on the pavement for more than five minutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pantaleo's supervisors have insisted to NYPD Internal Affairs that Garner did not appear to be suffering cardiac arrest or in any other great distress as he was being subdued, according to a law-enforcement source familiar with the IA interview. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Meanwhile, a law-enforcement source with knowledge of the case said Pantaleo could be charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But this would be contingent upon the [medical examiner's] final report,&quot; the source continued.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;That's going to be the main factor - if the ME says that the cop's chokehold exacerbated the man's pre-existing health conditions,&quot; which include obesity and asthma.  </SPAN></P>
