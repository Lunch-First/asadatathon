<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NEIGHBORHOOD near the Staten Island Ferry terminal gets a steady flow of NYPD traffic and arrests - many for quality-of-life offenses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Triangular-shaped Tompkinsville Park (inset) and its surrounding streets are the subject of &quot;numerous complaints&quot; from local businesses and residents, says Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the NYPD reported 98 arrests for various offenses, 100 summonses issued mostly for quality-of-life violations and 646 calls to 911 &quot;within the immediate area of that very small park,&quot; Bratton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quality-of-life infractions include loitering, having an open container of alcohol and public urination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall in Staten Island's 120th Precinct, crime was down 3% this year through July 13, according to NYPD statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Galloway, 55, a retired sales manager, gave the NYPD a qualified thumbs-up in policing the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cops are doing a pretty good job in general,&quot; said the longtime Staten Island resident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Galloway felt the police were overly aggressive: &quot;They don't know how to back off. All they know how to do is use force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 43, died after being placed in a chokehold Thursday outside a beauty parlor near the park. Cops accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes, better known as &quot;loosies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think cops in general don't have enough training in dealing with sensitivity,&quot; said Rogelio Ramos, 54, of West Brighton. &quot;I don't know what can be done about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
