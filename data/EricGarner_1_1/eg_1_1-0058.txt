All 35,000 members of the New York Police Department are to be retrained after a man died when he was placed in an illegal choke-hold by an officer who suspected that he was selling cigarettes on the street. 
The death of 
, 43, a 6ft 3in married father of six known as Big E and Teddy Bear, was captured on video last Friday by a passer-by, causing public outrage.
The incident has inflamed debate over a police strategy that aims to reduce serious crimes in New York by rigorously stamping on offenders who commit petty ones - the "broken windows" method of policing.
That an initial police report appeared to try to hush-up the incident has fuelled the anger.
Dealing with the incident will be a challenge to Bill de Blasio, New York's mayor, who assumed office in January after running on promises to improve relations between police and minority communities.
Police suspected that Garner, who was African American, was selling untaxed cigarettes - a charge that he had faced numerous times before.
The video shows an officer putting his arm around Garner's neck, placing him in a choke-hold, a move banned by the NYPD since 1994.
Garner is heard saying "I can't breathe" eight times, as police force his head to the pavement. Four medics who are seen arriving on the scene appear to do little to try to revive him, and their conduct is being investigated.
Victor A Brown, a local church leader, told The New York Times: "The police get enough training; a mind-set is the issue. Enough is enough. Stop killing our people."
Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who used the choke-hold, has been ordered to turn in his badge and gun and placed on desk duty.
He has been sued twice for civil rights infractions in the past two years.
