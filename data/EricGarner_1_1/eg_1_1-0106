<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - In a Sunday appeal from the pulpit, the Rev. Al Sharpton demanded justice for a man he said was choked to death by New York City police but added that citizens who attack police officers also should be held accountable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activist minister and television host spoke at Manhattan's Riverside Church three days after the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a Staten Island street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garner was &quot;choked by New York City policemen,&quot; the Harlem preacher told the congregation. &quot;What bothers me is that the nation watches a man say 'I can't breathe' and the choking continues, and police surround him and none of them even say, 'Wait a minute, stop! He can't breathe!' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When does your sense of humanity kick in?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY (AP) - A new documentary examines what led to the 2009 arrests on terrorism charges of four Hudson Valley men.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumer to lower cost of pet prescriptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY (AP) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer says pet owners could save millions of dollars on prescriptions for their animals if they could buy the drugs at ordinary pharmacies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Democrat says Sunday that he's working with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut on legislation that would require veterinarians to write prescriptions to allow owners to buy the medication at a pharmacy or online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumer says many owners pay too much for pet medications because veterinarians don't provide prescriptions unless asked and sell the drugs themselves at much higher prices than pharmacies. He says pet owners in the U.S. spend $10 billion each year on pet medications and other health-related products.</SPAN></P>
