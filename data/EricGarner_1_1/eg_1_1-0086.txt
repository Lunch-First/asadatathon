  POLICE Commissioner Bill Bratton missed a cocktail party held in honor of him and wife Rikki Klieman at Cape Cod's prestigious Willowbend Country Club on Friday night, hosted by Willowbend owner David Southworth and Bratton's friend, p.r. guru George Regan. The NYPD chief skipped the event to stay in the city to deal with an investigation after Staten Island dad

Klieman mingled without her husband at the mixer, and the next day emceed the Cape Cod Healthcare's Summer Charity Gala to benefit heart and vascular services.
