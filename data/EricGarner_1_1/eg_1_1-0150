<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A religious organization would be barred from making hiring decisions based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Exceptions would be allowed for ministers, and groups would be allowed to favor individuals of a particular religion when hiring. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EPA to block copper mine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - U.S. environmental regulators laid out proposed protections for Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed on Friday that would effectively block the development of the Pebble deposit, which could be one of the world's largest copper mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 214-page document posted to its website, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to restrict the use of certain waters in the region for disposal of dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the latest step by the EPA to use a rare process under the Clean Water Act to try to stop work on the proposed copper-gold mine, which it says would threaten the region's valuable salmon fisheries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project owner Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, meanwhile, has sued the EPA for trying to derail development before the company has even applied for its permit or environmental assessment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OKLAHOMA CITY - A federal appeals court ruling Friday that Oklahoma's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional spurred celebration among gay rights activists but sparked sharp anger among Republican leaders in a conservative state that prides itself on being the buckle of the nation's Bible Belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upholding a federal judge's ruling is the latest in a decade-long legal battle. That fight was launched by two couples - Sharon Baldwin and Mary Bishop, and Gay Phillips and Susan Barton - shortly after 76 percent of Oklahoma voters backed the ban in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court put its 2-1 ruling on hold pending an appeal, meaning same-sex couples won't be allowed to marry in Oklahoma for now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - The New York Police Department has launched an internal investigation into the death of a 43-year-old man whose final moments were captured in a video in which he can be heard gasping &quot;I can't breathe&quot; over and over again after an officer is seen placing him in a chokehold, officials said.</SPAN></P>
