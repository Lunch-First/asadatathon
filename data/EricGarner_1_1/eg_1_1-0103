<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 21--Complaints about chokeholds reviewed internally by the NYPD resulted mainly in a slap on the wrist, according to data compiled by the Civilian Complaint Review Board. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 10 substantiated incidents involving chokeholds from 2009 to 2014, three resulted in the officer being sentenced to retraining and one resulted in a loss of at least 10 vacation days, according to the CCRB data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD declined to internally try two of the cases. And three cases are still pending. In the last case, the officer either resigned retired before a ruling was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 43, died while in police custody in Staten Island after being arrested and allegedly placed in a chokehold by Officer Daniel Pantaleo. Garner was being arrested for allegedly selling individual, untaxed cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pantaleo, an eight-year veteran of the NYPD, had his badge and gun taken away and was placed on modified duty, police said. A second, unidentified officer who was present during the incident, was placed on desk duty and four EMS workers who responded to the incident were placed on modified duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Garner's death, CCRB said they will review the more than 1,000 chokehold allegations they received from 2009 to 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The circumstances surround the 10 substantiated cases were unclear. They mostly took place in Brooklyn and the Bronx and did not include any cases from Staten Island precincts, where Garner died.</SPAN></P>
