A New York City man died during an arrest - captured on amateur video - during which a police officer placed him in what appeared be a choke hold as several others brought him to the ground and struggled to place him in handcuffs. Internal affairs investigators and prosecutors opened inquiries into 
 Thursday evening death outside a beauty salon in Staten Island. Garner, 43, had a heart attack as he struggled with officers trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes, police said. Partial video shows an officer placing what appears to be a choke hold on the 6-foot-3, 350-pound Garner, who can be heard complaining that he can't breathe. The video shows the officer who apparently choked Garner using his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk.
