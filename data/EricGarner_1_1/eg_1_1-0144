<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eric Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a New York man allegedly selling illegal &quot;loosies&quot; - single cigarettes - outside a Staten Island store, died Thursday after police used an unauthorized street fighting move known as a &quot;chokehold&quot; to subdue the 350-pound man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stark contrast between a minor street crime - one which Mr. Garner had been arrested for many times - and the tragic consequence of leaving a widow with six kids has forced New Yorkers to revisit some of the darker chapters for the city's elite but oft-chastised police force, and to rehash what many thought were long-settled issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Police commissioner William Bratton, chokeholds used by at least two police officers to subdue Garner came after the man pleaded with a gaggle of officers to leave him alone as he was &quot;minding his own business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time you see me, you want to mess with me,&quot; Garner can be heard saying. &quot;I'm tired of it. It stops today. I'm minding my business please just leave me alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encounter escalated to the point of a faceoff, whereupon one officer wraps his arm around his neck even as Garner, now on the ground, pleads that he can't breathe. A few minutes later Garner loses consciousness as the officer mashed his face into the sidewalk - the victim of a fatal heart attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough of the ordeal was captured by an amateur photographer's camera for Mayor Bill de Blasio to rule the death &quot;a terrible tragedy.&quot; A bigger question remained: Why did two veteran officers feel free to employ a tactic banned in 1993, especially given that a civil conversation may have deescalated the ordeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was all the way back in 1983 when the department, following several asphyxiation deaths, banned the practice except in cases of imminent danger to the police officer. In 1994, a year after the city banned the tactic altogether, NYPD Officer Francis Livoti killed Bronx resident Anthony Baez with a chokehold after Mr. Livoti's cruiser was hit by a football being thrown around by friends. Livoti was found not guilty of negligent homicide, but later served seven years in prison after a federal court found he violated Baez' civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chokeholds are prohibited by the New York City Police Department and most departments,&quot; Commissioner Bratton said at a news conference Friday. Mr. Bratton also noted that &quot;Mr. Garner repeatedly complained of difficulty breathing as the officers wrestled him to the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policing experts say that it's fine to ask officers to be more careful with aggressive subjects, but that once an incident escalates into a street fight that all bets are essentially off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hard truth about street policing is there's a tremendous amount of improvisation,&quot; Eugene O'Donnell, a former cop and now a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice told the New York Daily News.&nbsp; &quot;[Officers] get some very generalized guidance, typically, which is not very valuable once you have to make the decision to use force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that at least two officers utilized it has been enough to spark an inquest and investigation into Garner's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton held a vigil for Garner amid calls for justice as the widow, Esaw Garner, clung to Sharpton in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Police Department and mayors have fought for controversial tactics that focus on low-level crimes, arguing tactics like the controversial &quot;stop-and-frisks&quot; are not only constitutional but effective in curbing local crime rates. Some courts have disagreed with at least the first notion, forcing the city to largely abandon the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other major US police departments, including in Atlanta, are putting less emphasis on penny-ante arrests because of the wedge they tend to drive between tougher neighborhoods and the police officers that serve them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
