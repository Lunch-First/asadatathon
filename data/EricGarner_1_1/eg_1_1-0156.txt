The Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers to avoid pure powdered caffeine sold on the Internet after the death of an Ohio teen.
A teaspoon of the powder could be lethal - it is equivalent to 25 cups of coffee. Eighteen-year-old Logan Stiner of LaGrange, Ohio, died May 27 after consuming it. 
The FDA said it is investigating caffeine powder and will "consider taking regulatory action."
Teenagers and young adults may be particularly drawn to the powder, which is a stimulant. It is marketed as a dietary supplement and is unregulated.

The University of Connecticut will pay $1.3 million to settle a lawsuit by five women who alleged the school did not take seriously their claims of sexual assaults on campus. The bulk of the settlement, $900,000, will go to Silvana Moccia, a former UConn ice-hockey player who said she was kicked off the team after reporting she had been raped by a male hockey player in August 2011.
The other four women will receive payments ranging from $25,000 to $125,000. 
University officials adamantly denied that they have been indifferent to reports of assaults and did not admit any wrongdoing.
