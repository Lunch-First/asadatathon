</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oscar Grant did not deserve to die. This is the central message of &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; a film dramatizing the real-life case of the young unarmed black man shot in the back by a white police officer in 2009. It's a common message, often heard in film and life in general. But the way writer-director Ryan Coogler delivers this message is extraordinary. As portrayed by Michael B. Jordan (beware of plot spoilers ahead) Grant is a great father - and a convicted felon. He loves his girlfriend - and he cheats on her. He wants to hold down a legal job - and he can't make it to work on time. He's a drug dealer who takes time to make his bed in the morning, a hardened convict and a mama's boy - a thuggish angel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the credits roll, Oscar Grant has become one of the rarest artifacts in American culture: a three-dimensional portrait of a young black male - a human being. Rendered Which raises the question: If Grant was a real person, what about all these other young black males rendered as cardboard cutouts by our merciless culture? What other humanity are we missing? &quot;Everyone either made Oscar out to be a saint, depending on whatever their political agenda was, and on the other side they made him out to be this villain,&quot; Coogler said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything he had ever done wrong in his life was magnified,&quot; Coogler said. &quot;He was just a criminal, a thug, a drug dealer, and he deserved what he got. You live that type of lifestyle, you get what you deserve. His humanity was lost.&quot; Grant was 22 years old in the early hours of New Year's Day, returning home to Oakland, California, with his girl and other friends. In the film, a fight starts on the train when Grant encounters an enemy from prison. Police detained Grant and his friends on the platform of the Fruitvale station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are abusive; Grant and friends respond with belligerence. Grant is being held face down on the platform, unarmed and struggling, when the officer shoots him once in the back. Numerous bystanders captured the scene on video. That's the first scene of the film, using real video shot by bystanders. Then it jumps backwards one day to fill in the blanks of an average brother, to illustrate the mundane moments with family, friends and strangers that constitute real life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Grant's death hit the news, what much of the public saw was a convicted drug dealer who had been released from prison three months before his death. They saw a troublemaker who police said was resisting arrest. They didn't see everything else that's in &quot;Fruitvale Station.&quot; &quot;If there's one thing missing in our country, it's an acknowledgment of the broad humanity of black folks,&quot; Ta-Nehisi Coates recently wrote on his blog at TheAtlantic.com. &quot;Racism - and anti-black racism in particular - is the belief that there's something wrong with black people.&quot; The remedy: &quot;Close the gap between what they see and who we really are,&quot; Coates wrote. (AP) Asked what it felt like to close that gap, the actor Jordan said, &quot;It felt real. It felt like I was telling a story for young African-American males who are stereotyped and judged before people get a chance to know them.&quot; &quot;We wanted to let people know who this guy was through the people who knew him the best,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;Show the good, bad and the ugly. Flaws and all.&quot; &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; is not unprecedented. It's part of a recent wave of independent black films that are putting authentic black characters on more screens than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can make a difference in how black men are perceived in the real world, said black filmmaker Ava DuVernay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A more complex, truer, authentic, comprehensive, non-caricature view of any person, of any kind of person, helps us all to understand each other a little bit more,&quot; DuVernay said. &quot;When you're only getting one dimension, unfortunately it does do its work, and that is mostly negative.&quot; We have seen the complex depths of black manhood before, from actors such as Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington, or television's &quot;The Wire,&quot; or Kanye West's music catalog. Even major studios are presenting substantial black male roles this year with &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; and &quot;Lee Daniels' The Butler.&quot; (Although the roles are still, well, a slave and a butler.) Perhaps it's serendipity, then, that gives &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; so much power: The film started trickling into theaters as the verdict was delivered in the Trayvon Martin case in Florida.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Before I can move on, I'd like to know more about The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's comment that both Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman had previous brushes with the law. Some emails circulating on the Internet say that Martin wasn't the innocent child his lawyers portrayed. I don't believe everything on the Internet but would like the subject clarified. --- Theda Davis, Lilburn </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Martin was serving a suspension from school --- his third --- when he was shot while visiting his father's girlfriend's condo in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012. He had been caught with an &quot;empty plastic bag with traces of marijuana in it,&quot; according to a police report obtained by the Miami Herald. His first suspension stemmed from tardiness and truancy, and his second occurred in October 2011, when he was seen on a school surveillance camera defacing lockers with a marker. A school police investigator searched Martin's book bag and found 12 pieces of jewelry, a watch and a &quot;burglary tool,&quot; according to a police report. Martin said the jewelry belonged to a friend and he wasn't disciplined for having the jewelry, which was impounded by police for further investigation. Zimmerman was charged with resisting arrest in July 2005 after shoving an undercover agent, but he avoided jail by undergoing a pretrial diversion program. One month later, his then-fiancee filed a civil motion for a restraining order that included allegations of domestic violence. Their relationship ended. In September 2011, Zimmerman was selected to head the neighborhood watch after a series of burglaries at the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a condo complex in Sanford.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor of THE EAGLE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama recently gave an impassioned speech in response to the verdict of not guilty in the trial of racial profiler and likely murderer George Zimmerman. The president asserted that in his past, he was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, profiled and misunderstood by the dominant white culture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, on the other hand, it would be difficult to see the president as anything like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, and, in fact, his behavior in office suggests he likely relates better to George Zimmerman these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Zimmerman and Obama profile with lethal consequences, Zimmerman in his killing of Martin in an attempt to be a neighborhood watchman, and Obama in the child murder he perpetuates with his use of drone warfare overseas. Both see their victims as unfortunate but necessary collateral damage to keep their communities safe, both men invoke their personal and our national fear of the &quot;other&quot; to legitimatize their criminal and murderous activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it is George Zimmerman waddling swiftly at the heels of a teenager he mistrusts due to his skin color or Obama signing off on artificial intelligence war machines slaughtering innocents abroad, the result is the same. Both men are allowing their prejudice and cowardice to define their actions which have fatal consequences to innocent children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama may have been Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but he is George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before sex, ask for ID</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a man and a woman engage in sexual conduct, assuming it is consentual, no laws have been broken. Are men required to ask for proof of age before we engage in sex? The incident in Wilmington indicates we do so. A young lady, in this case a kid, engages in sexual conduct with three men, even though she knew she is not of age, and shouldn't have been there in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They, on the other hand are to blame. They engaged with her, unknown to them of her true age. Had they known her age, would they have still had sex with her? Because there was alcohol involved, maybe. I see young girls everyday that I assume are 18, but are only 12. They mature much faster than they did when I was a young man. My advice to all young men is, before you engage in any contact with a female, check their ID. Sounds stupid, but you are only protecting yourself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And parents of young girls, you should be more involved in your daughters' lives, and they maybe wouldn't be out looking for sex. Education starts in the home. So to end my opinion, I feel as though the young girl involved should be charged with coercion for her role into the assault. After all, she was a willing participant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The safer way<BR>to store nuclear waste</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 30, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which Sen. Bernard Sanders is a member, will hold a hearing on the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2013. This legislation would establish interim waste storage sites for high-level nuclear waste and a new oversight agency to manage the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, 75 percent of the radioactive spent fuel is stored on site at nuclear reactors in overcrowded cooling pools. Given it will take years to build interim sites, this hearing is an opportunity for Sen. Sanders to call for thinning these pools by transferring spent fuel that has cooled sufficiently to cement and steel dry casks, which are safer and more secure. Spent fuel pools require electricity to circulate water, making them vulnerable during outages. Dry casks, conversely, are &quot;passively&quot; cooled by natural air flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear plant owners store as much as five times more nuclear waste in these pools than they were designed to contain. More spent fuel in the pools poses a greater risk to the surrounding community in the event of an accident that releases radioactivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent experts and labor, science and environmental organizations support transferring spent fuel to dry casks as quickly as possible to better protect the tens of millions of Americans who live within 50 miles of a nuclear reactor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dark side to wildlife education?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do wild animals have to die to support Vermont's wildlife educational programs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much money spent to kill wild animals already captured and put in pens i.e.. management units which are probably large and green giving a false impression of naturalness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the participants are fooled I'm sure, especially the doomed moose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power of the jury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's too bad that the juror in the Trayvon Martin case who thought that George Zimmerman got away with murder didn't know about the principle of jury nullification. New Hampshire acknowledged the right of juries &quot;to judge the application of the law in relationship to the facts in controversy&quot; by codifying it into law last year (HB 146). In a previous unsuccessful attempt to codify the principle into law, a great amount of legal precedent was cited for the proposed law, which indicates to me that codification wasn't and isn't necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People should know that the most powerful people in the courtroom are not the lawyers or the judge, but the members of the jury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The ethics council for lawyers in West Virginia would not know an ethics violation if it fell from the sky and hit them in the head.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan and Bush all went home on occasion for breaks from D.C. Obama doesn't have a home to go back to so he vacations someplace expensive and different trip after trip. Comparing Bush/Obama vacations is comparing apples to oranges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Have you heard much about the large clips of ammunition lately? Joe Manchin's faux stance for background checks is only to take the attention off the large clips, which is one of the NRA's main moneymakers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The Pentagon says we're at war with &quot;Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces,&quot; but the identity of the &quot;associated forces&quot; is classified.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Conservatives would have you believe that everything wrong with America is the fault of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, and that there was no president between their presidencies. And you know what? They are right. There was no president between Clinton and Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-To the reader who said President Obama had been on vacation a total of 83 days. Seems you have your stats all wrong. Obama has been in office more than five years and has been on vacation or out to lunch or campaigning 100 percent of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I'm still an Obama supporter, but his commentary bemoaning us for locking our doors at the sight of an approaching stranger as proof we are racist was unfair. Please publish the ethnic composition of our prison population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - The mother of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin and a prominent black lawyers' organization are keeping up the pressure for repeal of &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton joined the call Monday with top officials of the National Bar Association, which is holding its annual convention in Miami Beach. Fulton says she believes neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman got away with murder when he shot Martin in Sanford last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder earlier this month. He claimed he was acting in self-defense when he shot Martin because the unarmed 17-year-old attacked him. Many critics have said they believe Zimmerman profiled Martin because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida lawmakers say it is unlikely the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law will be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal officials are reviewing whether to charge Zimmerman with violating Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bricks showered onto the small south Philadelphia street and nearly covered a car parked out front. The houses on either side of the destroyed home were partly standing but a Philadelphia police department spokeswoman said they were badly damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas and electrical utility crews were trying to determine what caused the collapse. Rescue crews were combing through the rubble to see if anyone else was trapped.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - Weeks before the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination this fall, ReelzChannel will take another look at the killing in a docudrama that suggests a Secret Service agent fired one of the bullets that felled Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;JFK: The Smoking Gun&quot; is based on the work of retired Australian police Detective Colin McLaren, who spent four years combing through evidence from Kennedy's death on Nov. 22, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-hour docudrama airs Nov. 3 in the U.S., Canada and Australia. It suggests that agent George Hickey fired one of the bullets that hit Kennedy. Hickey, who is now dead, was riding in the car behind Kennedy's limo that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program is ReelzChannel's second Kennedy-related offering. In 2011, the cable channel aired &quot;The Kennedys&quot; after History Channel dropped the miniseries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am deeply disturbed by those who proclaim &quot;justice was served&quot; in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be a crime, beyond any reasonable doubt, for a man to take a loaded gun, ignore instructions from an emergency dispatcher, stalk an innocent teenager and kill him after a confrontation that, regardless of who swung first or who swung at all, was the result of the killer's aggressive behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But under Florida's stand-your-ground law, &quot;justice was served.&quot; While Florida may be the worst state, it's not alone. Some 20 states have passed similar laws due to lobbying by the NRA and ALEC, and passed by tea party Republican legislatures. It is they who are guilty of murdering Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many more will die before these awful laws are taken off the books? In the meantime, the lessons are clear: If you are black and living in a stand-your-ground state, arm yourself and, when you feel threatened, shoot to kill. If you don't carry a gun, stay out of Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martinez</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Double jeopardy for Zimmerman?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was tried by a jury of his peers and found not guilty of all charges. That's good enough for me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, I believe this verdict doesn't fit the U.S. government's domestic or international Balkanization agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, President Barack Obama stated we should accept the jury's verdict. Then he reversed course and inserted himself into the fray, stating he could &quot;feel the pain&quot; as he could have been young Trayvon&nbsp;Martin early in life. Excuse me? Obama was raised in Hawaii by middle-class white grandparents. Why didn't the president choose to speak out on the huge problem of black-on-black crimes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next up comes Attorney General Eric Holder, of &quot;fast and furious&quot; fame, threatening to prosecute Zimmerman for violating Martin's civil rights -- effectively placing Zimmerman under double jeopardy -- and a review of state stand-your-ground laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my opinion, all this hype is nothing more than another attack on our Second Amendment right to self-defense against violent attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's reality: When guns are outlawed, only the government will have guns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strikes by public servants not OK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union boss Pete Castelli has threatened to call another BART strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He seems to have no concept (or doesn't care) that collective bargaining by public employee unions has different implications than collective bargaining by private employee unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nature of public services gives them a monopoly. A New York judge said, &quot;Nothing is more dangerous to public welfare than to admit that hired servants of the state can dictate conditions under which they will carry on essential services vital to the welfare, safety and security of the citizen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The words &quot;safety&quot; and &quot;security&quot; are words of special note that our legislators should take seriously. It may be time to pass a law disallowing strikes by public servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Franklin Roosevelt, who was a big friend of private sector unions, drew the line when it came to government workers. Anyone who participates in shutting down public transportation should be fired. I am sure some of the 2 million unemployed Californians would be glad to take the jobs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of El Cerrito is asking for suggestions for improvement to make the city safer and a more pleasant place in which to live. Good goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, however, most of what I've seen on the city's behalf are a number of twirly things hanging from poles along San Pablo Avenue and bicycle rings that no one seems to use along the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If El Cerrito is really interested in promoting safety, I can think of two important safety measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fix all the cracks and holes in the sidewalks, which cause falls resulting in injuries to walkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plant trees to provide not only shade but to help reduce carbon monoxide, which in turn improve air quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are basic improvements the city should be providing. Twirly things are nice but should come last in money spent. Safety and regular maintenance should come first in city budgets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where's the outrage for Antonio West?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read &quot;Obama gives voice to pain.&quot; He called on the nation to do some soul searching over the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. But not Antonio West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty-five years ago we didn't have the problems we have today. No one would think of shooting a child or anyone else. Death sentences were given and carried out. Parents could correct their children -- now the law steps in and tells the parent what they can and can't do. No wonder our jails are filled. And, kids and adults think they are above the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't see any outrage about the shooting of Antonio West in Brunswick, Ga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When two black youths, 17-year-old De'Marquis Elkins and another 14-year-old juvenile, demanded that Sherry West, his mother, give them her money, she said she didn't have any. The teen fired four shots: One at the ground, one at her head, grazing her left ear, one at her left leg above the knee. They then proceeded around to the stroller and shot baby Antonio in the face. He was just 13 months old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't read about the president making a statement about this shooting. The media didn't care enough to cover it. There was no one going to Brunswick, Ga., to demand justice for this child. No one is protesting in the streets about his death and destroying city buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My question is, what makes one child better than the other? Where is the equal justice? Perhaps it is one-sided or just color blindness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters showed biases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears to me the jurors in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case were not biased and that the outcome was not racially motivated. I wish the same could be said about the protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How interesting that they believe they have a better understanding of the facts and Florida law than the six jury members who decided the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While much of the nation's diverse population is working toward a color-blind society, those who disagree with the verdict seem to selectively pick and choose factors that support their biases and viewpoints. That's easy to do these days when the media do the same thing, and Internet chatter is based far more on emotion than on facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice based on equality, and discrimination based on racial preferences, are mutually exclusive. We can't have both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also can't have majority rule, which is the foundation of democracy, and federal investigations and rulings based on political pressure by special interests. Sadly, this nation is moving toward the latter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury ignored the evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think the jury understood the evidence that was presented to them. They were more focused on the stand-your-ground issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the advice of the 911 dispatcher, George Zimmerman left his vehicle and confronted Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman testified that his weapon was in his waistband at his back. It is doubtful he could have reached the weapon with Martin straddling him. I believe Zimmerman had the gun in his hand and Martin tried to protect himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some on the right are making Zimmerman out to be the victim; that he should get a medal and Martin got what he deserved. What sad excuses for humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While peaceful demonstrations are useful, in order to assure we have justice for all Americans, I urge all to register and vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acquittal was outrageous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is outrageous George Zimmerman was acquitted for killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone keeps talking about the stand-your-ground law as one reason Zimmerman is free today. What I fail to hear is that Martin also was standing his ground, which I guess doesn't matter according to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin is not here to defend himself. I bet if he were, the verdict would have been very different. No justice whatsoever in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe Zimmerman will definitely pay for his deeds by not being able to live a normal life. I hope it is miserable for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How very sad for Martin and his family. My heart and prayers go out to them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trial was a political stunt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter by a jury of six women (four of them mothers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This verdict was reached because the prosecution could not present any evidence that proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, based on the non-existent evidence, the charges shouldn't have been brought. The entire matter was a political stunt by the Florida State Attorney Angela Corey in her attempt to enhance her ambition to run for higher office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the liberal media sees this as an opportunity to stir up racism and curry favor with minorities. They mask the fact that Zimmerman is a minority by referring to him as a &quot;white&quot; Hispanic. Ridiculous? Of course. But since when has the liberal media been accused of fairness and accuracy when a crisis can be used to advance their cause of racial pandering?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing more deplorable in this matter is the fact that President Obama is trying to use the Zimmerman affair as a distraction from all the scandals that plague him and his administration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Letter writers offer distortion of Israel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent anti-Israel letters rewrite a fictional history to support their opinion of hate. The &quot;Jewish Voice for Peace&quot; -- a brilliantly deceptive name -- is one of the most vitriolic haters of Israel and Jews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jewish Kingdom of Judea had existed for more than 700 years by the time Imperial Rome came to destroy it in war -- documented in writing -- from 70-130 AD. To remove any Jewish association with the land, the Romans created a brand-new name for the area: Palestine -- whose etymological root means &quot;invader.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palestine Authority President Mahmoud Abbas repeatedly states that he will never recognize a Jewish State of Israel. Gaza, ruled by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group Hamas, asserts a no-compromise religious duty not just to destroy Israel but to murder every Jew on Earth. A &quot;one state&quot; solution is code for the destruction of Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Islamist future for women? Islamist Taliban shot 16-year-old Malala Yousafzai in the face in 2012. Her crime? Advocating the right of girls to go to school. In Israel, an Arab woman sits on the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replace labor and management</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greed that all sides of the BART union negotiations have exposed is sickening. We tax and ratepayers are not getting good value for our money. The negotiations are between fat cats and fat kittens. Nobody is looking out for the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to public service? We need a Truman Commission to look into the excesses granted throughout the BART system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pay about $11.50 a day to ride in noisy, crowded trains. Each station looks shabby. Signage is circa 1970. Toilets -- if available -- are penitentiary grade and fast-food clean. I hear that the major cost to the system is labor, but there is no visible station help in Fremont, just one poor soul in a bulletproof booth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The train drivers seem friendly, but their major task (as viewed by me) is announcing station stops. BART police and management are otherwise unknown to me, but I suspect they are well-compensated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm fed up. We collectively have paid for this system for decades only to watch it grow fat and shabby. Where is the taxpayer's advocate? Strike? Let's bring in scabs to take over labor and management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All chance meetings don't turn out badly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a sunny Sunday morning some years ago, driving on the Long Island Expressway, a tire blew up. I was able to coast to the next exit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a white woman and found myself in a deserted, rundown neighborhood with no phones in sight, and cell phones were not yet available. I had to change the tire myself, and started to jack up the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another car stopped behind mine. A young, tall black man came out and offered to change the tire. I was surprised and grateful. A job that would have taken me hours was completed in a short time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I offered him some money the young man declined, saying that he wished somebody would do the same for his mother and sister. He mentioned that he was on his way to pick them up for church. I told him the money could be spent for ice cream after the service. He smiled and accepted my small offering. The entire time we spent together I never felt threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reciprocal respect created a feeling of friendship.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fremont</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask why Martin threw first punch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do I think George Zimmerman should have been acquitted? Considering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin attacked Zimmerman, punching him in the face and knocking Zimmerman to the ground; considering that punch hit Zimmerman so hard that Martin broke Zimmerman's nose; considering that Martin was taller than Zimmerman and younger; considering that Martin told Zimmerman, as Martin bashed Zimmerman's head into the concrete, that Zimmerman was going to die -- considering all this, Zimmerman was put into a fight for his life and had to defend himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media kept saying Martin was unarmed. Martin had fists and a 17-year-old's energy. Fists can kill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question should have been, &quot;Why did Trayvon&nbsp;Martin throw that first punch?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will the real Bill Thompson please stand up? The mayoral candidate who in May saw an &quot;overreaction to stop and frisk&quot; now says the NYPD's strategy is driven by the same suspicion George Zimmerman harbored toward Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing before an African-American congregation Sunday, Thompson leveled a unwarranted, counterproductive accusation against the department that was all the more disturbing because of how it clashed with his past postures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lone black contender in the race, Thompson responded to the not guilty verdict rendered against Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who trailed the innocent, unarmed 17-year-old Martin and shot him to death during a struggle, by tweeting on July 13: &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed because he was black. There was no justice done today in Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, in an address at Brooklyn's Abundant Life Church, he made the leap from Zimmerman's motivations to the NYPD's program of stopping, questioning and sometimes frisking people suspected of criminality. Thompson said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, we have institutionalized Mr. Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to treat young black and Latino men with suspicion, to stop them and frisk them because of the color of their skin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that, in his view, NYPD officers had &quot;profiled as Trayvon was profiled&quot; large numbers of the minority group members who were stopped and let go without summons or arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast this to a May 29 front-page New York Times profile calling Thompson &quot;steadfastly unwilling to join the tear-it-down chorus&quot; on stop-and-frisk. The Times characterized Thompson as saying that campaign jousting had &quot;glossed over its usefulness as a police tool, even as he forcefully criticized its excesses over the past few years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report continued: &quot;His criminal justice platform, he said, 'isn't about running for mayor; it's about governing.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the same careful Bill Thompson who visited The Daily News editorial board on July 26. He was asked then: &quot;What's the racial motivation, if there is one, behind stop and frisk?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson answered: &quot;If 90% of the people who are stopped and frisked are black and Hispanic, then there is a racial component to it. . . . Black and Hispanic communities feel like they're being targeted, that they're being targeted for the excessive use of stop-and-frisk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Controller John Liu, the News asked: &quot;One of your rivals... uses the words 'racial profiling' . . . Is that a factor in all this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do communities feel profiled? Yes . . . But also, at the same point, used correctly, it's a useful police tool. I don't care what my rivals have said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note the emphasis: Though communities feel profiled, Thompson would not then pin the NYPD with profiling intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Bill Thompson uses the term without hesitation. Why? A likely answer: Thompson is drawing 22% support among African-American Democratic likely primary voters, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll. That's a couple of points behind sexting liar Anthony Weiner and about tied with Council Speaker Christine Quinn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With blacks so evenly divided, Quinn topped the pack with 27% of the support among all voters, while Thompson (20%) and Public Advocate Bill de Blasio (21%) were essentially tied in the critical competition for second place - and a spot in a runoff primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on Thompson's clearly shifting and heating rhetoric, the distressing conclusion is that he is saying what he thinks he must in order to, at least, stay in the hunt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Bethesda, Maryland man was beaten and robbed early on Saturday by three black men who approached him as he was walking in Washington, DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are investigating the robbery as a hate crime since one of the men yelled, ``this is for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin'' before attacking the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men threw the victim to the ground and kicked him before leaving with his wallet and iPhone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim suffered minor injuries and declined medical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack comes two weeks after a jury found George Zimmerman not-guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in February 2012, even though he admitted to shooting the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the l verdict was handed down, Martin's family and supporters called for non-violence. ``It's all right to be vocal, but we don't want to be violent,'' Reverend Walter T. Richardson said. ``We've already lost one soul and we don't want to lose any more.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado doesn't have a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law that allows gun owners, under certain circumstances, to use deadly force on the streets even if they have an option to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But state law and case history provide some level of immunity to those who use deadly force in self defense in Colorado, prosecutors said. And the state was the first to enact &quot;make my day&quot; legislation, giving homeowners immunity if they shoot and kill intruders, still one of the strongest such laws in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person killed in a justifiable homicide in Colorado may be armed with no more than his fists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, the acquittal of George Zimmerman for shooting Trayvon Martin has ignited a national debate about stand your ground laws, though Zimmerman did not invoke the law in his defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida law permits deadly force wherever someone &quot;reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm&quot; to himself or another. They have no duty to retreat. More than 20 states, not including Colorado, have such laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Colorado, to use a gun in self defense, the shooter must have reason to believe that he or someone else would otherwise suffer serious bodily injury or death. In effect, the law affords protection similar to that provided under &quot;stand your ground,&quot; Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think a jury would have found Zimmerman not guilty in Colorado, just based on self defense,&quot; Morrissey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right stops at the door</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introduced in 1985 as the Homeowner Protection Act, &quot;make my day&quot; gives Colorado residents the right to shoot and kill an intruder if they believe the person intends to commit a crime and use physical force, &quot;no matter how slight.&quot; That extraordinary right stops at the door. Front porches and backyards don't count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, criminal charges can vary vastly, depending on whether a shooting occurred inside or outside the threshold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a marked difference between what you can do in your home and what you can do in your yard,&quot; Morrissey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Colorado, as in Florida, fists can be deemed deadly weapons that justify gun use outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month in Denver, a man shot and killed Charles McLaughlin, a drunken 29 year old man who had tried to force his way into the man's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resident fired two shots as McLaughlin, with fists clenched according to a witness, approached him in the front yard. Both shots struck him in the chest. The shooter told a detective &quot;he was afraid if the man got his hands on him, the man would have killed him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district attorney's office decided the shooter had acted in self defense and did not file criminal charges but noted this was not a &quot;make my day&quot; case. The shooting occurred outside the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody records how often &quot;make my day&quot; is used as a defense against criminal charges in Colorado, or how often charges are not filed based on the law. But an informal survey by Doug Wilson, the state public defender, found there have been at least 22 cases in his agency's offices in the past year in which the law was cited as a defense. Two ended with jury acquittals, two were dismissed by district attorneys, four were plea bargained and seven others are pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty eight years after its enactment, &quot;the 'make my day' statute is a unique animal,&quot; said Scott Robinson, a prominent Denver criminal defense lawyer. &quot;It's one of a kind in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said homeowners who meet the law's criteria can be found immune from prosecution and lawsuits, can be exonerated before trial by either the district attorney or a judge and can raise the same defense if the case goes to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And inside the home, the threat level justifying gun use is low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I think you're going to punch me in the arm and you're in my house illegally, I can shoot you,&quot; Wilson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homeowner exoneratedThat figured into a 2012 Boulder case in which a homeowner shot an intoxicated young woman who walked into his bedroom after 3 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homeowners Timothy Justice and Doreen Orion were asleep in bed. They had shut off the lights and closed the blinds but left one side of their bedroom French door open for ventilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They awoke to find an intruder had come in through the sliding screen door, carrying what looked to them like a flashlight. They shouted at the person to leave and warned they had a gun. The intruder kept coming. Justice fired one shot toward the light, striking a Zoey Ripple in the hip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ripple told a detective she thought she was at a friend's house and was confused by all the shouting and yelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district attorney's office quickly exonerated Justice, citing the &quot;make my day&quot; law, and filed a felony trespassing charge against Ripple. Boulder District Attorney Stan Garnett called the results just. But &quot;it would have been a more complex case without that law, that's fair to say,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ripple's attorney, Colette Cribari, contends the law makes it too easy to dismiss shootings inside dwellings without much thought. &quot;Zoey came into the place, she was armed with a cellphone,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, 81 year old homeowner Robert Wallace was charged with attempted first degree murder when he fired his gun at Alvaro Cardona and Damacio Torres Ochoa, two men in a pickup stealing a flatbed trailer outside his Wheat Ridge home in 2010. One shot struck Cardona in the face, blinding him and causing a serious brain injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'Make my day' did not apply. He was not in danger in his residence,&quot; said Pete Weir, the district attorney in Jefferson County. &quot;Somebody fleeing from the scene, you're just not allowed to be shooting at them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wallace ultimately pleaded no contest to reduced charges and did not go to prison. He is 84 now. In an interview last week, he said he had no idea he was breaking the law and did not know he had shot one of the men until police came to arrest him days later for attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he fired at the men driving off in the dark, &quot;the trailer almost ran me over,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimates he spent $70,000 on legal fees and related costs. &quot;That took away my nest egg,&quot; he said. He also spent $5,000 for a new chain link fence around the field beside his small brick house on busy Sheridan Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It encloses the flatbed trailer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As most of your readers hopefully know by now, the Zimmerman case had nothing at all to do with the stand-your-ground law. As Humboldt County District Attorney Paul Gallegos points out, all &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; does is eliminate the &quot;duty to retreat&quot; when faced with lethal force. (&quot;Gallegos weighs in on stand-your-ground laws,&quot; Times-Standard, July 21, Page A1) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The citizens in over 30 states have decided that if faced with deadly force yourself, you should be able to respond with deadly force of your own, without the burden of trying to seek escape, which may get you killed, and without the threat of prosecutors taking away your liberty for not using an escape route you simply may not have seen, or deemed unsafe to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What stand-your-ground laws do not do is allow you to use deadly force in any situation where you are not in fear of great bodily injury or death. That does not change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that is why it is a ridiculous question to ask, as our president did, whether Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have &quot;stood his ground&quot; and shot Mr. Zimmerman that night if Trayvon had been armed. No, Mr. President, he could not. You cannot claim you are in imminent fear of great bodily injury or death simply because someone may have been following you in a place they had every right to be.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE | In the two weeks since a group of protesters initiated a sit-in in Gov. Rick Scott's office to push for a special legislative session, organizers point to growing momentum, but it remains unclear if their ultimate goal is within reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters, led by a group called the Dream Defenders, have received national spotlight, secured a meeting with Scott, and claim to have support of roughly 20 percent of the Legislature. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are seeking passage of the &quot;Trayvon Martin Civil Rights Act,&quot; which would repeal the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, reform Florida's zero tolerance policies, and consider new laws that would target racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground&quot; received national attention after Martin, 17, was killed in Seminole County by George Zimmerman, who claimed self-defense. Though Zimmerman, who was acquitted, did not focus on &quot;stand your ground&quot; during the trial, the verdict sparked protests across the country from those who want the laws repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 14 days, protesters in Florida say they have momentum at their back, but it remains unlikely that Scott will call lawmakers back to Tallahassee for a special legislative session. &nbsp;On the second night of protests, he met with organizers and told them he opposes the idea and continues to support the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally believe that the 'stand your ground' law should stay on the books,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That position could spell a lengthy standoff with protesters who say they are not leaving Scott's office until a special session is called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are educating more people about the issues, and the more they learn about the issues the more they support us,&quot; said Gonzalo Vizcardo, an organizer with Dream Defenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said protesters plan to announce Tuesday the names of roughly 20 percent of the Legislature that have either signed, or plan to sign formal letters of support. State law allows Secretary of State Ken Detzner to ask the 160 members of the Legislature if they want a special session. If 32 members agree to the special session, it then requires a three-fifths vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, organizers have announced the support of five House Democrats, but no Republicans. They met Monday with state Rep. Halsey Beshears, a Monticello Republican, who said he supports &quot;stand your ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underlying a state of tension between the protesters and GOP lawmakers, when Beshears went to the bathroom, a small group of protesters plotted a strategy for getting the second-year to talk more freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It focused on creating gaps of silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Force him to respond,&quot; said Barbara DeVane, who is with Florida Now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida Department of Law Enforcement says the protesters have cost the state an additional $77,697 in overtime costs. Department spokeswoman Gretl Plessenger says there have been no reports of damage. In a precautionary step, officials have removed portraits of past governors that line the hallway leading to Scott's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also refuted claims protesters made over the weekend that Capitol Police would not let staffers bring protesters food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the Capitol closes, Capitol Police will not open the door for anyone,&quot; Plessenger said. &quot;Those rules have been in place the first two weekends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of &quot;stand your ground&quot; point to recent polls that show 50 percent of Floridians support the law, a much higher percentage than those who oppose it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent poll showed 50 percent want the law to remain unchanged, 31 percent want it changed, while just 13 percent of people want a full repeal. The poll was conducted by Republican firm Viewpoint Florida, but it reflects other recent polls on the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom is a loaded word, one with so many definitions, nuances and interpretations. Over the centuries the quest for freedom has been the cause of much suffering and much rejoicing. Thousands have died fighting for it or protecting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his 1859 work On Liberty, John Stuart Mill examines &quot;the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.&quot; In other words, what freedoms can individuals consider rightfully theirs to enjoy? He points out that in ancient times liberty was protection against political tyrants and &quot; ... the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.&quot; He asserts the vital role of the press as one of the defences against &quot;corrupt or tyrannical government.&quot; I don't think we can argue against any of these premises since they are the foundation of modern democracies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1948 the United Nations issued the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaimed: &quot;recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.&quot; The 30 Articles include the right to education, freedom of thought and religion and prohibition of the slave trade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian Bill of Rights, passed in 1960, echoes the basic tenets of the UN Declaration and assures all Canadians of the following basic rights:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to equality before the law and the protection of the law;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of religion;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of speech;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of assembly and association;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, anyone arrested or detained is presumed innocent until proven guilty and must not be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The rights to have a fair hearing and retain counsel are also guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first 10 Amendments of the American Constitution that were passed in 1789 are called the country's Bill of Rights. The rights of the individual such as freedom of speech, religion and the press are enshrined in these Amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would seem that there is a consensus among nations that are signatories to the declaration that freedom in its many manifestations is an inherent right of all peoples. Yet we do not have to look far to see that the struggle for freedom with dignity is far from over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, demonstrators' right to freedom of assembly certainly was violated during the G20 Summit in Toronto in 2011. Ashley Smith certainly was subjected to cruel and unusual treatment and punishment during her incarceration. Surely mercy and compassion should have triumphed over &quot;justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of human trafficking appear all too often in the media. Who would have thought that slavery would be an issue in 2013?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations' stand on the right to education has found a worthy champion in a young Pakistani woman named Malala Yousafzai who suffered a bullet wound to the head for her outspoken advocacy of education for girls. Unfortunately, her case is not unusual since there are still many countries in the world that deny their citizens the right to free speech and assembly. Chinese, Cuban and Russian prisons house political dissidents who have been imprisoned without trial or with a sham trial with a predetermined verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr. were fierce champions for their people's fight for freedom. Mandela persevered and eventually apartheid was overthrown in South Africa. In the U.S., the recent verdict in the Trayvon Martin case demonstrates that &quot;equality before the law&quot; is not yet fully in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From these few examples we can infer that pursuit of freedom has had an uneven journey through human history. The story still is being written, but there is cause for hope and optimism. We are a &quot;global village,&quot; to use Marshall McLuhan's term, in the sense that we know instantly through the media when our rights and freedoms are threatened. Protests are immediate, often sparked by the social media that are quick to reveal misdeeds. It is hard to hide from scrutiny these days with all the camera phones ready to snap into action. If they don't capture the moment, then CCTV cameras will. Who knew that such invasive gadgets could be a force for good?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Opinion, July 25)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I fail to correlate the writer's piece with the Trayvon Martin story. So the writer had an intruder in his house. Even if he was a proud legal Canadian gun owner, his guns would have be locked away, and separated by ammunition in another box, guaranteeing safety to the intruder. Even if the intruder had decided to rob, injure, or do whatever he felt like, the Young Offenders Act would protect the accused, and forgive him at the age of 18. Besides being lucky, I would consider the writer more of a sitting duck rather than a proud Canadian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, too, am a proud Canadian. With a wife from Chicago, I can tell you our race issues don't run as deep as our neighbours to the south, and the standard of living is somewhat better. But holding up a system that gives the wolves in society more benefit than the lambs is just naive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer's attempts to bring the two issues together tugs at the heart strings, but fails to come to a logical conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and George Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman case, the mainstream media has to take some of the blame for using the race card to the fullest extent. Zimmerman was not a racist - he dated a black girl, mentored young black males in need and took on the police over the treatment of a homeless black man. He never used racist slurs and saw crime in terms of right and wrong. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about the same time as the Martin shooting, elsewhere in the State of Florida there was a 16-year-old black youth sentenced to life in prison for shooting to death two white people just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Just weeks after the Martin shooting, in Phoenix, Ariz., a similar shooting took place at a restaurant involving a black motorist shooting and killing an unarmed &quot;white Hispanic&quot; male in a confrontation. The black motorist used Arizona's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and to date has not been charged. I do not recall any protests or media frenzy condemning the black motorist for shooting an unarmed man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in some states were brought in because of the increase in violent crime. It is mostly blacks, women and vulnerable people who benefit the most from these laws. As for being racist, it is mostly blacks who are the victims of violent crime, committed by other blacks in many high-crime areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political correctness denies the truth or root causes in many cases. In turn, most media outlets are afraid to admit or apologize for it. The same media that question or criticize the Second Amendment will do anything to defend the First Amendment, even if a network like NBC doctored the 911 call by Zimmerman, who is now suing the network. Let's hope he wins.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO - In dark sunglasses and a uniform studded with medals, Egypt's top general is everywhere, looking down from posters and banners proclaiming him &quot;lion of the nation.&quot; Adoring songs vow &quot;We are behind you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely a month after he removed the elected president, Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is riding a wave of adulation, drawing comparisons between him and modern Egypt's first charismatic strongman, former President Gamal Abdel-Nasser. State media and pro-military TV channels and newspapers have done everything they can to fuel the fervor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I worry about el-Sissi and the possible arrogance of the victor. And I fear him if he decides that the army is stronger than any future president that he will control like a puppet,&quot; wrote Mohammed Fathy, a columnist in the newspaper Al-Watan. &quot;The admiration for him has gone beyond normal levels and is now more like deifying him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hype has swelled to the point that some are convinced el-Sissi will take off his uniform and run for president in elections due to take place early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Panel backs lung cancer screening for certain heavy smokers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, government advisers are recommending screening for lung cancer, saying certain current and former heavy smokers should get annual scans to cut their chances of dying of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it becomes final as expected, the advice by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force would clear the way for insurers to cover CT scans, a type of X-ray, for those at greatest risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would be people ages 55 through 79 who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 30 years or the equivalent, such as two packs a day for 15 years. Whether screening would help younger or lighter smokers isn't known, so scans are not advised for them. They also aren't for people who quit at least 15 years ago, or people too sick or frail to undergo cancer treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The evidence shows we can prevent a substantial number of lung cancer deaths by screening&quot; - about 20,000 of the 160,000 that occur each year in the United States, said Dr. Michael LeFevre, a task force leader and family physician at the University of Missouri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wave of car bombings in Iraq kills at least 58</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD - More than a dozen explosions, mainly from car bombs, ripped through marketplaces, parking lots, a cafe and rush-hour crowds in Iraq on Monday, killing at least 58 people and pushing the country's death toll for the month of July toward the 700 mark, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bombings - 18 in all - are part of a wave of bloodshed that has swept across the country since April, killing more than 3,000 people and worsening the already strained ties between Iraq's Sunni minority and the Shiite-led government. The scale and pace of the violence, unseen since the darkest days of the country's insurgency, have fanned fears of a return to the widespread sectarian bloodletting that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two days left in July, the month's death toll now stands at 680, according to an Associated Press count. Most of those have come during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of dawn-to-dusk fasting that began July 10, making it Iraq's bloodiest since 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marint's mother: Repeal stand-ground law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - The mother of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin joined a prominent African-American lawyers organization in vowing Monday to keep the pressure on legislators to repeal or overhaul &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton repeated her assertion that neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder&quot; in the 2012 killing of her son largely because of Florida's self-defense law, which generally removed a person's duty to retreat if possible in the face of danger. It was the first of its kind in the nation when passed in 2005. Now, about two dozen states have similar laws, but the focus of repeal efforts is squarely on Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to change the law so that this doesn't happen to someone else's child,&quot; Fulton told reporters at the National Bar Association's annual meeting. &quot;My son wasn't doing anything wrong. He was simply walking home. He wasn't a suspect.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy's shame</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy, Flavio Rizzo argues in the wake of the ugly racist attacks on its first black minister Cecile Kyenge, is a racist nation. But if the birthplace of the Renaissance is a racist nation, it begs asking: why? Rizzo believes it is because in Italy, indeed in all post-colonial countries, &quot;the link between personal and cultural identity in these countries is never made. The other stays the other.&quot; In Italy specifically, he argues, a large part of the population &quot;systematically accept homophobia, racism, and womanising as part of a national weakness, a disease one cannot get rid of.&quot; Is there a way out of this disgrace? &quot;We can only hope that Italians will start to make their own Frantz Fanon scream, 'Oh my body, make of me always a man who questions',&quot; Rizzo says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sermon on race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACROSS half a continent and an ocean from Italy, America too is seized with a debate on race relations following the killing of Trayvon Martin. And it is no less ugly either. &quot;Many of George Zimmerman's staunchest defenders found themselves seized by a sudden concern for African-American murder victims in Chicago,&quot; writes Kelefa Sanneh. &quot;Among the strangest reactions of all, though, was an essay called 'Facing Facts about Race' Victor Davis Hanson published on National Review Online. Hanson's broader aim is to focus attention on what seems to him a startling fact: that 'a small percentage of Americans are committing violent crimes at rates far exceeding their proportion of general population'.&quot; Sanneh adds, &quot;One hesitates to disagree, but research shows something different. Studies suggest that African-Americans are over-represented among both offenders and victims. It's strange, then, to read Hanson writing as if the fear of violent crime was mainly a 'white' problem, about which African-Americans might be uninformed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rogue superpower</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has America, that &quot;beacon of freedom and liberty&quot; gone rogue? To the extent that it is willing to go to any length to silence dissent? It certainly has, argues Tom Engelhardt. Just consider Barack Obama's war on whistleblowers. His administration has prosecuted more whistleblowers-seven-than all previous governments combined. And the hounding of Edward Snowden has been front-paged across the world. But it isn't just about Snowden. &quot;In the Cold War years, if you opposed one of the two superpowers or its allies, the other was usually ready to open its arms to you. Today, if you are a 'dissident' and need asylum from the only superpower left, there's essentially none to be had.&quot; Engelhardt says. &quot;If Snowden is proving one thing, it's this: in 2013, Planet Earth isn't big enough to protect the American version of 'dissidents'. Instead, it looks ever more like a giant prison with a single implacable policeman, judge, jury, and jailer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN times when an institution faces a credibility crisis, someone must stand up, speak out and hold out the hope if it is to be rescued. Helen Thomas, the veteran American journalist who died recently aged 92, did just that for journalism, every chance she got. &quot;She talked about the lies that led us into the Iraq War and the pale, puny stuff that was being passed off for journalism nowadays,&quot; Courtney E Martin, recalling Thomas speaking at the Omega Institute's 2009 Women &amp; Power Conference, says &quot;We were speaking two different languages. Mine was hopeful, perhaps naive; I gave the audience anecdotes that I knew they would be comforted by. Hers was unapologetically blunt; she didn't appear to care about comforting people.&quot; Thomas stood out because she spoke truth to power at a time &quot;when journalism looked less and less like the province of truth-tellers and more and more like the province of spin-doctors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have to be the laughingstock to the world. A nation of people that once was proud of themselves, their accomplishments and heritage. We have become a nation of blame-shifters, back-biters and finger-pointers. The leaders in this nation went to serve and find solutions, now all they bring is chaos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bible says in Luke 11:17, &quot;Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall ... .&quot; These words that Jesus spoke have never been truer in this nation than now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have weighed in on the Martin and Zimmerman case. They have painted Mr. Zimmerman as a racist, when there is no evidence to support their cause. It would really be nice if these people who have tremendous status would try to reach out to the nation as whole. Not one of them reaches out to the music industry that produces music that is degrading to the African American community, and it is the same for Hollywood celebrities. I find it appalling and sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the stories and reporting I have seen about Mr. Zimmerman, he was not a racist. If anything he was in there trying to help the black community. He and his wife had taken in a brother and sister that lived with them because they had nowhere to live; he spoke out when a homeless black woman was attacked and left for dead, he took it all the way to the city council. He tutored young black students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bureau of Justice says 85 percent of young black men murdered in this country are killed by other black men. That is astonishing. So when I hear Obama, Jackson and Sharpton making statements about the Martin/Zimmerman trial, I am asking myself why aren't they trying to bring healing and find solutions, instead of bringing more dread and heartache. The sad part is I think it is all for their own notoriety; it isn't even for Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chaos and division never solve anything, but keep people anxious and at odds with each other, and ultimately bring destruction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans have typecast Obama according to their own fears and expectations of a black man in the White House. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For much of his public life, Barack Obama has been navigating between people who think he is too black and people who think he is not black enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former group speaks mostly in dog-whistle innuendo and focuses on proxy issues to emphasize Obama's ostensible otherness: his birth certificate, his supposed adherence to ''black liberation theology'' (presumably before he converted to Islam), his ''Kenyan, anticolonial'' worldview. Jonathan Alter's recent book on Obama's presidency sums up these notions as symptoms of ''Obama Derangement Syndrome'' - a disorder whose subtext is more often than not: He's too black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side are African-Americans and liberals who are disappointed that Obama has not made it his special mission to call out the racism that still festers in American society and rectify the racial imbalance in our economy, in our schools, in our justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It has, at times, been painful to watch this particular president's calibrated, cautious and sometimes callous treatment of his most loyal constituency,'' the radio and TV host Tavis Smiley told The New York Times's Jodi Kantor last year. That was one of the gentler rebukes from the not-black-enough camp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama believes he best serves the country, and ultimately the interests of black Americans, by being the president of America, not the president of black America. Even when he speaks eloquently on the subject, as he did in his 2008 speech in Philadelphia, he presents himself as a bridge between white and black rather than the civil rights leader-in-chief. And even when his administration has undertaken reforms that address racial injustice - reinvigorating the moribund civil rights division of the Justice Department, for example - he does not call a news conference and make a big deal of it. This is certainly calibrated and cautious. But callous?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's remarks on the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - ''could have been me 35 years ago'' - reanimated the old divide. From the he's-too-black sideline the president was predictably accused of indulging in ''racial victimology'' and ''race baiting.'' On the other side, some of those who had yearned for Obama to be more outspoken seized on his riff as a turning point; the president, a Detroit radio host exulted, ''showed his brother card.'' Charles Ogletree, a Harvard law professor who has known Obama for 25 years, told NPR he felt like ''turning cartwheels'' when he heard the remarks, and he declared he would now have to rethink a book-in-the-works, in which he had planned to criticize the president's timidity on race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It seems to me he threw caution to the wind,'' Ogletree told me. ''It opens up a whole new chapter of Barack Obama.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does it? I, too, found Obama's words moving in their emotional warmth and empathy. But if you go back and read them, now that the heat of the moment has cooled, you will see they are carefully measured and completely consistent with what he has said in his writing and speaking since he entered public life. The warrior against racism that critics on the right deplore and critics on the left demand is nowhere to be found. His comments on the pain and humiliation of racial profiling, which got the most attention, reprise a theme that goes back at least to his days as a state senator. His respectful treatment of the court that acquitted Martin's killer and his nod to the pathologies of the black underclass got less notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He basically says, try to understand this issue from the perspective of people different from yourself,'' said Thomas Sugrue, a University of Pennsylvania historian who has written a book-length study of Obama and race. ''And he says it to black folks and white folks.'' But somehow listeners on both sides hear what they expect to hear, Sugrue said, on one side ''a prophetic Martin Luther King Jr.,'' on the other side ''a pent-up Black Panther waiting to explode.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a name for that: racial profiling. People may no longer give Obama suspicious glares in department stores or clutch their purses when he enters an elevator, but they have typecast him according to their own fears and expectations of a black man in the White House. They are still profiling Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who hope his Trayvon talk signaled a new presidential activism on race will be watching two litmus tests. The first is whether Obama's Justice Department will file a civil rights suit against George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch enthusiast who shot Martin dead. The N.A.A.C.P. says more than a million people have signed petitions calling for Justice to prosecute Zimmerman for a hate crime. The second is whether the president will offer a cabinet post to Ray Kelly, the New York police commissioner who has presided over the aggressive stop-and-frisk policing of mostly black and Latino men. Obama's public praise of Kelly as a possible secretary of homeland security prompted anger and amazement, some of it on this page. Was the president indifferent to Kelly's role as, in Ta-Nehisi Coates's words, ''the proprietor of the largest local racial profiling operation in the country,'' or simply inattentive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My guess is that the president will navigate those straits as he always has when race looms, carefully and without fanfare. If he is true to form, he will quietly pass over Kelly, because it's now clear the appointment would become a major distraction from his agenda, because racial profiling is a lifelong personal sore spot for Obama, and because he has other, less polarizing options. He will leave George Zimmerman's fate to Attorney General Eric Holder, who seems likely to conclude that a hate-crimes case would not stick and would be seen as putting politics over law. (The federal statute says it's not enough to prove Zimmerman pursued Martin because of his race; the government would have to prove that racial prejudice was his motive for killing the teenager.) In his remarks on the case, Obama seemed to hint that the feds would not step in where the state has already ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if Obama's Trayvon moment was not the debut of a new, more activist president, was it at least the beginning of a national conversation about race? If so, I doubt it will be a conversation led by the president. When race came up in an interview published in Sunday's New York Times, he promptly segued into a discussion of economic strains on the social fabric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's O.K. President Obama has an economy to heal, a foreign policy to run, a daunting agenda blockaded by an intransigent opposition. Randall Kennedy, another Harvard law professor who has studied Obama and criticized him for a lack of audacity, says frustration should be tempered by realism. ''My view of Obama is as a Jackie Robinson figure,'' Kennedy told me. ''Jackie Robinson breaks the color barrier and encounters all sorts of denigration, people spitting on him, and because he was a pioneer he had to be above it all. ... People expect Obama now to all of a sudden jump into this totally messy issue of race and the administration of criminal justice? It's completely implausible. To do it would require a major investment of political capital.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, come to think of it, why is that his special responsibility anyway?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There's sort of a persistent misperception that talking about race is black folk's burden,'' said Benjamin Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P., when I asked him about Obama's obligation. ''Ultimately, only men can end sexism, and only white people can end racism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wouldn't you like to hear John Boehner or Mitch McConnell or Chris Christie or Rick Perry own up as candidly as the president has to the corrosive vestiges of racism in our society? Now that might be an occasion to turn cartwheels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton missed an opportunity to further racial harmony when George Zimmerman was acquitted of the killing of their son. They could have expressed their disappointment with the decision of the jury, but then gone on to say that they forgive George Zimmerman and encouraged the black community to do the same. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone in Lancaster County remembers the example set by the Amish community in the wake of the Nickel Mine killings. The girls in that school were truly innocent children who had no way to escape the man who targeted them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have chosen to go back to the house where he was staying rather than confronting George Zimmerman. He made a tragic choice that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman could have chosen to leave the scene and let the police deal with crime in his neighborhood, but he did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result was that a young man lost his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's parents could bring no greater honor to their son than to have people remember that his death was used to promote racial harmony, which is in the best interest of all Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton will have no peace until they can offer forgiveness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 30--HAMILTON -- Twenty African students who have spent most of their summer in Hamilton gathered at Miami Downtown Monday night to recap their experience and share the projects they plan to take back to their homes this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students came here from from Botswana, Uganda, Kenya and Zambia to learn about civic engagement at Miami University Hamilton this summer, a program made possible by a grant of $238,000 from the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, according to Sarah Woiteshek, director of the campus' Center for Civic Engagement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange program, known as the Study of the United States Institute, has the potential to be renewed for additional two years, Woiteshek said, depending on whether the funding will be available. The campus applied to the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to host the institute, and won out over about a dozen other colleges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe the U.S. State Department funded our program, in part, because of our location in the city of Hamilton,&quot; she said. &quot;Our city is in a state of beautiful transition anchored by residents engaged in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hamilton's evolution from a great industrial city to one striving to reinvent itself provides an intriguing backdrop for our students to learn the tremendous power of citizen action,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grant allowed for 10 local students to be regional fellows to live with the students during their stay and help facilitate their visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the five-week institute, the students attended seminars and workshops on U.S. government structures, leadership, community organizing, and global citizenship. They also attended local City Council meetings and toured the Butler County Board of Elections to learn about the American voting process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The primary goal of the SUSI program is to develop a strong relationship with each student and foster a culture of mutual understanding between the United States and each student's home country,&quot; Woiteshek said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They lived in Peabody Hall on the Western Campus in Oxford, and took advantage of that proximity to study the civil rights movement, especially the Freedom Summer project of the 1960s in which the campus served as the launching point for a voter registration drive in the South, which resulted in the murder of three students in Mississippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visiting students found that to be an eye-opening learning experience, especially in light of the Trayvon Martin case being tried in Florida during their stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may not call it civil rights,&quot; said Seth Odongo, a student at Moi University in Kenya, &quot;but it's the struggle for women to get education and the students' struggle to get work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also saw how the great leaders of this country talk about it, how people believe in the just system even if they do not agree with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the students were immersed in local culture, observing Hamilton's Independence Day celebration and concerts at RiversEdge Amphitheatre, they also made a side trip to Boston, where they attended the Frontiers of Democracy conference and explored the history of the American Revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Participation in American community work will help our international students prepare to engage in their own local communities,&quot; Woiteshek said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their workshops and classes, each student picked a topic of interest and concern and created presentations as to how they would use what they learned to solve problems in their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civic issues included community development, substance abuse, unemployment, child abuse, youth engagement, women empowerment, environmental protection and access to education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cynthia Ichaminya, an engineering student from Kenya, chose substance abuse as her topic because she has seen how alcohol abuse has affected her peers. Her poster presentation on Monday included a photo of a student sleeping in a wheelbarrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our program goes from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and so students cope with the stress by drinking,&quot; she said. &quot;But of the 90 people who started the program with me, only 45 will complete it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I plan to form a non-profit organization to help build awareness of the problem and to increase the number of students who stay in school and graduate,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ichaminya said that she had to go through a very rigorous process to earn a spot on the Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to apply through the U.S. Embassy in my country,&quot; she said. &quot;There were 200 students who applied and only six from Kenya are in the program.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have slept 28 hours,&quot; said Leo Hailey, from Botho College in Botswana. &quot;That is how good America has been. We should be ready to give something back when we get home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON _ Invoking the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, two Democratic congressmen joined civil rights leaders Tuesday to promote legislation abolishing racial profiling by police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Civil rights is still the unfinished business of this nation,&quot; said Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. &quot;It is against the values of America to single out a person because of their race or religion or ethnic background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial profiling concerns have boiled over after neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was found not guilty earlier this month in Martin's death. While the legislation would not have directly applied to Zimmerman, as he is not a police officer, Cardin described Martin's killing as a tragedy that resulted from racial profiling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury has spoken as to the criminal liability, but there is no question that but for racial profiling, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would be alive today,&quot; Cardin said. &quot;He was identified solely because of what he looked like, rather than any fact related to an individual crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror in the Zimmerman case, only identified by her juror number B37, told CNN that she did not believe race was a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, sponsored by Cardin in the Senate and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in the House of Representatives, prevents police from identifying suspects based on a person's race, religion, national origin or ethnicity. It also mandates training on racial profiling and prioritizes funds for departments that restrict the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration has made small steps to address racial profiling; when Attorney General Eric Holder took office in 2009, he called for a review of the Justice Department's racial profiling guidance, but the process is still ongoing. A 2004 Amnesty International report found that more than 32 million Americans have been victims of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margaret Huang, the executive director of the Rights Working Group, a human rights coalition, said that she believes Holder is close to releasing revisions to the guidance but is worried that exceptions for national security or border security would &quot;swallow the rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial profiling &quot;doesn't work, regardless of what the context is,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Conyers said that he expected the push to be a bipartisan effort, both the House bill and its Senate companion have failed to attract any Republican co-sponsors. Conyers, who has been filing the bill since 2001, had only one Republican co-sponsor on his last version of the bill in 2011, Illinois Rep. Timothy Johnson. Johnson has since retired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many GOP senators were reluctant to comment on the bill outside of their weekly meeting, citing unfamiliarity with it. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said that while he would look at the legislation, he felt hesitant to limit the discretion and judgment of a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make sure that our police have the ability and the tools to protect the American people,&quot; he said. &quot;I would have concerns about restricting police from being able to do their jobs, but ... people have to be treated fairly and we certainly can't discriminate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Fraternal Order of Police objected to the bill at a 2011 hearing, saying that it solved a &quot;problem that doesn't exist&quot; and feared that the overbroad definition of racial profiling could handcuff officers. While the group did not return a request for comment Tuesday, its website said the organization opposes the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is going on at East Garrison?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the streets are mostly open to traffic, we took a drive through the area. What we found was not very good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Many sections of the bike lanes are narrower than required in California, thereby illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The bike route is not done correctly, especially on a section only 24 feet wide that intersects Reservation Road, a major thoroughfare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The car bottomed out several times, something that has never happened before. Weren't the roads built correctly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What else has the developer done illegally or incorrectly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I tried to engage a representative of the developer, he blew me off and walked away. If nothing else, the company should be concerned about liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this another situation where a developer will build something, cut every corner possible, then take the profits and leave, to let local government fix the problems left behind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Petersen<BR>Salinas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reopening Intergarrison Road a great idea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many thanks to the county Board of Supervisors for having the courage and foresight to reopen Intergarrison Road. The motion, as framed, provides access and parking to the Jerry Smith Corridor for recreational users and to the general populace to public roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will provide significant relief to the traffic on Highway 68 and Imjin Parkway, reducing our carbon footprint and a providing a needed alternative route into the former Fort Ord. In time it will connect to the Eastside Parkway, providing a bypass around CSU Monterey Bay and a third route into the Monterey Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To those concerned about safety, I can only suggest being careful. Walk facing traffic, and as my parents taught me many years ago, look both ways before you cross the street.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Child prostitution like any business exists only because there is a market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most culpable party in the child prostitution scene is the customer who hires the child and infuses money into the system. No pimp would offer an underage person if there was no money to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the July 30 article about the rescue of teenagers from prostitution by Operation Cross Country, there was no mention of the arrest of the johns. I hope this was an omission only in the article and not an omission in Operation Cross Country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entering a darkened area in pursuit of a suspect, I would have drawn my gun before entering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman had his gun in hand long before facing Trayvon Martin. Martin grabbed at the gun, missed, but managed to grab Zimmerman's clothes or wrist. Martin began screaming for help and Zimmerman broke away or at least managed to turn the gun and shot Martin in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proof?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he received 30 to 35 mixed martial arts strikes. If so, his face would look like hamburger. A man's first instinct is to protect his head and face from further damage, not searching for his gun. Had his head been &quot;slammed&quot; against the pavement with force 10 or so times, he would have a skull fracture, be stunned or unconscious with severe head wounds, not scratches, and would be bleeding profusely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His story is totally unbelievable, filled with inconsistencies bordering on incredulity. The prosecution failed miserably and a murderer got away scot-free.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If ever the United States needed comprehensive immigration reform, now is the time, again. If ever selfish and selfless motives coincide this is it   again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eliminating second-class status assigned to 12 million people will liberate economic and social energy that just may be the savior of us all. Now we see the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations marching arm in arm for reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locally, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group and the California Strawberry Commission sang a duet in public for the same cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libertarian think tanks such as the Cato Institute have studied the issue and concluded that, never mind the specific beneficiaries involved, capitalism itself gets a boost and the benefits are spread throughout the population. Every city in our tri-county area has passed a resolution supporting comprehensive reform, except the city of Carmel. All three boards of supervisors in the tri-county area passed the same resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Systems created along caste and class with specific populations held in a subterranean status have built into their society and economy retarding forces, driving down freedom of expression and thwarting tremendous creative potential that yearns to breathe free.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video is shocking. A solitary man apparently waving a knife on an empty Toronto streetcar is shot and killed by police. Nine shots in all - three in one burst and then another six together - are heard within 13 seconds. Throughout the video, which lasts about two minutes, there are demands from the police to &quot;drop the knife!&quot; The man yells obscenities at the police and is warned words that sound like: &quot;If you take one step in this direction you're finished.&quot; The shots started as the man appeared to be starting to leave the streetcar and moving towards the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the shooting there have been calls for &quot;justice&quot; and comparisons to the Trayvon Martin case. Vigils are planned and the man's family is hiring a lawyer. The police are being held to account for what is being widely portrayed as an overreaction bordering on outright murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is it so? Videos can be highly misleading and drawing conclusions after watching, and re-watching, a short video is very different from dealing with a man with a knife. The video shows the man walking to the streetcar door and apparently beginning to leave the streetcar, still holding the knife and approaching the police. It was only then that the police fired. The video will be scrutinized by experts, but even those trained in such investigations will never be in that moment the way the officers on the scene were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the investigation must move forward, to determine whether this sad incident constitutes a justified police shooting. The law regarding deadly force is very clear. A police officer is justified in using force that is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm if the police officer &quot;believes on reasonable grounds that the force is necessary for the purpose of protecting the [police officer] or any other person from imminent or future death or grievous bodily harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The courts have been clear that actions taken in the heat of the moment are to be judged on the basis of the circumstances. Here police were dealing with an armed man, refusing to put down his weapon and who was approaching the police in what seemed like a threatening manner. On the surface, it would seem that the police involved have a legitimate claim to having no alternative but the use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ontario, police are trained in a use-of-force protocol and do not resort to deadly force on a regular basis. That is why this story is so extraordinary. People are, thank heavens, seldom killed by police gunfire in Ontario. Police know their primary responsibility is to preserve and protect life and that any use of force is only to ensure public safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police officer safety is essential to public safety. Ignoring a dangerous individual, allowing them, for example, to leave the area so as to avoid using deadly force, exposes the public at large to grave risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of anyone is a tragedy. The death of a citizen at the hands of police always warrants the fullest investigation. It may be that Toronto police did have alternatives and should have taken other steps. But such is not obvious from the video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are often accused of making a rush to judgment - in this case it may be that a rush to judgment is being made against the police. There will be an investigation and until then we should keep an open mind and accept the police may well have been justified in their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Morton is a lawyer and has argued for the justified use of force on many occasions. He is a past president of the Ontario Bar Association and practices in Ontario and Nunavut.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would be really alarming news but for the fact that Rayong's beaches are already so polluted that an oil spill will hardly be noticed. Mae Ramphung is the dumping ground for mountains of plastic bags, polystyrene, bottles, tins, cans, and detritus jettisoned by ships. I sometimes see the garbage trucks on the beach road, and would readily believe that they were making deliveries rather than collections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to this stinking mess, for the past three weeks the tides have been carrying in a brownish-green frothy slime that dries on the beach, leaving an odorous brown carpet. I do not know its origins or what it is, but suspect it is sewage effluent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your report quotes Puchong Sarittichaikul, director of a local marine-resources preservation centre, as saying that, with winds coming towards Rayong, he was &quot;concerned the slick could reach the beaches&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are the officials up in arms about an oil spill when for years they have blindly ignored the longer-term problem? Is it because this time they can point the finger at a corporate offender rather than their own mismanagement of Rayong's coastal resources?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;PM proposes reality show for brilliant beauties&quot;, July 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article says Prime Minister Yingluck wants to start a reality show to prove that smart women are beautiful. The winner will be crowned &quot;Smart Lady Thailand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am puzzled by the attempt to correlate brains with beauty. Beautiful women get more than enough attention in Thailand. It's time we paid some attention to the ugly ones. They are extremely disadvantaged, mainly because of the importance the Thai value system places on external appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer Steve Rosse observed long ago that there are so many beautiful women in Thailand that ugly women have a really tough time competing. It follows logically that it's the ugly women who must be smartest, because they have to work so hard to compete. My husband Horace says that if he were an employer, and he wanted to hire a woman to actually do some work rather than just serve as an office ornament, he'd hire an ugly one every time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, in our politically correct world, it would be hurtful to call ugly people &quot;ugly&quot;. We have to call them aesthetically challenged, looks-wise (ACL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I doubt the new reality show will ever get off the ground. It is basically a stupid idea. But this is Thailand, where stupid ideas often gain more traction than they would anywhere else. If the show does get off the ground, I suggest that, in the interests of fairness, all women should be eligible to compete whether beautiful or not. And winning ought to be based on brains, not beauty. But I know how far that idea will get in Thailand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrong to cite Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Latest cause: White rights&quot;, Letters, July 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who &quot;casually&quot; followed the fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin by George Zimmerman, I would like to point out a few undeniable facts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Bahrt was not present at the shooting scene. Only Zimmerman and the late Mr Martin were. So how could Mr Bahrt claim that he is &quot;100 per cent certain there was not one shred of evidence that Zimmerman, who was found &quot;not guilty&quot; by a racially mixed jury, committed any crime&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's death could have been avoided had Zimmerman not stepped out of his car to approach Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman is Hispanic, or at least multiracial, not white. Therefore, this case could never have been about &quot;white rights&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not Mr Zimmerman should have been found guilty is another story. But my point is, Mr Bahrt, that you can fight all you want for white rights. Just don't use this particular case to back your agenda.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Days after his administration filed suit against Texas to protect minority voters, President Obama told civil rights leaders and local officials on Monday that the federal government would vigorously enforce voting rights in the country despite a Supreme Court ruling against a core section of a landmark 1965 law, several participants said after a White House meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The president said that the Voting Rights Act is not dead, it's not even critical, it's just wounded,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist and MSNBC talk show host. ''He was very reassuring,'' Mr. Sharpton added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama met with the group for about 40 minutes, and administration officials led by the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., met with the group for a bit longer. The administration was addressing what Mr. Sharpton described as the civil rights community's ''alarm'' over the court's 5-to-4 vote last month. In that case, Shelby County v. Holder, the majority struck down as outdated and unnecessary the law's language requiring that the federal government review and clear any changes in election laws in nine states, most of them in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the meeting, the Obama administration reassured civil rights leaders last week with Mr. Holder's announcement that the Justice Department was asking a Texas federal court to require that state and local officials there get approval from the federal government for any changes in election law. The department's case is based on surviving provisions of the voting law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas' Republican leaders had said after the Supreme Court ruling that they would immediately put into effect new maps for electoral districts, which Latinos had challenged, as well as a new law requiring voters to show acceptable proof of identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama also said that he would seek bipartisan support for legislation reversing the impact of the court's decision, but participants were skeptical that he could prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House meeting, however, provided ''more than reassurance,'' said State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus in the Texas Legislature in Austin. The president and his team, he said, conducted ''an actual practical discussion about where are we going to go,'' and made clear that ''we're not going to wait for the Congress to act, we know there are some things we can start doing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, a dozen civil rights leaders and five elected officials from Texas, Florida, Georgia and Alabama attended the White House meeting. Others included Kasim Reed, the mayor of Atlanta; Janet Murgu&iacute;a, president of NCLR, also known as the National Council of La Raza, a prominent Hispanic rights advocacy organization; Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League; Margaret Fung, executive director of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund; and Roslyn Brock, board chairman of the N.A.A.C.P.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton said that there was no discussion of whether the Justice Department would prosecute George Zimmerman on civil rights charges in the killing of Trayvon Martin. The attendees also did not press Mr. Obama against nominating Raymond W. Kelly, New York City's police commissioner, to become secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Civil rights groups oppose Mr. Kelly, who has overseen an aggressive stop-and-frisk program that has mostly affected black and Latino men in New York.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William C. Thompson Jr. stood in front of City Hall on Monday flanked by two elected officials, both of them pastors. One by one, each called for New York State to stop prosecuting nonviolent 16- and 17-year-olds as adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two miles uptown, Bill de Blasio accepted the endorsement of a tenants' advocacy group. Outside the Stuyvesant Town apartment complex, he vowed to go to Albany and lobby for the repeal of a law that effectively took control of rent regulation out of the city's hands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid mounting calls for Anthony D. Weiner to drop out of the race for mayor over his lewd online exchanges with women, Mr. Thompson and Mr. de Blasio are trying to seize an opening: to be the alternative to Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who is once again seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new poll released by Quinnipiac University on Monday suggested that as Mr. Weiner's standing had been eroded by scandal, Mr. Thompson, a former city comptroller, and Mr. de Blasio, the public advocate, had leapt past him and were now neck-and-neck behind Ms. Quinn. The primary will be held on Sept. 10, and a runoff will follow on Oct. 1 if no candidate receives 40 percent or more of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll, which was conducted from last Wednesday to Sunday, found Ms. Quinn with the support of 27 percent of likely Democratic voters. She was followed by Mr. de Blasio with 21 percent, Mr. Thompson with 20 percent and Mr. Weiner with 16 percent. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, in the midday heat, Mr. Thompson and Mr. de Blasio held bread-and-butter campaign events aimed at important bases of support -- for Mr. Thompson, minority voters, and for Mr. de Blasio, middle-class liberals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson's appearance came a day after he delivered a forceful speech in which he criticized the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy, asserting that the city's policing tactics were rooted in the same racial stereotyping that had led George Zimmerman to confront Trayvon Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson was flanked by Councilman Fernando Cabrera, a Bronx Democrat, and Assemblyman Karim Camara, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the pastor of the church at which Mr. Thompson delivered his head-turning speech on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Today I feel compelled to speak in the same vein, because the rules of our criminal justice system are failing young people and families, especially in our communities of color,'' Mr. Thompson said before lamenting that New York and North Carolina are the only states that treat 16-year-old defendants as adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the same time, Mr. de Blasio received the endorsement of Tenants PAC, a group that works to elect candidates who will fight rent increases and preserve the supply of rent-stabilized and rent-controlled housing. Standing on the corner of 16th Street and First Avenue, Mr. de Blasio said that under his mayoralty, every major development would be required to have affordable housing on or near the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Last time I checked, it wasn't the real estate industry's town, and we were just living in it,'' Mr. de Blasio said, in remarks punctuated by applause and shouts of ''That's right!'' from the two dozen tenants gathered, who were holding ''De Blasio for Mayor'' signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, Mr. de Blasio had been in Brooklyn, where he put forth a plan to coordinate spending among small Brooklyn hospitals, in order to save the financially troubled Long Island College Hospital, which has been scheduled to close. At the tenants' event, he brought up that fight to take a veiled dig at Ms. Quinn, whom some downtown residents accuse of not doing enough to save St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan in Greenwich Village. The hospital closed in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We lost health care, we got condos,'' he said. ''That's not the future of this city.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview later on Monday, Mr. de Blasio said that he believed the race was now wide open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People are just beginning to focus,'' he said. ''It's anybody guess right now which combination of candidates will be in the runoff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Weiner, campaigning in Queens, dismissed calls from prominent Democrats and newspaper editorial boards that he drop out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am going to leave this decision to the people of the city of New York, period -- end of conversation,'' Mr. Weiner, a former congressman, told reporters outside a senior center. ''It's their decision. It's not yours. It's not mine. It's not some Sunday talk show pundit's.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his campaign in critical condition, Mr. Weiner affirmed his outsider status in a fund-raising letter to supporters on Monday, with the subject line, ''I'll let you decide.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''A lot of people who don't have a vote want to decide who our next mayor will be,'' Mr. Weiner wrote. ''They've all made up their minds that they want to stop our campaign right now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Quinnipiac Poll suggested that likely Democratic voters had also soured on his candidacy: 53 percent said he should drop out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who has stayed out of the mayoral race, said on Monday that he would not join the chorus of Democrats asking Mr. Weiner to drop out. He said it was not his place to say who should or should not run for office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when asked about Mr. Weiner's candidacy, Mr. Cuomo was not encouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is summer political theater in New York,'' he told reporters on Long Island. ''We laugh, because if we didn't laugh, we would cry.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former city Comptroller William Thompson's little-engine-that-could mayoral campaign took a turn for the truly ugly over the weekend, when the candidate stood up in a predominately black church in Brooklyn and grossly slandered the NYPD. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seeking to turn a profit from the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman tragedy, Thompson laid it on as thick as it comes:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Here in New York City, we have institutionalized Mr. Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to [profile] young black and Latino men . . . as Trayvon was profiled,&quot; he said - leaving hanging in the air the logical concluding clause: And then murdered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson is so wrong on so many different levels that it's difficult to know where to begin, but here are two questions: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Will Thompson ever again be able to look Police Commissioner Ray Kelly in the eye? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Why in the world would he say such a thing? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first question is personal; it's a test of character for Thompson. But the answer to No. 2 is as clear as a mountain spring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday's Quinnipiac University mayoral poll is the second in a row to show Thompson, who is African-American, well positioned to win a Democratic primary-election runoff in October. But first he must get in the runoff, and the polls also show him lagging badly among black voters (to the benefit, oddly enough, of cyber-flasher Anthony Weiner). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, what to do? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, wave the bloody shirt, of course. That is, recast a tragedy as a martyrdom, regardless of the damage that will do to the truth, to social harmony in New York and to Thompson's ability to govern should he in fact become mayor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson apparently feels the need to get beyond his earlier measured support for a muscular NYPD anti-crime presence in high-crime police precincts - a presence that has prompted the hopelessly politicized attack on cops' use of &quot;stop, question and frisk&quot; tactics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, Thompson even had pushed back against the standard left-wing demand for an independent inspector general for the NYPD and similar initiatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No doubt this was largely coalition-building - middle-class voters strongly support stop-and-frisk, for example - but there also was a detectable measure of sincerity in his rationale: &quot;I'm the one who has to worry about my son being stopped and frisked,&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm worried also about my son being shot by someone who's a member of a gang in the street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And worry he should, given the statistics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But black voters - Thompson's natural base - strongly oppose the program, and the always-odious Al Sharpton seems to have conditioned his own support for Thompson on unequivocal opposition to it: &quot;This is not a marginal issue,&quot; threatens The Rev. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thus the shameful Kelly-as-Zimmerman analogy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, while dramatic, it's probably not enough to please Sharpton. His continuing influence depends largely on his ability to keep supplicants dancing in public - so doubtless he's planning further humiliations for Thompson's immediate future. Just to make clear who's boss. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What adjustments will then be required of the candidate's carefully crafted campaign isn't clear. But in a race as close as this one - yesterday's Q-poll shows a statistical three-way dead heat, with Weiner a pile of smoldering wreckage - even subtle shifts could be critical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson has been chugging along in characteristically low-key fashion for some months now - quietly constructing alliances based on decades of personal connections and political give and take.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How much give, and how much take, remains to be seen; one shudders to think of what went in to Thompson's endorsement by the always-grasping teachers union, for example. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet, for better or for worse, that's how we govern ourselves. And Thompson's opponents appear prepared to turn the entire city over to the grabbers; better that half a loaf be stolen than the entire breadbasket, right? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Up to a point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To play retail politics with people's lives - and that's precisely what Thompson did Sunday - should be impermissible.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To so cynically delegitimize the world's finest urban police department - to cast 35,000 cops as reckless racial-profilers capable of murderous violence - is a grave offense to the NYPD.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, more important, to the citizens of New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Remember Crown Heights? It was a long time ago, but the same issue - contempt for public order - was in play then as it is now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Does Bill Thompson understand that's where he's headed? Does he even care? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time for some deep soul-searching. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayoral candidate Bill Thompson's harsher stance on the NYPD's use of stop-and-frisk is a calculated move to garner support from black and Latino voters, critics charge.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The former city comptroller, who on Sunday likened racial profiling in the Trayvon Martin killing to police profiling of citizens here, had until recently embraced a middle-of-the-road stance on the controversial NYPD tactic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a number of polls have shown Thompson struggling to cement the support of black voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think he originally felt that certain segments of the population were going to go with him automatically. He started looking at polls and seeing that wasn't happening,&quot; said City Councilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn), the lead sponsor of two bills that are meant to combat the high numbers of stops of black and Latino citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thompson has been criticized for not supporting either bill - including one that would create an inspector general to monitor the NYPD.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think Thompson's trying to have it both ways without putting any skin in the game,&quot; added Wil&shy;liams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of Thompson's opponents in the race for mayor also accused him of flip-flopping on the issue for political gain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Cut the bull, Bill,&quot; said former City Council member and mayoral hopeful Sal Albanese, who called on Thompson to apologize for being overly critical of the city's police force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Since this campaign started, Bill Thompson has made it his business to try to be all things to all people,&quot; he added. &quot;New Yorkers can see right through his pandering.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Throughout the campaign, Thompson has called stop-and- frisk a useful tool but one that has been &quot;abused&quot; and &quot;misused.&quot; He said that, rather than creating legislation to improve the police tactic, all it would take is a change of mayors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, he said, &quot;If our government profiles people because of skin color and treats them as potential criminals, how can we expect citizens to do any less?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday, Thompson insisted his stance on the issue hasn't changed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My position on stop-and-frisk still is the same. It is of continual concern about that,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has yet to endorse a candidate in the mayor's race, said the speech made him go from &quot;disappointed&quot; to &quot;encouraged&quot; regarding Thompson's stance on stop-and-frisk. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I thought it was clearly something that will probably energize a lot of voters who have questions about the fairness of the criminal justice system and policing,&quot; he told The Post. &quot;I think it could prove to energize a lot of voters in the black and Latino community who have been waiting to see where Mr. Thompson stood.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective union President Mike Palladino, who also heads a coalition of uniformed employees that endorsed Thompson, said his latest comments about stop-and-frisk wouldn't impact their backing. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former city comptroller and current mayoral candidate William Thompson is a reasonable person with a solid record. On the campaign trail, he has avoided egregious demagoguery-unlike, say, his rival John Liu-and has played down his role as the sole African-American in the multi-candidate mayoral race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So after Mr. Thompson delivered a stinging condemnation of the Police Department the other day, attention must be paid. Speaking at a predominately black church in Brooklyn, Mr. Thompson lashed out at the NYPD's stop and frisk policy and suggested that the department's higher-ups have &quot;institutionalized&quot; the sort of profiling that led to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Mr. Liu and others, Mr. Thompson has never demanded an end to stop and frisk, although he has been critical of the policy. His reasonable position on the issue has been ratified by the likes of former Mayor David Dinkins and Congressman Charles Rangel, who recently asked, &quot;Do you want people carrying guns in your community illegally that could do bodily harm? The answer is: hell, no!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These prominent African-American leaders know that stop and frisk has helped reduce the city's murder rate to historic lows, which means that it has saved the lives of hundreds of black and Latino New Yorkers who live in high-crime areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That makes Mr. Thompson's apparent change of heart-and his charged language-all the more disconcerting. He insisted that black and Latino New Yorkers are being &quot;profiled as Trayvon was profiled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If our government profiles people because of skin color and treats them as potential criminals, how can we expect citizens to do any less?&quot; Mr. Thompson asked. That line of argument comes perilously close to blaming Martin's death on the NYPD-and that's not an argument any would-be mayor ought to be making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's possible that Mr. Thompson is simply trying to rally his supporters as we head into the final full month of the primary campaign. It's possible that he took to heart the criticism of the Rev. Al Sharpton, who insisted that it was not &quot;wise&quot; of Mr. Thompson to defend any aspect of stop and frisk because, the reverend argued, &quot;it is a policy that is based on racial profiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sharpton specializes in incendiary language. Mr. Thompson does not. Hopefully Mr. Thompson will revert to form when stop and frisk comes up for discussion in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The music titans eschew flashy theatrics in Pasadena for hits, hits and more hits, expertly executed. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once you get over the sheer enormity of it all - the sleek but giant cherry-red stage flanked by proportionally huge screens, the sprawling band (20 strong at least, and roaring), not to mention the crater-like landmark this show filled Sunday night - you come to realize something else unusual about Justin Timberlake &amp; Jay Z's modernist stadium spectacle: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing much happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will sound crazy to any of the estimated 65,000 who turned out for this mega-party, hosted by two justly dubbed Legends of the Summer. Your co-workers who scored floor seats - and managed to get through hourlong waits at mobbed wristband check-in tents before show time - are likely still annoying the office with breathlessly overcome stories of how great it was, undoubtedly mixed with frustration over the hyper-clustered Rose Bowl experience in general. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How could they not keep buzzing off such an astonishing parade of hits and more hits, all smoothly sequenced and impressively performed by two titans - the most godfather-like mogul in the rap game and the most multifaceted pop superstar of the past decade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone there must have come away with a special moment. My turntable is currently spinning Side 1 of JT's &quot;20/20&quot; opus, the biggest-selling album of the year so far, over and over, because for me there was no finer, more supremely Princely moment than the sumptuously funky &quot;Pusher Love Girl.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In those seven, eight minutes (so riveting it felt like three) Timberlake took complete command of the band, simmering through the first half of its seductively lurching groove while letting his remarkably powerful falsetto rise and rise. Then, after quickly bringing the house down by halting the song and gazing out at the masses with an impossibly perfect grin, he really let it all hang out on the reprise, becoming a j-j-j-j-junkie for your love jamming through a narcotic-erotic swerve, strutting to a stage-singeing stomp and wailing sweet nothings into the night sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potent stuff, and it has only whetted my appetite for the fuller Timberlake arena encounters that were announced the morning after the big bash, Nov. 26 at Staples Center and Nov. 27 at Honda Center, on sale Aug. 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then I peruse the set list again and remember so many other highlights. Like how the crowd, ignited from the start, went bananas in a hurry when pseudo-ominous opening piece &quot;Holy Grail&quot; yielded to a set-it-off run. First came Jay's &quot;I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me),&quot; with JT perfectly supplying Pharrell Williams' parts, then Justin's &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; (even more Daft Punkish than before) and straight into a snippet of the Jackson 5's &quot;I Want You Back,&quot; followed by the smash that samples it, &quot;Izzo (H.O.V.A.).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or how about &quot;99 Problems,&quot; with JT ham-fisting its basic riff on a clear guitar before mixing in Aerosmith's &quot;Walk This Way&quot; squiggle, then sassing up the cop's lines in the second set of verses? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timberlake had a wealth of adoringly received numbers. Some were club bangers; he even brought &quot;SexyBack,&quot; replete with Timbaland assist. Others were churning midtempo climaxes (&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; and &quot;What Goes Around ... Comes Around&quot; most explosive of all). Then there's old-school slow jam &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; and his growing list of Michael Jackson-worthy anthems, like &quot;Mirrors&quot; and the new '80s disco cut &quot;Take Back the Night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what of Jay's many standout turns? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, he's been getting a fair amount of flak for sounding out of touch on his month-old chart-topping album &quot;Magna Carta ... Holy Grail&quot; - wedded bliss doesn't make for lively or even believable rap. But he was still fierce here on &quot;Public Service Announcement,&quot; &quot;Dirt Off Your Shoulder&quot; and &quot;Encore.&quot; He remains endearingly playful on &quot;Jigga What, Jigga Who,&quot; and was even more so during his parts of &quot;Suit &amp; Tie.&quot; And he was inspiring on &quot;Empire State of Mind,&quot; even with Alicia Keys missing, and &quot;Heart of the City (Ain't No Love),&quot; with a rest-in-peace aside for Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland offered from JT. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, Jay stayed on pace as an infallibly sharp rhymer (even while his subject matter loses appeal) with the fresh track &quot;Tom Ford.&quot; If he's coasting a little by rapping about Basquiats and Bugattis, well, he's earned that choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, the duo dished out 36 songs in 2&frac12; hours and still had gems left in the tank (they've done &quot;Frontin' &quot; and &quot;Clique&quot; elsewhere). Plus, toward the end of the performance, Timberlake, looking vaudeville-dapper in black and white and bowler hat, crooned &quot;New York, New York&quot; alone in a side-stage spotlight, as an intro to &quot;Empire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can I possibly say nothing happens?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because by current concert standards, this Legends of the Summer show is noticeably minimalist. JT and JZ - along with Kanye West, the new dark lord of toweringly empty spaces on stage - represent the new live retro-modern. They're certainly capable of indulging extra effects - Timberlake's solo tour should be radically different, seeing as his &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds&quot; outing was an advanced sprawl like no other. But they tend not to go for obvious constructs and gimmicks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no extended runway into the crowd here, for instance, as at virtually every event anymore. No pyrotechnics, either, unless you count a few fiery video blasts, and really no choreography, apart from a few entrance cues. Sure, Justin busts plenty of moves - popping and locking out of nowhere, sizzling James Brown-style throughout &quot;My Love,&quot; soft-shoe-ing it amid &quot;Suit &amp; Tie.&quot; Yet by and large those seemed like spontaneous and instinctive reactions to what he's feeling from the music, not preplanned pivots and twists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, this Rose Bowl bonanza was more like a straight-up hip-hop show or hard-hitting classic-rock blast - in your face, all the time - than it was a thematically orchestrated presentation, as everyone from Beyonc&eacute; to Bieber and Usher to Gaga offers these days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, it was segmented. Party-launching medleys followed by individual showcases, with Timberlake getting more exposure of new material - and more time overall - than his partner. Ultimately a big finish: &quot;Young Forever,&quot; now a cellphone-hoisting tribute to Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it all came rushing out in a mighty barrage, one crowd-freaking moment after another, until the whole thing blurred. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isn't that still the best way to thrill people? Sure seemed like it Sunday. <BR><BR><BR><BR>bwener@ocregister.com </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Demonstrators in Irvine aim to keep teenager's death in the spotlight. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Joseph White and his wife, Lois, of Irvine were on their way home Sunday evening when they saw a rally near their house in the Woodbridge neighborhood. They parked their car and joined in.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally to protest the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman and racial discrimination in general brought out about 75 people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White, a retired psychology professor at UC Irvine, said he'd never seen such a crowd gathered to protest in his neighborhood, which he said has only a tiny proportion of African Americans like himself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm just amazed,&quot; White said. &quot;This shows me that there is a conscience in America that is sometimes not very visible&quot; that is concerned with ending racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was one of several in Orange County since the July 13 acquittal of Zimmerman, charged in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot and killed Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old African American youth, in February 2012 in Florida. Zimmerman said he shot in self-defense after struggling with Martin, but a delayed arrest and the eventual verdict have triggered national protests asserting that racism and racial profiling have played a part in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it's been more than two weeks since the verdict, those gathered Sunday said it was important to keep the case alive and the discussions of racial profiling it has sparked. As the sun set, they gathered on a corner of Culver Drive and Alton Parkway and held signs, including &quot;No one's child is expendable!&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was organized through Facebook by the Irvine United Congregational Church and church member Felicity Figueroa. Figueroa said she organized the event after going to a rally in Santa Ana earlier this month, also to protest the Zimmerman acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It made me feel that going to one rally wasn't really going to do anything. ... (People) would just move on to the next news item, and that's not going to solve anything.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Figueroa said, she hopes the Sunday rally will encourage church members to take a role in ending racial profiling and keep the issue alive for the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church calls itself &quot;radically inclusive&quot; and participates in food drives, AIDS walks, peace vigils and other events as part of its social justice component, Figueroa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're doing right now is to spread the word and show solidarity with those around us. ... We are all the Martin family,&quot; said Paul Tellstr&ouml;m, the senior pastor of the church. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By doing these vigils ... we bring to the conscience of people that we have a long way to go before we can eradicate racism or prejudice of any kind.&quot; <BR><BR><BR><BR>aboessenkool@ocregister.com </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI BEACH </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the National Bar Association, the largest organization of African-American attorneys in the U.S., on Monday joined a chorus of black leaders nationwide in warning Florida that it could face a boycott if it does not repeal or amend its &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Page told a press conference at the organization's national convention that, if he could speak to Florida's Gov. Rick Scott, he would tell him that a boycott is a possibility though not his preference. He said he would prefer to see Florida agree to a special session of the Legislature to discuss changing the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Page also directed remarks at state Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, a principal author of the stand your ground law in Florida. Baxley recently told National Public Radio that the law had been written in part to allow tourists to protect themselves and for that reason a boycott made no sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Page said he doesn't see it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Representative Baxley, Governor Scott, this is the truth,&quot; Page said: &quot;Your state will begin to be impacted in its tourism unless you act. Listen to the whispers before they become screams. Tourism, which is one of the lifelines of this state, would be impacted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Page pointed out that Baxley, in his professional life, is a mortician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a way to drum up business,&quot; he said of Baxley's authorship of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders in Florida have asked Scott to convene a special session to discuss repealing or amending stand your ground. Scott has refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott's office in Tallahassee has been the site of a sit-in for the past two weeks by opponents of stand your ground, who call themselves the Dream Defenders. Veteran civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who attended the attorneys conference Monday, said he was leaving for Tallahassee to show his support for the protesters. Last week they were joined by singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Nice&shy;ville, said Monday he agrees with Scott that there is no need for a special session. Gaetz said there is little agreement on whether change is needed to the law and that voters have a chance in the 2014 elections to make their views known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If people want to change the policymakers, if they want to change the policies, that's why we have elections,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Page urged voters to go to the polls next year to remove lawmakers who back stand your ground, but he also renewed the call for a special session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now we're trying to change the law and have a common-sense dialogue with those who want to have dialogue,&quot; he said. &quot;What I'm saying is clear: Boycott if we must. But right now we're asking you just to talk to us. We're asking you to convene a Legislature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton of Miami Gardens, mother of Trayvon Martin, also spoke at the news conference. Her unarmed African-American son, 17, was shot to death in February 2012 in the Central Florida town of Sanford by George Zimmerman, 28, who is part white, part Hispanic. Zimmerman contended he was defending himself when the two struggled. The judge in his homicide trial used the stand your ground law as part of her jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted July 13. The case had touched off a nationwide debate on stand your ground laws, a debate that has only intensified since the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks entertainers such as Stevie Wonder and Madonna have said they will not perform in Florida while stand your ground is law. Martin Luther King III called for a boycott of Florida orange juice and social media have erupted with calls for a wider economic boycott of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton was asked if she would support a boycott of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't say I'm in support of it or not in support of ,&quot; she said. &quot;But people have a right to free speech and if that is their way of showing how they feel, to express themselves about the verdict, I think that's something that they can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also voiced support for repealing stand your ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it assisted the person who killed my son to get away with murder,&quot; she said of the law. &quot;I think we have to change these laws for people to not get away with murder. We have to change these laws so that it doesn't happen to somebody else's child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also present were Cleopatra and Nathaniel Pendleton, a Chicago couple whose daughter Hadiya, 15, died in a drive-by shooting in Chicago about a week after she performed in Washington at an event surrounding the presidential inauguration. The couple was at the convention, in part to participate in a panel about gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulton's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said he is afraid that if stand your ground laws aren't repealed, a legal precedent will be set allowing other cases to be decided in the way that the Zimmerman case was decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot have that precedent set,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crump said he believes that the controversial law should not be called stand your ground, because that makes the person invoking it sound noble and strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we should call it is really what it is: the 'make my day' law,&quot; Crump said, quoting the famous line from the 1971 film &quot;Dirty Harry,&quot; in which Clint Eastwood played a trigger-happy police inspector.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism learned, it is not inborn </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Arteman (&quot;Racism perpetuated by people, government,&quot; July 25) wrote against the demonstrations and demand for justice for Trayvon Martin. He wrote juries are for determining who is guilty and judges are to determine the punishment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges and juries are people, and are wrong, too. Innocent people are found guilty and the guilty go free quite often.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even today, men and women are imprisoned for their race or because the judge and jury for whatever reason didn't believe their story. Mr. Arteman said the citizens and government of this nation need to quit allowing &quot;special&quot; treatment for race, nationality or religion, but we have freedom for that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all have a different view of freedoms. But each of us should own our heritage, including you. You call it &quot;hyphenated&quot; when your race is put before &quot;American&quot; - German-American, Japanese-American, African-American. It has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with heritage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism won't end until it's stopped being taught. We are not born with those negative qualities, we are taught them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was born in the South. My parents walked the fields hand-picking cotton. My grandparents were the offspring of slaves - actually owned by white folk. Although I personally endured the racism of the 1950s and 1960s of people like Gov. George Wallace and Sen. Strom Thurmon, I'm not a racist. I wasn't taught that way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I differ totally in Mr. Arteman's view on justice and racism. I actually think white Americans started it and white America must end it. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomington </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flat tax unfairto the poor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's news had a statement concerning changing Illinois tax laws, suggesting a flat tax would be more equitable. Such a person should try to live on a small income and meet the current regressive taxes in Illinois. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately 3.56 million households in the U.S. have household incomes of less than $5,000 a year. Fifty percent of the U.S. households have less than about $47,000 per year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Households in lower income brackets pay the same gasoline tax as those in the highest brackets. They pay the same 1 percent tax on food. Auto registration fees are the same for used cars as for Caddys and BMWs. They do not have enough income to buy pensions or take care of medical emergencies or education. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals promoting a flat tax should try to live on $92 a week. This has to include housing, clothing, food and the sales taxes we charge on their purchases. Members of the Legislature should live for a month every year on less than $400. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been reported that there are over 100 households in Illinois with wealth assets greater than $1 billion. A flat tax on them? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to know why we don't get industry to move to Illinois, consider the median incomes and their educational attainments. Education costs but it is an investment in the future of the state. There is no evidence that supports an increase in the economy by lower taxes on the wealthy. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our state is in financial shambles. Illinois' credit rating is in the toilet. Our roads, highways and bridges are crumbling around us. Yet, our elected representatives find the time and the dollars to take junkets to Turkey and China. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, we're poised to spend $71 million on land and untold millions more to build a third airport (the need for which is debatable at best) in the Chicago area. It is unbelievable and totally absurd! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're all being dragged down the &quot;rabbit hole&quot; of our state government, and Club &quot;Nero&quot; fiddles while Illinois burns! </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PEOPLE IN Point Breeze - hell, people all over - are tired of living with violence, tired of milling around at vigils, tired of wondering when things will change for the better. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's Anton Moore's theory, anyway. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And judging by the scores of people who crowded into Wharton Square Park last night, Moore is on to something. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unity in the Community, a local nonprofit that Moore, 27, founded four years ago, held a packed peace rally in the park as part of the organization's second annual Peace Week festivities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last night's rally, which was attended by a number of local pols - including state Sen. Anthony Williams, City Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and state Reps. Jordan Harris and Brian Sims - ended with a boisterous march from Wharton Square, at 24th and Reed streets, to Stinger Square Park, at 32nd and Reed in Grays Ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People are tired of being tired. They want something to happen; they want kids to have a safe place to grow up,&quot; Moore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this year, he received a $10,000 grant from the Philly chapter of Black Male Engagement (BMe), which is supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moore said he put the money toward adding more entertainment and events to Peace Week, which tonight will include a party for teens hosted by Power 99 FM at the Dixon House on 20th Street near Mifflin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other events this week will include a peace conference and a college-readiness seminar for local youth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everybody wants peace,&quot; Moore said. &quot;It's not just an African-American thing. It's a white thing, a Hispanic thing. Nobody wants to get shot!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ajor Brown, of 20th and Christian streets, said she found out about the peace rally from a church mailing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I sent an email to all of my friends to see if they would want to get involved in light of the Trayvon Martin case,&quot; said Brown, 32. &quot;I said, 'This is where the rubber meets the road. This is where we can start to make a difference in our community.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown said the show of neighborhood unity was long overdue. &quot;I'm glad the community is coming out and supporting [Anton].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson noted that he regularly turned up at Wharton Square Park as a teen for vigils in memory of youths who had died from gun violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I want to put a challenge to every young man that's here today,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;We have a responsibility to make sure that we are strong role models for these young people that are here. If we don't guide them, the streets will.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEAR HARRIETTE: I feel like everybody is up in arms over the George Zimmerman trial and the fact that he was acquitted. People in my neighborhood are talking about it - screaming about it, really. At work, it is hard to concentrate because so many people are voicing their opinions. It is a little uncomfortable because for the most part, the opinions fall along racial lines. The white people favor Zimmerman, and the black people favor Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Not all, but many. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am black, and I have a black son. I am really worried for him. I don't want to be paranoid, but it bothers me a lot that this man killed a black teenager and got away with it. How can I share my opinions, keep my son safe and not get into a heated argument at work? - Overwhelmed by the News, Shreveport, La.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEAR OVERWHELMED BY THE NEWS: The George Zimmerman case has awakened many people in our country to some of the deep disparities in thought and law that exist here. Yes, many argue along racial lines, but not everyone. Just witness the huge peaceful rallies that have been conducted across the country. If you look at the faces, they reflect every color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At work, I would suggest that do your job. Choose to work rather than get into a heated discussion about a topic that, in some ways, is beyond your reach. You can say to your co-workers that you, too, are passionate about this subject, but you are also committed to doing your job. Right now you must focus your attention on that. Apart from work, decide if you want to participate in the many rallies that are being organized or in other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For your son, unfortunately, you do need to teach him to be extremely careful when he is approached by police officers and random others. It is frightening to realize that many young black men are unsafe as soon as they walk outside their doors. But across the country, this is too often true. There have been multiple news reports in the past few days where wealthy, well-educated, well-dressed black men have been pulled over by the police and questioned and arrested for no legitimate reason. And this is when the confrontation is with the law. When the challenge comes from a random citizen, it is even more frightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because this is true, you need to prepare your son to protect himself - hopefully without instilling too much fear in him in the process. There are no easy answers to this cultural crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can choose to engage your member of Congress about how to create more protective laws. You can participate in cultural dialogue about this topic - outside of your workplace. You can follow what Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents are doing to attempt to protect young people against the violence that killed their son. To learn more, visit trayvonmartinfoundation.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am concerned about the recent portrayal of the BART negotiations. In the past week, two articles have seemed to belong in the opinion pages or should have been labeled as an &quot;in-depth&quot; series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You should be covering how unions are the last bulkhead in a fight against the middle class by the privileged few. And I am one of the &quot;privileged few.&quot; I make substantially more than the $76,551 gross pay for BART workers. Yet I am here to fight with them. They should get cost-of-living adjustments. They can give a little on pensions/medical -- they should contribute like the rest of us do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when Wisconsin and Texas governors attack unions and bolster right-to-work laws, the Mercury News should be informing Californians about attempts to strip the rights, incomes and benefits of our hardworking neighbors who help keep the demand for fossil fuels in check.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palo Alto</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fire striking BART employees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If BART workers strike again, Gov. Jerry Brown should &quot;do a Reagan&quot; -- declare a state of emergency and terminate employees who don't show up for work. Tear up contracts and redefine salary and benefits to a rational level. Call in the National Guard to run BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this be inconvenient for passengers? Only temporarily. There are plenty of people willing to take BART employees' places. In 45 to 60 days, the negative impact will be nil, but the future will look promising, including a financially strong BART and a willing employee workforce. It worked with air traffic controllers and it will work with BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Brown, where do you really stand? The bloated gravy train has to stop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 50 years after women's liberation, sexual harassment in the workplace remains a serious issue, from outright assault in the military to the roaming paws of sexual predators like San Diego Mayor Bob Filner. Is this really what we want for our daughters today -- another establishment that treats women as baubles who exist only for the pleasure of men? I'm all for growing the economy, but downtown needs an &quot;upscale&quot; bikini bar like it needs another dot-com bust.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The op-ed by President Barack Obama (&quot;America must fix what ails the middle class,&quot; July 29) is truly sad. Exploiting a dubious record, the president's only plan is once again to hit the campaign trail to deliver the same tired ideas of overspending and increased entitlements. He will have us ignore what he calls &quot;phony scandals&quot; at the IRS and the Department of Justice while allowing the NSA to threaten our liberty. What the country needs, Mr. President, is solid leadership, not another speaking tour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wayne Hathaway (Letters, July 27) writes that George Zimmerman might not be alive today if he hadn't carried his gun. If Zimmerman didn't have a gun, I strongly suspect he would not have engaged Trayvon Martin in the first place. But the extra bravado and Wild West mentality that comes from being in possession of a weapon that easily can kill apparently provided the extra impulse to be a vigilante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if Martin also had had a gun? Maybe we would have had a shootout. Americans' fetish for weapons will not, contrary to the NRA's incessant blather, result in a more law-abiding society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While protesters continued to occupy the first floor of the Capitol Monday, Senate President Don Gaetz said he does not see any reason to call a special session to address some of the issues raised by the activists after the outcome of the George Zimmerman trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I stand with Gov. Scott and I stand with Speaker Weatherford,&quot; Gaetz said, referring to the two other state leaders who have rejected a call for a special session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters want lawmakers to use the special session to review the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense law, racial profiling and the disciplinary treatment of minority youth in Florida schools. The protest began shortly after a jury found Zimmerman not guilty of shooting Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gaetz, R-Niceville, who has the power to call a special session by joint agreement with the House speaker, said no one has advanced any specific plans for a session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you call a special session of the Legislature when you have a landing zone that is agreed upon on an issue,&quot; Gaetz said. &quot;You don't call a special session, I don't think, and just bring 160 politicians to town and just turn them loose and hope it all works out. I don't think that's the right thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted no legislation has thus far been filed. &quot;I'm not sure what a special session would accomplish,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaetz said he could &quot;sympathize&quot; with the frustration of the protesters, while also noting the Zimmerman trial ended with a decision by the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who are protesting are exercising their rights as Americans just as those who served on the jury exercised their responsibilities as a jury of peers,&quot; Gaetz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gaetz also acknowledged there is a provision in the state constitution that would allow a special session to be called without approval by the Senate president, House speaker or governor. It would require a petition from 20 percent of the House and Senate members and then approved by three-fifths of the overall membership. Gaetz said the procedure has never been successfully invoked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take the IRS scandal or Benghazi, for example.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not much happens in this country anymore that someone or group will find reason to protest. This is especially true when prominent people (such as our president) goad them on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In my view, Barack Obama added fuel to a highly explosive situation by comparing himself to Trayvon Martin and saying, &quot;This could have been me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Did he not realize the impact such a statement would have on others, or was this his intention?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'll be the last one to say our judicial system is always right or fair, but it's one of the things our nation was founded upon. Included is the right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Zimmerman had his trial by jury and was found not guilty. Whether we agree or not, it was a jury decision. We live with it, and God willing we will move on.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Findley's praise for the &quot;in your face&quot; journalist, Helen Thomas (column last Thursday), helps assure her reputation as anti-Israeli, anti-Jewish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Thomas said the Jews should &quot;get the hell out of Palestine,&quot; she wasn't referring to settlements, she was targeting all the Jews in Israel. She said they should return to Germany and Poland. She was unconcerned that is where they were murdered by the millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Findley, like Thomas, criticized the war on terror from the anti-Jewish, anti-Israeli perspective. Thomas, with her partisan and confrontational journalism, was not a fair reporter but earned Findley's approval without doubt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first lessons in budgeting is to provide a small fund sufficient to pay for four to six weeks of fixed costs in the case of unexpected job loss, illness, or other interruption of income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given that our legislators seem not to have learned that lesson (as evidenced by the quick offer of &quot;payday loans&quot;) certainly illuminates a potential cause for the poor state of Illinois' budget in general and pension funds in particular.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sybrina Fulton repeated her assertion that neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder&quot; in the 2012 killing of her son largely because of Florida's self-defense law, which generally removed a person's duty to retreat if possible in the face of danger. It was the first of its kind in the nation when passed in 2005. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, about two dozen states have similar laws, but the focus of repeal efforts is squarely on Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to change the law so that this doesn't happen to someone else's child,&quot; Fulton told reporters at the National Bar Association's annual meeting. &quot;My son wasn't doing anything wrong. He was simply walking home. He wasn't a suspect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, has rejected calls for a special legislative session on &quot;stand your ground&quot; from protesters who have been occupying part of the Capitol in Tallahassee since Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month by a jury in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman claimed self-defense in shooting the 17-year-old Martin during a fight; Martin's supporters say Zimmerman profiled and followed him because Martin was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senate President Don Gaetz, also a Republican, said Monday he agrees with Scott that there is no need for a special session. G</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aetz said there is little agreement on whether change is needed to the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and that voters have a chance in the 2014 elections to make their views known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If people want to change the policymakers, if they want to change the policies, that's why we have elections,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the message of Monday's event was just that: urging people to register to vote and contribute to sympathetic politicians if they want such laws repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization's president, John Page, also said the legal system needs to do more to ensure that racially balanced juries are chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to raise our voices together and say, &amp;#8216;Enough,'&quot; Page said. &quot;This should be the first state where &amp;#8216;stand your ground' falls. And it will fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he was not part of the event, the Rev. Jesse Jackson appeared as a spectator and later told reporters that the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law reminded him of past laws that prevented blacks from sitting at the front of buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such an ordinance sparked the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955 that was key to the civil rights movement &amp;#8212; which did not focus just on the bus drivers, but on ending the law itself, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because Zimmerman's trial was not focused on race, Jackson added, it &quot;did not have a foundation based on reality. We're not looking for a fight. We're looking for a solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Justice Department is investigating whether Zimmerman, who identifies as Hispanic, may have committed a hate crime in killing Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal experts say it would be a difficult charge to bring because no evidence has surfaced indicating Zimmerman singled out Martin because he was black or that he harbored racial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Associated Press writer Gary Fineout in Tallahassee contributed to this story.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI BEACH, Fla. | Backlash from the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin echoed across Florida on Monday with a call from the leader of a black lawyers' organization to repeal the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law or face a possible economic boycott. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are asking the Legislature to turn the pain that parents are feeling into a simple plan - so that our youth will come home every night,&quot; said John Page, president of the National Bar Association, an organization that represents African-American lawyers and judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing beside Page during a news conference at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach was Sybrina Fulton, mother of the 17-year-old Miami Gardens youth who was killed by Zimmerman in Sanford in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing about this law is (that) I think it assisted the person who killed my son to get away with murder,&quot; Fulton said. &quot;That has to change. We have to change these laws so it doesn't happen to someone else's child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the law is not scrapped or amended, said Page, &quot;Tourism, one of the lifelines of the state, will be impacted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau, said a proposed boycott &quot;just doesn't make sense. The first line of damage is to African-American-owned businesses who are sharing in the profitability of tourism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was charged with second-degree murder in Martin's death. His July 13 acquittal sparked outrage and expressions of dismay from many quarters, including the White House.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A Tampa native urges skateboarders, officials and residents to seek unity on the Bro Bowl.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Moses White had a dream. And a change of heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the Tampa native asked his friend Barbara Oguntade to speak on his behalf before a state review board looking at the historic value of the Bro Bowl in Perry Harvey Sr. Park in downtown Tampa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like several other black residents with strong ties to the area, he wanted to object to the nomination of the skateboarding basin to the National Register of Historic Places. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a more significant cultural history of blacks in Tampa and their contributions that supersede the Bro Bowl,&quot; White said in his statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel, however, voted to recommend including the Bro Bowl on the National Register, setting the stage for a final decision in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White, who now lives in Atlanta, went to sleep that night and had a dream in which his father, Moses White, a renowned Tampa businessman who died decades ago, spoke to him about the park. And he says his father's message was one that might upset other members of the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My father died 27 years ago, and he never came to me in a dream,&quot; says White, 68. &quot;So I have to share what my father told me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That message: &quot;This is a golden opportunity for people to come together - young, old, black, white. There has to be a way we can do this together. We can create a beautiful example of how to move forward without hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is especially important with everything that's happening now, with the Trayvon Martin case. ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bro Bowl's nomination has launched a divisive controversy pitting skateboarders against city officials and black residents who want to see the park honor a different history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bowl is on the site of the Central Avenue area, once a thriving center of the black community with a history that dates back to the Civil War. Plans call for the bowl to be demolished as part of a $6.5 million makeover of the park, which includes a history walk dedicated to the area's black community leaders and prominent citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White wants to help forge a compromise that addresses the past - the black history makers - and the future - the kids who skate in the area. He also sees a compromise as a way to educate inner-city youths about the rich history of African-Americans, stretching back to the freed slaves who settled there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White's father, Moses, was a renowned leader of Tampa's black community. He opened his first restaurant in 1932 on Central Avenue, and it became a popular hangout, serving Ray Charles and former Tampa Mayor Dick Greco. Moses White was also known for his help restoring peace during riots in 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White, who attended Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University and played for the Denver Broncos, says he was the first black player with the Cincinnati Bengals, and his last team was the San Diego Chargers, where he sustained a career-ending knee injury. White says his career included being a manager for Motown great Marvin Gaye, and he's now a retired businessman on the board of Wayfield Foods stores in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the park project includes federal money, Tampa officials will have to go through a process that evaluates the area for anything that might be considered historic. This process could have a bigger impact on the park renovations. During the process, the public is invited to discuss concerns and make suggestions about anything that might have a historical impact, including the bowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some options for the bowl, White said, might include painting the structure with scenes from African-American history relating to the area, placing plaques on benches where kids could read them and constructing sculptures and busts of leaders in highly visible places. He also talked about piping in the music of black musicians such as James Brown and Jackie Wilson, along with hip-hop music, and other options could include making changes to the bowl to make it more acceptable to the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a way that both sides can be comfortable if they use common sense,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked on Friday whether it's possible to look at plans for Perry Harvey Sr. Park in a way that honors both the African-American and skater historical narratives, Mayor Bob Buckhorn said, &quot;I think that will be part of the discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have an obligation to look at all options that we have available to us,&quot; said Buckhorn, who opposes putting the Bro Bowl on the National Register. &quot;That would not be the preferred option. I really, really don't think that this (state historic designation review board) recognized how insensitive that decision was to our African-American community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It would appear that this law tends to embolden those who carry weapons, legally or illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman knew he was armed; did Trayvon Martin have the same knowledge? If Zimmerman knew that he had a duty to retreat, would he have even followed Martin and engaged or stopped him? We'll never know, but the statistics do show an increasing homicide rate where these laws have been enacted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each time the Times writes an article on this subject, this is the message you give to your readers: &quot;St. Petersburg remains the only major Florida city not to offer routine curbside recycling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement implies a disregard for the environment, when in fact the Pinellas County Waste-to-Energy Facility here burns 85 percent of our trash and turns it into energy that powers the facility with the excess is sold to Duke Energy, which in turn powers 45,000 homes and businesses each day. Only 15 percent of our garbage goes to landfill.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I support President Barack Obama's recently announced plan to combat climate change and advance clean energy. The plan calls for reducing carbon pollution from power plants - our largest source of pollution driving climate change - which also harms our health and economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are already seeing the effects of climate change: Storms are becoming more intense, heat waves more severe, drought more persistent and wildfire more prevalent. Superstorm Sandy alone caused more than $1 billion in damages and a loss of life that cannot be quantified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising temperatures also trigger more bad-air days, which are of particular concern for the young, the elderly and those with asthma and other health issues. We can't afford to ignore these costs any longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investing in renewable energy, increased efficiency and pollution controls will create jobs and a more resilient economy. In fact, history has shown when we rein in pollution we get a big bang for our buck. Since 1970 every $1 in investment in compliance with Clean Air Act standards has produced $4 to $8 in economic benefits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has been attracting national attention in the wake of the July 13 acquittal of George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighborhood watchman, in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford on Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's case has shined a spotlight on the intersection of race on the criminal justice system and school discipline. (Martin was serving an out-of-school suspension when he was shot while walking to his father's home after buying Skittles and a drink.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 22, Florida's Secretary of the Department of Juvenile Justice, Wansley Walters, met with the Dream Defenders to talk about how to keep children out of the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida,&quot; said Monique Gillum, one of the leaders of Dream Defenders during the meeting. &quot;It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrest data on Florida students</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To back up her claim, Gillum pointed to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice report that states that 12,520 youth were arrested for school-related arrests during the 2011-12 year. (School-related includes arrests at school, the bus or bus stop, and school-sponsored events.) About two-thirds were for misdemeanors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department pointed us to the same report to show that the number of youth school-related arrests have declined 48 percent since the 2004-05 school year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason for the decline is that the majority of Florida school districts have started using civil citations for non-violent misdemeanors. The citations include penalties such as community service. If the student complies, no arrest goes on their record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being arrested at school can be traumatic. Even if the arrest doesn't ultimately lead to a conviction, it can still hurt students because they may have to disclose it on job or college applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Miami-Dade school district, the largest in the state and the one where Martin was a student, was the first to implement civil citations -- and that could be why it had far fewer arrests than several smaller districts. (Walters was at the Miami-Dade County Juvenile Services Department at the time and led the effort to push for civil citations.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report shows school-related arrests by sheer numbers and by rate per 1,000 students in counties in 2011-12. We will cite a few examples:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami-Dade: 552, three per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broward: 1,062, eight per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillsborough: 1,046, 10 per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinellas: 846, 15 per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pasco: 316, 9 per 1,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the numbers of arrests statewide dropped in recent years after the state relaxed its &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy, critics say schools have still gone too far in criminalizing typical youthful behavior. We found arrests for infractions such as throwing spitballs, hitting someone with a tootsie pop or even for repeatedly &quot;passing gas.&quot; (The 13-year-old boy busted for flatulence never went before a judge; the Martin County school district told us the case was &quot;diverted/dropped with no record for the student.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vast majority of children being arrested in schools are not committing criminal acts,&quot; Walters told the Orlando Sentinel earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National comparison data lacking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the 12,000 figure isn't in dispute. But comparing Florida's school-related arrests to the rest of the nation was far more complicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National &quot;data-keeping in this realm is indeed pretty awful,&quot; said Kevin G. Welner, professor and director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado. That sentiment was echoed by multiple experts we interviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Florida does a better job than most states at compiling the data. An expert at the Southern Poverty Law Center said the state has the most comprehensive data in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dream Defenders sent us an article from Ebony, which stated, &quot;While Florida is not alone in turning to police to discipline young people, it has the distinction of being the nation's leader in school-based arrests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebony linked to a 2013 article in Color Lines, a magazine that focuses on issues pertaining to race. Its report stated: &quot;Last year, Florida produced the highest documented number of school-based arrests in the country ,, and that number was an improvement over previous years.&quot; (One expert we interviewed noted the important qualifier in that sentence: documented. As we'll see, little is documented in this area.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillum directed us to a 2011 report about Florida school arrests written by the Advancement Project, a national civil rights group, along with the ACLU in Florida and the NAACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Florida still has the highest documented number of school-based referrals to law enforcement in the country,&quot; states the report. A footnote had this to say: &quot;Currently, this data is not collected nationwide. Many individual states report this information, but no other state reports as many school-based referrals to law enforcement as Florida.&quot; We couldn't get a definitive answer from the group about how many states actually did report data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The report should have conveyed Florida's data is the highest on record,&quot; Advancement Project spokeswoman Jennifer Farmer told PolitiFact Florida. &quot;It may not be the highest in the country but it's highest on record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found some data is collected at the federal level by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. But that data appears to have significant gaps and inconsistencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniel Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California, pointed out a few examples of questionable numbers, including Los Angeles, which had zero referrals or arrests in 2009. Broward County had 6,640 referrals to law enforcement, but 0 arrests, while Miami-Dade had 1,670 referrals to law enforcement and 10 arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter the ranking, &quot;Florida has a very serious issue with overly punitive discipline and over-reliance on law enforcement that harms children and adolescents in the state, and is especially harmful to children of color,&quot; Losen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ruling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dream Defenders said, &quot;Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number about Florida is correct: There were 12,520 students arrested at schools in 2011-12, according to the state Department of Juvenile Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Dream Defenders failed to prove that the number makes Florida the nation's leader in school-related arrests. This appears to be a case of the state getting a bad rap because of its rare decision to publish comprehensive data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple experts said that comprehensive data for state-by-state comparisons is lacking. That makes it difficult to declare Florida's ranking for school-related arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We rate this claim Half True.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlton Park, Wiltshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">****</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Womad were a country, it would be pretty close to an earthly paradise. Hitting a new attendance record of 38,000 people over the weekend, the multicultural music festival's seventh year in its idyllic Wiltshire home was an overwhelmingly pleasant and Utopian experience, throwing into sharp relief the shortfalls of other major outdoor events. Accessible, clean, child-friendly and inclusive, this pan-generational carnival even had people on the main stage spelling out lyrics in sign language for the hearing-impaired. The only downside was an abundance of Bob Marley cover versions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first boutique festivals, the 31-year-old Womad created a model that is much imitated but so far never bettered. During that period, the narrow term &quot;world music&quot; has become increasingly fluid and almost meaningless, as this year's eclectic bill demonstrated. There are no simple genre labels to adequately describe the dazzling sound made by the Trinidadborn steel-drum maestro and Hot Chip collaborator Fimber Bravo, who whipped up a kinetic fusion of rock, electronic and calypso elements. Likewise the retro-jazz techno hybrid of Austria's Parov Stelar, or the British dubstep producer Mala's elegant synthesis of sinewy Cuban rhythms with supple machine beats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's headliners, the Atlantabased hippie-hop veterans Arrested Development, dedicated a song to Trayvon Martin and dropped an extended Black Power salute into the middle of their surprisingly gutsy, punchy set. There was more spiky social commentary from Emel Mathlouthi, the Tunisian singer now based in Paris after being banned in her homeland shortly before the revolution for which her songs were the soundtrack. A charismatic performer reminiscent of Bj&ouml;rk, Mathlouthi played a passionate multilingual show, mixing fiery folkpop chansons with floor-shuddering electronic interludes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was also a vintage year for spritely old-timers, with 77-year-old Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and 65-year-old Max Romeo forming a double act of eccentric reggae elder statesmen on Friday. The next day, the Anglo-Ghanaian Afro-rock collective Osibisa played in a heavy downpour, their septuagenarian frontman Teddy Osei vainly promising that the band's shimmering sunshine grooves would drive the rain away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday's headliner was Gilberto Gil, a former Brazilian minister of culture and dapper silver fox who appeared considerably younger than his 71 years as he crooned and twirled through 90 minutes of light-headed samba and rubber-limbed bai&atilde;o tunes. Gil also included an obligatory Bob Marley medley but he can be forgiven: when you are a living legend who helped to revolutionise South American music, you can pretty much play whatever you want, especially here in the people's republic of Womad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">662 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight American presidents owned slaves while living in the White House. President Zachary Taylor pledged that his fellow slave-owners would &quot;appeal to the sword if necessary&quot; to keep them. So when an American president arrived at the White House briefing room to speak of his personal experience with racial bias, it stirred some historical ghosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, President Barack Obama's 18-minute remarks did not aspire to memorable rhetoric. But he explained something uncomfortable and important: How America contains within itself different experiences of the promise and justice of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking as president, Obama responsibly affirmed the integrity of the legal process in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. Speaking as an African-American, he identified with the experience of being singled out for scrutiny. He talked of being followed in department stores and of being preceded by clicking car locks. He effectively conveyed a social reality many people seldom consider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some conservatives attacked Obama for being &quot;divisive&quot; and for injecting race into the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin debate. Those criticisms were misdirected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is appropriate for a president to apply his own history to his role as communicator and policymaker. Was it out of bounds for John F. Kennedy, who had a mentally disabled sister, to call for an overhaul of the nation's mental health system in 1963? Was it inappropriate for Lyndon Johnson, who grew up in Texas without electricity or indoor plumbing, to convene the National Advisory Commission on Rural Poverty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposite criticism is more serious - that Obama has missed opportunities over the years to talk about race in a compelling and personal way. It is the unavoidable American issue. At one point, a third of all human beings in the South were owned by another human being. For a century beyond slavery, Jim Crow laws enforced a racial caste system. The election of an African-American president is a wonder of national healing and historical compression. Who can argue that we have heard too much from Obama on this topic? For five years, he strategically downplayed the reality of his own miracle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having finally engaged the issue of race, Obama drew the correct policy implication. Social divisions are deepest when it comes to African-American boys and young men: often betrayed by schools, abandoned by fathers, treated with suspicion, unable to find jobs, wandering through dysfunctional neighborhoods, locked in prison in vast numbers and denied basic civil rights (such as voting) for the rest of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's speech deserves this criticism: Its policy proposals - training police, reconsidering &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, more community dialogue and &quot;soul-searching&quot; - were weak. It was as though the administration's policy apparatus had never really considered the matter before - that it was somehow ambushed by America's most obvious policy challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem of African-American boys and young men is a complex mix of lingering racial prejudice, urban economic dislocation, collapsing family structure, failing schools and sick, atomized communities. But is there really nothing practical that can be done? How about providing family supports - mentoring, fatherhood initiatives, teen pregnancy prevention, and removing the Earned Income Tax Credit penalty for married couples? How about strong accountability measures to close the educational achievement gap instead of granting waivers that lower standards? How about support for faith-based institutions that reclaim lives from gangs? How about prison reform, so that mandatory minimum sentences are at least reduced? How about expanding substance abuse prevention and treatment, which seem to have fallen off the national agenda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging a vast national division in a responsible way, as Obama has done, is not itself divisive. But healing that division will require the president to employ a presidential power he seldom uses: to drive and shape a policy debate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While growing up in the 1960s, I witnessed senseless discrimination against people because of their skin color, including neighbors who refused to help a black delivery driver who had slid off an icy road. In &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; we admire Atticus Finch as he defends Tom, who is falsely accused of raping a white woman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finch seeks justice while battling a prejudiced system. I am reminded of Martin Luther King's quote: &quot;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&quot; The Declaration of Independence states the same principle: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights ...&quot; The same awful prejudice is seen in the rush to find George Zimmerman guilty because he killed an unarmed black teenager. The news media tried and convicted him before any evidence was presented - falsely using pictures of Trayvon Martin as a child. Much of the black leadership and our president are creating mob action to lynch a man who, based on evidence, was shown probably to not be guilty of murder. Injustice based on skin color is ugly and evil. Today's torching of Zimmerman is as dangerous as that seen in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&quot; Stupidity results when people think with their skin instead of their brains.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four days after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman of murdering Trayvon Martin, U.S. marshals tracked Darryl Anderson to Birmingham, Ala. After a brief standoff, the 25-year-old thug on the lam from Baltimore emerged from an apartment with his hands in the air. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the verdict in the racially charged Florida case set off protests across the country, there were no demonstrations to celebrate Anderson's apprehension on July 17 --  but there should have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Baltimore police, Anderson is an enforcer for the Black Guerrilla Family, a West Coast gang that has planted deep roots in this Chesapeake Bay city that is in the throes of a tidal wave of gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson is believed to be the gunman who on June 27 was called on to settle a dispute among a group of black women in a Baltimore neighborhood. One of the women reportedly summoned Anderson and another man to a street where the other women were seated on a front porch and said: &quot;Do what y'all do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspect in shooting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say Anderson then opened fire on the women, killing one and wounding the others. Three days later, police believe he broke into a home and shot a man  during a robbery. Cops have been hunting Anderson since he allegedly killed a man in Baltimore County last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the women were brutally attacked, Baltimore police named Anderson the city's first Public Enemy No. 1. When he was arrested this month, they slapped that label on another member of the gang, 19-year-old Capone Chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chase, who is accused of killing of a 21-year-old man who was made to kneel on a city playground in front of his pregnant girlfriend before two bullets were pumped into his head, didn't get far. He was arrested here Thursday, four days after cops had designated him their Most Wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black-on-black violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal for killing the unarmed Martin had many activists up in arms. But the unrelenting slaughter of blacks by other blacks  continues to get scant attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's got to change. What Zimmerman did to Martin should have landed him in jail. But  it is not the rare act of white-on-black killings that turns black neighborhoods  into killing fields. It's people like Anderson and Chase who are responsible for this mind-numbing violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Baltimore's prison was no deterrent for these guys.  For years the place was run by Tavon White, an inmate who was a member of their  gang. Prosecutors say White headed an operation that co-opted 13 prison guards and used them to haul drugs, cellphones and other contraband into the jail, where  he sold them to other inmates. White, prosecutors say, was heard on a wiretap bragging that he ran the prison. He claimed to have netted $16,000 in one month. He also allegedly impregnated four of the female guards, one of whom gave birth to two of his children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as I am disappointed by the jury's verdict in the Zimmerman case, I'm outraged by the failure of the activists who protest it  to make what the Black Guerrilla Family gang is doing to black communities across this nation a target of their discontent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was getting ready to give a speech at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin when he glanced up at a giant video screen where old photographs of Johnson were being displayed. He was taken aback by what he saw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an image that captured the historic day the president signed the 1965 Voting Rights Act,  a young woman was standing nearby whose face Holder recognized immediately: his late sister-in-law, Vivian Malone, one of two young students who had walked past Gov. George Wallace in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first African American attorney general hadn't known that Malone was with the president when he signed the Voting Rights Act, which would become the cornerstone of modern civil rights law. That emotional day for Holder two years ago, aides say, was a pivotal moment in deepening his already strong commitment to the body of law that protects minority rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That commitment has driven a series of recent decisions by the attorney general, including his denunciation of &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in Florida and about 30 other states, as well as the Justice Department's move to intervene last week in a redistricting case in which officials say Texas is threatening to marginalize minority voters. Holder has made it clear that the defense of civil rights will be the centerpiece of the remainder of his term - and, he hopes, his legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attorney general's plate is full of every kind of legal issue that is presented involving the United States,&quot; said Columbia Law School professor Ted Shaw, a longtime friend of Holder's. &quot;But enforcing the civil rights laws is near and dear to his heart. And it has been for a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder's determination to defend civil rights has exposed him to allegations that he is effectively trying to circumvent the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again, the Obama administration is demonstrating utter contempt for our country's system of checks and balances, not to mention the U.S. Constitution,&quot; Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John Cornyn (R) said Texans &quot;will not stand for the continued bullying of our state by the Obama administration.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Justice Department has signaled that it will take fresh legal action in voting rights cases in a number of states - part of its effort to blunt the effect of the Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a critical part of the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday afternoon, Holder met for 45 minutes at the White House with President Obama, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and a coalition of civil rights leaders to emphasize the administration's commitment to ensuring full access to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting at the president's side, Holder told the group that Justice officials will try to work with Congress on a long-term fix to the section of the Voting Rights Act that was invalidated, said an official who was briefed about the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder also told the civil rights leaders that Justice plans to bring lawsuits against individual states to subject them to pre-clearance through the courts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,&quot; he told the group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who attended the meeting along with other leaders of African American, Hispanic and Asian groups, said: &quot;We've been assured by the president and the attorney general that they will continue to aggressively fight to protect the right of all Americans to vote. We are very encouraged by that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Monday meeting at the White House was the latest in a month of announcements and speeches that has placed Holder front and center in the national debate over civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the verdict in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, 17, in Florida, Holder gave two speeches to African American organizations, vowing to continue investigating the shooting as a possible federal civil rights violation. In a speech in Orlando, Holder denounced state stand-your-ground laws that allow people to defend themselves with deadly force if they think their lives are endangered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These laws try to fix something that was never broken,&quot; Holder said, adding that the measures &quot;senselessly expand the concept of self-defense&quot; and may encourage &quot;violent situations to escalate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same speech, Holder foreshadowed his next target: voting rights. He said he was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; by the Supreme Court's &quot;flawed decision&quot; in its June ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Justice Department's decision to intervene in Texas has gained much attention, administration officials say the Obama administration is likely to initiate a lawsuit against Texas over its voter-ID law, as well as a suit against North Carolina if it passes a strict voter-ID measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Texas, Justice is asking a judge to require that the state get pre-clearance on all voting law changes for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perez, who headed the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division before becoming labor secretary, said Holder's recent actions reflect his longtime commitment to protecting civil rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He set a tone from the outset that the Civil Rights Division was going to fairly, independently and aggressively enforce all the civil rights laws on the books,&quot; Perez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, upon becoming attorney general, met with the Civil Rights Division before any other division at the department. Since 2009, the division has opened 16 investigations of troubled police departments, issued 11 findings of misconduct of law enforcement agencies and reached 11 agreements for comprehensive reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington pundits speculated last year that Holder would step down after harsh criticism about the botched &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; gun operation run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The House voted to cite him in contempt of Congress for withholding documents and some lawmakers called for his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaw, Holder's good friend from Columbia Law School, said he does not know when Holder will leave the post. But he's sure of one thing: it will be when the attorney general thinks he has accomplished his goals and is ready to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eric is someone who is very strong,&quot; Shaw said. &quot;He is low-key in nature, but people shouldn't mistake that for someone who can be pushed around. A lot of those folks on the Hill wanted his scalp last year. They had their frenzy and they foamed at the mouth. And he is still there. &quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to pick the worst part of the George Zimmerman/Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, but I have to give my nod to Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which essentially legalizes murder if you claim it was self-defense afterward. I mean, with the witness or witnesses dead, who's gonna testify that it wasn't? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet this return to the discredited dictum of &quot;might makes right&quot; is popular in certain quarters -- which only proves (if it really needs proving) that when fear comes in the door, everything else -- including common sense -- goes out the window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defenders love to cite Martin's punching Zimmerman's lights out as justification for shooting an unarmed kid. Yet they never seem to care how the fight got started in the first place. Unless you can buy Martin's yanking Zimmerman out of his car, everything points to Zimmerman starting the fight -- and then pulling a gun when it turned out he'd bitten off more than he could chew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So by every known standard of decency, the wrong guy lost the fight. The real American -- minding his own business and willing to defend that right when challenged by an armed bully -- is dead, while the bully lives on, exonerated by an insane law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bullies, of course, are cowards, and &quot;Cowards die a thousand deaths while the valiant die but once.&quot; So Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead -- once -- while Zimmerman faces a lifetime of waking in cold sweats and looking over his shoulder. What a shame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zimmerman, by all accounts, felt Americans were losing their basic rights to groups of armed thugs. What he doesn't seem to realize is that he, too, is one of those armed thugs -- or that some of us fear an armed thug who's beyond the law more than we fear one who isn't.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past two weeks, culture and perspective have been hotly debated. Whilst the United States had the Trayvon Martin issue, Toronto was commemorating the Danzig shootings where two Black-Canadian gangs had an altercation at a block party last year. In South Africa, people were hoping Nelson Mandela would make his 95th birthday, while in Harare, the city council passed a motion asking people to consider cremating their loved ones instead of burying them.<BR>The most potent weapon in the hands of globalisation is the mind of a Zimbabwean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason culture remains the underlying theme of all these issues is simple. In North America, Black-Americans are discussing the need to take control of their culture after realising that one man, in this case President Barack Obama, could not change a 237-year-old institutionalised system of racial bias. In Southern Africa, the average Joe has no idea of the tsunami of Westernised capitalist destruction that is about to hit them, because they haven't dealt with or come to terms with their own culture issues in a modern world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seed of racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe blacks and North American blacks, two different cultures nevertheless the same race, are being influenced by the same system in different ways. As people celebrated Nelson Mandela's birthday, very few media outlets pointed out that this man had formerly been listed as a terrorist during his time with Umkhonto weSizwe, a group that believed in strategic bombings in order to achieve change. What happened to cause this man to suddenly become a darling of Western culture? Does it have anything to do with him having given up on ever defeating such an entrenched system and instead working within it? Racism is a seed; what keeps this seed growing is its institutions, organisations, policies, education and taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Harare, the issue of cremation has cultural undertones that hit home to all Zimbabweans. In Diasporan homes, Zimbabwean families have to make a decision about whether to ship a loved one home as a corpse or as ashes due to cost, without forsaking the cultural significance. These debates often fail to highlight the elephant in the room - westernisation and its offspring, capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to George Friedman, author of &quot;The Next Decade&quot;, the United States refuses to acknowledge that it is an empire yet the facts speak for themselves. According to him:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When American economic culture touches other countries, those affected have the choice of adapting or being submerged, the definition of free-trade simply means an international system that permits the vast American economy entering; to most if not the whole world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, if your society has not yet fixed its own cultural systems before the tide of Westernisation hits you, you are screwed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean sensitivities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paraphrasing Steve Biko, once the Zimbabwean disregards his own &quot;Zimbabwean Sensitivities&quot;, he or she is opening up, or at least prone to, incorporating other culture's sensitivities and beliefs to fill that vacuum. In North America, black people are very sensitive about how white people address them, this is important especially in a web-world where all the racism and bias has migrated to the institutions and capital systems. What of Africans who only know systems given to them by Western culture?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a Zimbabwean view black consciousness can be simply defined as: &quot;The ability of the Zimbabwean Consciousness to break away from the past Zimbabwean attitudes of the liberation struggle and to set a new style of self-reliance and dignity for Zimbabweans as a psychological attitude leading to new initiatives. At the heart of this kind of thinking is the realisation by Zimbabweans that the most potent weapon in the hands of globalisation is the mind of a Zimbabwean&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beware of change; those not prepared for it are often swept away in its filth. To the elders within Zimbabwe obstinately sticking to values they refuse to revise or accommodate in a globalised world, I assure you that other cultures have died from a lack of adaption. - mugaradzakasungwa@gmail.com</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 700 protesters gathered at the state Capitol on Sunday afternoon to ask the U.S. Department of Justice to file charges against George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of motorcyclists rode from Lithonia to the Capitol to join in the afternoon rally. The bikers roared down Washington Street in front of the Capitol at about 2:15 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to support the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin movement,&quot; biker Rick Hamilton, from Florida, said, adding that Martin &quot;represents a slew of other African-Americans&quot; who have been denied justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's good that we see peaceful protests,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, was found not guilty on July 13 in the 2012 death of 17-year-old Martin in Sanford, Fla., after Zimmerman's attorneys successfully argued that he shot Martin out of self-defense while the unarmed black teenager was assaulting him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This latest Martin rally was organized by the NAACP and featured Georgia State Conference NAACP President Edward O. DuBose, members of the Trained to Go Motorcycle Club and Derrick Boazman, host of &quot;Too Much Truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motorcycle club president Charles Ingram said his group has been following the Zimmerman case since the beginning and that the bikers were passionate to show their distaste of the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had to cut (the number of riders) off,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody was still coming, trying to participate in the ride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the protesters chanted, &quot;We want justice&quot; and &quot;We are Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DuBose addressed the rally between chants, urging the community to ban together against the kind of violence he said was allowed in the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that if the lawmakers don't want to change the law, people need to work to change the lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want George Zimmerman prosecuted,&quot; he said. &quot;This is about justice. I'm passionate. I'm emotional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group hoped to convince the Department of Justice to file federal charges against Zimmerman, including civil rights charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been more than 100 rallies across the country protesting the verdict. More than 75 people gathered for a Martin rally in Marietta on Saturday that had been rescheduled due to inclement weather the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people took to the streets of downtown Atlanta to rally on July 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several observations to be made on the trial and verdict in the George Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, why was the jury made up of women, all white except for one minority, and why were there no men on the jury? I find the composition of the jury suspicious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, why wasn't there punishment of some sort for George Zimmerman? He should have at least been given probation and community service, and should have been made to apologize to the family of the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, why were the Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson involved in the situation? Don't these two have more constructive activities in which to engage than stirring up racial distrust and hatred? Contrary to what these two men believe, many of the injustices to black Americans have been righted, and most of us know how to get along. That includes justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There always will be bigots - those who hate others on the basis of color, religion, gender orientation or something imaginary. These two men make a living by stirring up racial distrust and hatred. These are the type of people who prevent the rest of us from getting along. What is in it for them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why don't they encourage young people of all colors to look up to and respect black Americans such as Colin Powell, Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey and others who have made it in the American system despite hardships that we, especially young black Americans, cannot comprehend since they did not live through segregation and Jim Crow laws?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many young Americans are so ignorant of their history that they cannot appreciate the sacrifices made by people - whites and blacks - to ensure more justice, better educational opportunities and more economic opportunities for our black brothers and sisters. Yes, I have used the words &quot;black brothers and sisters,&quot; even though I am white. I am of the race of mankind; that makes every Jew, every Catholic, every Muslim, every Asian and every black person my brother or sister. Black history is my history, too, because it is part of American history, and I am an American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have lost Trayvon Martin, who had the potential to contribute to our society. A man will have to live with the guilt for the rest of his life, and his actions will affect his future and the future of his family. One might remember John Donne's Meditation XVII; Donne says, &quot;No man is an island.&quot; He ends with, &quot;(A)nd therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As have other situations, this situation affects all of us. The death of the young man and the lack of penalty for Zimmerman's actions have caused all of us to lose a little of ourselves, lose pride in being Americans and lose respect and trust for the legal and judicial systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should consider the care we give to our children to keep them out of harm's way and to one another.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS IS A RANT for all those protesters busting out windows and tearing up cars and beating people up. Where were you when O.J. Simpson was acquitted? The only thing you're accomplishing is our neighborhood watch had a meeting today and four of us went down and got concealed weapons permits. So don't come to our neighborhood in hoodies tearing things up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW THEY WANT to raise our taxes to put cam-eras down on the river. Why don't you just reassign tax money that's coming in for what you need? We do that every day on a daily basis - we reassign money in our families if we need something. Something else has to suffer just a little in order to accommodate a need. And if you can't do that in government, we're all going to be broke. Quit raising our taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MY GARBAGE CAN sits at the end of my driveway in some bushes. It's been that way for years. I am crippled and cannot pull the garbage can down the long driveway. I can manage to get the sacks of garbage to the can and that is all. If you want to come over and put my garbage can out every week, I would be glad to take you up on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO THE POWERS that be, it is time to cut the grass along the interstate and Bobby Jones Ex-press-way and clean up all the garbage that all this flooding has loosened up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHY I LIVE IN North Augusta ... a city government that works, a county government that works, a board of education that works and one day-a-week trash pick-up that works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A RANT FOR Columbia County Board of Edu-ca-tion's latest newsletter! Does &quot;Bullying&quot; only apply to students or are principals (including acting principals) allowed exceptions? Apparently elementary principals are allowed special tactics to reduce staff. Could this be a manner in which to eliminate tenured teachers with more advanced degrees and allow hiring of newer, inexperienced teachers at reduced salaries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AUGUSTA'S DOWNTOWN businesses have to pay an additional tax to obtain police protection? Really? It is a shame that Augusta is stuck with a sheriff who has no imagination. Tax-and-spend doesn't work in D.C., and it will not work in Augusta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S mother calls herself an Afro-Peruvian. If George Zimmerman's last name was Mesa, like his Peruvian-born mother's maiden name, we probably never would have heard about the Trayvon Martin shooting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor of THE EAGLE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question in my mind: the U.S. is going to collapse because of the incredible foolishness of its people. No foundation can handle the awesome weight of such gross stupidity. People don't read or hear or see. They see what they want to see, hear what they want to hear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a black person, white person or purple person really read the facts in the George Zimmerman case, he would realize the case has nothing to do with race, has nothing to do with the stand your ground law, has nothing to do with Zimmerman acting like a wannabe cop. For the uninitiated: 1) Zimmerman's neighborhood was being repeatedly robbed and the thieves never got caught. For this reason, Zimmerman joined the neighborhood watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman helped black people throughout his life, housing some, mentoring some, and standing up for a homeless black man who was mistreated by the police. He dated a black woman, and defended a homeless black man! Zimmerman did not bring up race when he saw Martin, the dispatcher asked what color -- white, black? The &quot;they always get away&quot; comment is due to NBC doctoring his 911 call and the network will face Zimmerman's attorneys soon. Zimmerman followed Martin only so that when the police arrived, he could direct them to his exact location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin acted foolishly. He had four full minutes to vacate the scene without issue. Instead, he doubled back, broke Zimmerman's nose, straddled him and began to pound his head on the concrete pavement. Zimmerman cried out for help but could not escape. There was one witness who identified the person with the black hoodie on top, which put Zimmerman on the bottom! Who is going to cry out? The guy on top or the guy on the bottom? Zimmerman cried out. Though the defense did not invoke the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law during the trial, Zimmerman surely satisfied it as he cried out and tried to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman acted as a responsible gun owner who believed his life was in jeopardy. Yes, it was a huge misunderstanding, and an unfortunate one, but it was Martin's actions that caused all of it. In our society, is it OK to attack someone following you and break their nose and bash their skull?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC and the press are putting politics above the truth to gain political points with minorities. All of this at the cost of truth, at the cost of America. A foolish nation indeed.JEFF BRANCA</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no turning back the clock on the nation-dividing trial of George Zimmerman, the neighbourhood watch volunteer who was acquitted in the shooting death of 17-yearold Trayvon Martin, but at a minimum, the verdict should prompt a broader discussion in America over the country's stand-your-ground laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions are in force in more than half of U.S. states and aren't without merit: the belief that a person has the right to defend his home from attack is at the core of a just and civilized society. The problem is that the defence doesn't require those who feel threatened to act in a manner commensurate with the perceived danger, rather to use the least amount of force necessary to thwart the attack. It also doesn't demand that those who feel threatened take steps to avoid a confrontation, and far from being limited to homes, in some states, the provision has been extended to cars and even public sidewalks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stand-your-ground law was cited as the reason for not initially arresting Zimmerman in February 2012, when he told police in Sanford, Fla., that Martin was beating him up during their scuffle and that he feared for his life. Though stand-your-ground was never raised during the trial, Judge Debra Nelson included a provision about the law in the instructions that allowed jurors to consider it as a legitimate defence, The Associated Press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is among those questioning stand-your-ground laws in the wake of Zimmerman's acquittal, saying they contribute to &quot;more violence than they prevent.&quot; Indeed, a controversial Texas A&amp;M University study claims standyour-ground has increased murders and manslaughter by eight per cent with no reduction in robberies, burglaries and aggravated assaults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation's attention, it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of selfdefence and sow dangerous conflict in our neighbourhoods,&quot; Holder said July 16 at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It's not that Canada itself has always struck the perfect balance when it comes to selfdefence. Joe Singleton of Taber hit a thief with the blunt end of a small hatchet in 2010 when a burglar suddenly tried to drive offafter ransacking his home, reportedly putting the resident's wife at risk. Instead of being applauded for his quick action, Singleton was charged with assault with a weapon and assault causing bodily harm, offences that carry up to 10 years in prison. Fortunately, the charges were later dropped when he completed the terms of an alternative measures program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the case of Toronto shopkeeper David Chen, who chased, captured and tied up an individual who was repeatedly shoplifting from his store, that prompted the Conservatives to pass the Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence Act, which came into force in March. It allows reasonable steps to protect property and was the first redefinition of self-defence since the Criminal Code was written in 1892.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada has taken long overdue action to ensure citizens have the right to defend themselves in a measured manner. In the United States, legislators might want to now consider curtailing the use of deadly force for perceived threats, particularly in a nation where gun ownership is so prevalent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial tensions in the United States are likely to rise if greater efforts are not made to narrow the rich-poor divide and create jobs for hard-pressed ordinary Americans, U.S. President Barack Obama has warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urging Washington to give up political point-scoring and focus on rebuilding America's sluggish economy, Obama said that years of stagnant wages and depressed incomes had left people &quot;anxious&quot; and &quot;frustrated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Racial tensions won't get better,&quot; he predicted in an interview with The New York Times. &quot;They may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested.&quot; In recent weeks, America has reexamined the race debate following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch captain, who shot dead black teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month also marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, when civil rights leader Martin Luther King delivered his &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech - an event that Obama said was not just about race, but about economic opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;... That that was a march for jobs and justice ... there was a massive economic component to that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS most of us who are used to racial injustices expected, George Zimmerman was acquitted in the slaying of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. In March 2012, I wrote about this case, referring specifically to the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law (the &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; in many states, including West Virginia). This not guilty verdict is also producing many viewpoints, and we can see the country is divided on the issue of race. This is my take: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DWI, driving while intoxicated. (This is commonly known to all of us). DWB, driving while black. (This is known to some of us). And, now, WWB, walking while black. This was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on that rainy night in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travyon Martin was put on trial. He was racially profiled. And he is dead. Now the question is what happens next? We need to mobilize, we need to organize, we need to continue the dialogue, and we need to learn empathy. Last year, my question was, can empathy be taught? There is great debate about this, but I believe that it can be taught. However, it must be taught from an early age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my classroom, I teach a guidance lesson called &quot;Walk a Mile in My Shoes.&quot; I get the students in a circle and they all take off their shoes! (This elicits groans, laughter and &quot;my socks are dirty&quot; comments.) After discussing the meaning of empathy - understanding how someone else feels - I start to ask questions. Who has felt bullied at school? Who has felt left out? Who has felt lonely?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then I get the kid who has had that feeling and another kid who has not had that feeling to trade shoes. They put on each other's shoes and &quot;walk a mile&quot; (around the room) while the rest of the class cracks up. We do this several times with different issues and at the end everyone trades shoes with someone and they all &quot;walk a mile.&quot; This is a very powerful lesson and one that the students remember from year to year (&quot;When are we going to do the 'walk' lesson again?&quot;) The goal is for students to be aware of the feelings of others and to act accordingly - to treat others with the same respect that we want them to treat us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the ultimate lesson. If we all could walk a mile in the shoes of a black teenager like Travyon Martin, would we then begin to understand the racial injustices that happen in this country on a daily basis? Let's teach empathy. Let's think about what it would be like to walk a mile in someone's shoes.</SPAN></P>

Thompson is hoping to woo black voters who backed Anthony Weiner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Bruinius Staff writer</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">USA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">911 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seizing on the implosion of former congressman Anthony Weiner's campaign, mayoral hopeful William Thompson delivered a surprising and full-throated denunciation of New York's &quot;stop and frisk&quot; crimefighting tactic Sunday, linking the polarizing police practice to the same kind of racial profiling that he said led George Zimmerman to shoot unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson's impassioned public statement, delivered to a mostly black congregation at the Abundant Life Church in the Brooklyn borough of New York, was unusual for the cautious politician, who has previously taken more moderate stances on stop and frisk, a policy that allows city police to frisk people they think might be involved in serious crimes. Leaders of the city's black community, meanwhile, have been outspoken critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, Thompson has avoided the heated topics of race, and that could partly explain his comparatively tepid support among black voters so far - a constituency Thompson needs in the upcoming Democratic primary. But Mr. Weiner's troubles come as an opportunity for Thompson. Black voters had been the strongest supporters of Weiner, and the main reason the former congressman had surged to the top of the polls before last week's reignited sexting scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason for Weiner's popularity among black voters, many have pointed out, was his outspoken criticism of stop and frisk, a policy Thompson has said he would continue, with modifications, if he were elected mayor. On Sunday, however, the former New York City comptroller, who is black, dialed up his rhetoric considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How did the system fail?&quot; Thompson said. &quot;Here in New York City, we have institutionalized Mr. Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to treat young black and Latino men with suspicion, to stop them and frisk them because of the color of their skin. Six hundred thousand of them in 2011 - more than 90 percent innocent - are profiled as Trayvon was profiled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the responses to Thompson's bold foray have been exactly what the candidate must have hoped. The Rev. Al Sharpton, president of National Action Network in New York and a critic of Thompson's views on stop and frisk, said the candidate's statement was finally &quot;on point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this could be a game change in terms of turnout in the black community,&quot; says Mr. Sharpton, who spoke to the Monitor by phone from an event in the White House. &quot;I think that a lot of people wanted to hear him a lot stronger - a lot of them were conflicted, and I think this clarifies a lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, in fact, likened Thompson's new aggressive stance to the mayoral campaign of 1989, when Sharpton was leading marches in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn to protest the killing of unarmed black teen Yusef Hawkins by a mob of bat-wielding white young men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Dinkins, who was running against then-Mayor Ed Koch, &quot;had been pretty mum, and then Koch came out ... and said we should stop marching,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;And then Dinkins, who had been pretty quiet up to then, said we have a right to march, and that what happened was a disgrace, and it gave him a moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I think the Dinkinses and the Thompsons are not civil rights leaders, so you usually don't discuss these things,&quot; Sharpton continued. &quot;But I think when times and events occur, they have to show leadership, and I think they did, and I think this will energize [Thompson's] campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton has not endorsed a candidate in this election so far, though he says he plans to do so before the Democratic primary next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tone, Thompson's speech was a remarkable departure from his previous views, which were among more the more conservative &quot;law and order&quot; positions in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has pledged to keep stop and frisk as a crime-fighting tactic, promising only to curb its excesses. And he has also opposed two controversial measures passed recently by the New York City Council: one that creates an independent inspector general to monitor the New York Police Department, and another that allows people to sue the department if they believe they have been illegally profiled by race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, he clarified his position on stop and frisk, saying he still supports the law but wants to &quot;make sure that government doesn't institutionalize suspicion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would say that my position on stop-and-frisk still is the same,&quot; Thompson said at a campaign event in front of City Hall. &quot;It is the continual concern that I think I have said for not even months, but for years, that stop-and-frisk, while a useful policing tool, it has been misused and abused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that the law is there; it's just a question of making sure that that law is enforced, by the mayor and by the police commissioner, and that things are done correctly,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Democratic primary approaching, Thompson's political motives are plain, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The clear political assumption is that he came out to show the African-American community that he's with them on a central issue,&quot; says Matthew Hale, a political scientist at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. &quot;He hasn't focused his candidacy around race or around him as the African-American candidate - that, I think, is part of who Bill Thompson is. But there is this possible strategic consideration: ... As the campaign gets closer to the finish line, most of the time you go back to what you perceive as your base voters, to make sure you can get them out and get them going.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 24</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican National Committee, working in partnership with the California Republican Party, announced Tuesday it has hired 23-year-old San Diego campaign operative Clinton Soffer as the party's state director for California. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soffer's mandate is to oversee GOP field operations as the besieged California party works to rebuild from the ground up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are thrilled to welcome Clinton on board; his expertise and experience will be an asset to our team as we look forward to 2014 and beyond,&quot; state party Chairman Jim Brulte said in a news release. &quot;I'm confident Clinton will help us build a formidable ground operation to compete for every vote, register new voters, and expand our outreach efforts into new communities across the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said the party is &quot;building the most expansive field program the GOP has ever seen, and we're doing it earlier than ever before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Republicans have never made this kind of investment in an off year,&quot; he said. &quot;The RNC will be in communities engaging with and listening to voters where they live, work and worship -- not months, but years before Election Day. Our state directors will play key roles in building a permanent field operation to be successful in elections this year, in 2014, in 2016, and beyond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his LinkedIn profile, Soffer got his political start working on a pair of San Diego City Council races in 2008. He then served as political director of the Lincoln Club of San Diego County for the 2010 primary and on the San Diego GOP for that year's general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soffer managed Scott Sherman's 2012 primary race for the San Diego City Council. Sherman narrowly won the race outright, avoiding a runoff. He then managed former Assembly Republican Leader George Plescia's unsuccessful race for the state Senate last November. He also has worked as a staffer for several San Diego officials and state lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 26</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Barbara Lee will host a screening of &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; the critically acclaimed movie about the last day of BART police shooting victim Oscar Grant, with other lawmakers next week in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee, D-Oakland, is organizing the event in conjunction with the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an especially timely film considering the tragic murder of Trayvon Martin and resulting verdict,&quot; Lee wrote in an invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee's office says Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, is planning to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screening is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. The invitation says lawmakers will be offered transportation from the Rayburn House Office Building at 7 p.m. or immediately after the day's last votes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing on BART train can be very dangerous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly designed BART cars have more open space for standees and bikes and many fewer seats. But the new train carriages are going to be surprisingly risky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When BART opened in the early 1970s, the new train system advertised &quot;A seat for every passenger.&quot; This wasn't just a marketing ploy to attract middle-class commuters, it was a safety issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART is a hybrid: It is at once an urban metro system that travels about 25 miles an hour, say between Powell and Montgomery, and an unusually fast suburban electric train system that travels more than 70 mph. A panic stop in a slow-moving metro will cause a few bumps and bruises, but any sudden stop in the high-speed parts of the system would lead to horrifying injuries or deaths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next time you're in your car on Highway 24 heading east, safely strapped in with your seat belt, look in horror at the standees on the BART train next to you. While BART has an admirable record for safety, a sudden stop or minor derailment could cause carnage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are these cars safe for standees at 70 mph?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real battle is about changing our cities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was lawfully acquitted under Florida's odious self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in California, he probably would have been convicted of manslaughter, not second-degree murder. The requirements for convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder could not have been met without a reasonable doubt. It is what it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been a terrible incident and it is symbolic of some very real injustices. But we have to be brutally honest about the real misperceptions that all of us hold about racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honestly, ask yourself that if Zimmerman had been a black man as well, would Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing have even seen the light of day? Since his death, thousands of black men have murdered each other and have been imprisoned for life, families have been destroyed forever, and a thousand children's futures grow darker everyday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what this battle should be about: to fight to change our cities and to meet and solve the injustices that plague us along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, let George Zimmerman deal with his own torments, I doubt that he'll need our help.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's store owners take extra precautions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have noticed while traveling in European downtown areas that most businesses have metal security doors that roll down to cover the shop windows and entrance doors when the business are not open; either solid panels like a garage door or strong mesh gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European cities are not inherently more dangerous, but individual shop owners do take additional precautions to protect their property when the shops are closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adopting the same type of measures where unruly crowds are known to gather would certainly reduce the broken windows that the business owners must now replace. No doubt, it could also help reduce burglary and smash-and-grab theft.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albany</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appalled, ashamed of police department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was both appalled and ashamed by the Oakland police chief's statement that &quot;the department hadn't known that the George Zimmerman jury would deliberate over the weekend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can someone in a position of leadership be so out of touch with current events? No amount of money or innovative strategies can take the place of simply staying connected to issues that impact everyone in our community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was also somewhat ashamed by my own reaction; my concern was with the immediate safety of my family and friends, who I advised to stay off the streets. But by the next morning, I realized we all need to be in the streets, to peacefully demonstrate our outrage at the conditions that have created so much fear and injustice in our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Eugene Robinson pointed out in his July 15 column, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin didn't stand a chance; the system is stacked against him. At the time of his murder, Martin had been suspended from school, a practice used all too often with young men of color that serves only to further alienate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where are the religious leaders, community organizers, and political leaders to organize us and create a public place where we can stand up for justice, better schools, and safer neighborhoods?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- A doctoral student in anthropology pleaded not guilty Friday to charges he smashed the window of a downtown Men's Wearhouse store during a protest last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzeen Doha, 34, who studies social anthropology and critical theory at UC Davis, is one of only two people charged in the late-night vandalism that erupted in downtown Oakland on July 13, 14 and 15 after protests against the Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed an unarmed black teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police and city leaders have pledged to crack down on the post-verdict vandalism that damaged stores, restaurants and community centers, but finding those responsible has proved difficult. Many wore masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chaotic events have also added to an ongoing debate over whether Oakland's frequent protests are fueled by youthful rage against racial injustice or more academic and anti-capitalist causes that attract activists from throughout the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doha, listed in police records as a San Jose resident, and his lawyer, Gabriela Lopez, declined to comment on the misdemeanor vandalism charge after a hearing at the Wiley Manuel Courthouse in Oakland. Police officers said in a written complaint they saw the storefront window spider and crash down after Doha swung an object at it with his right arm at about 10:45 p.m. on July 15, the third night of protests..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former philosophy lecturer and teaching associate at San Jose State University has described himself as a member of the Occupy movement on the UC Davis campus, where he has been a student since 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Capitalism cannot sustain itself,&quot; Doha said in an interview with an online publication last year, &quot;but we cannot be spectators either. We must act to accelerate this process, so we can open up a different future. ... The task is to identify certain points in the crisis and intervene accordingly to dismantle capitalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also charged in the Men's Warehouse vandalism is Oakland resident Lamar Caldwell, 27, who is scheduled for a hearing next week on a more serious felony vandalism charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caldwell, who also goes by the name Hannibal Shakur, protested his prosecution in a missive published online and asked for help paying his legal costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A window is made of sand and can be replicated exactly,&quot; Caldwell wrote. &quot;A rectangle window, of the dimensions I am being charged with breaking, doesn't need to be replicated because the manufacturer keeps spare windows around for replacement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, &quot;a human life is priceless because it can never be replaced,&quot; he said in reference to the Florida slaying of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE ONLY black candidate for mayor said Sunday the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy is driven by the same kind of bias that led to the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did die because he was black. Of that there is no doubt,&quot; William Thompson told the congregation at Abundant Life Church in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson then made his most forceful attack to date on the NYPD's controversial tactic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in New York City, we've institutionalized Mr. (George) Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to treat young black and Latino men with suspicion, to stop them and frisk them because of the color of their skin,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson added that young men of color &quot;are profiled, as Trayvon was profiled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson said his natural instinct is to steer clear of the topic of race. But in an unusually passionate speech, he said he felt compelled to speak out after Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not believe our government can fully stop racism, but I do believe we must constantly look to see how it may enable it, even unintentionally,&quot; he added. &quot;So we must ask ourselves, when fear of young black men ends in deadly violence against the innocent, has our government perpetuated that fear by targeting people of color with suspicion?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the peak of stop-and-frisk in 2011, more than 685,000 stops were made, and 87% of those stopped were black or Latino. Nothing criminal was found in 88% of the stops.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACIAL tensions in the United States are likely to deteriorate if greater efforts are not made to narrow the rich-poor divide and create jobs for hard-pressed ordinary Americans, President Barack Obama has warned. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Urging Washington to give up political point-scoring and focus on rebuilding America's sluggish economy, Mr Obama said that years of stagnant wages and depressed incomes had left people &quot;anxious&quot; and &quot;frustrated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Racial tensions won't get better,&quot; he predicted in an interview with The New York Times. &quot;They may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent weeks America has re-examined the race debate following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch captain, who shot dead the black teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next month also marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, when the civil rights leader Martin Luther King delivered his &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech - an event that Mr Obama said was not just about race, but more fundamentally about economic opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always remind people - and, in fact, I have a copy of the original programme in my office, framed - that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn't just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week Mr Obama will continue a national tour to push his inclusive economic message, giving a speech in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The president has been scorned by Republicans for his attempt to speak over the heads of Washington's gridlocked Congress, with senior Republican leaders calling for him &quot;get back to his desk&quot; and cut deals, rather than making campaign-style speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For his part, Mr Obama has made little effort to hide his disdain for the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which blocked gun reform after the Sandy Hook massacre, looks likely to block immigration reform and is spoiling for another budget fight in this autumn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Congress moves at such a glacial pace these days that sometimes if you start a bill like immigration and you're thinking this should be done by now, it seems to take a year of folks just sitting around spinning their wheels,&quot; he said. &quot;There's not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama remarks harm race relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama says that race relations have improved with each passing generation. That was true until he became the president. Since then, his words and his administration have done nothing but harm race relations. His 20-minute speech on July 19 about the George Zimmerman case and verdict is a perfect example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, if you take a look at Martin's life history - including divorced parents, drug use, suspension from school, graffiti, suspected burglary, fighting, etc. - Obama could have been him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is responsible for that? Apparently, he blames racism and racial injustice, at least in part. And his views have not changed over time, since he is now injecting the element of racism into this case, even when there is no evidence to suggest that race was a factor - other than the likelihood Zimmerman knew local authorities were on the lookout for young black males suspected of recent break-ins. Obama, saying he sensed the outcome would have been different if it had been a white male teen, is being totally racist. (It) is uncalled for, is without substance and merely harms race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also says many African-American men draw nervous stares on elevators and hear car locks when they walk down the street. Does he ever ask himself, &quot;Why?&quot; Does he ever look at crime statistics, by race, for murder, assault, rape and burglary? Or does he simply think everyone ignores or doesn't know about those statistics, and therefore people's fears and attitudes are merely due to racism? Therein lies our real problem with race relations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'An old and very sensitive wound'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over , not surprisingly, it seems to have caused more discontent. Putting this behind us would be the hope of a large portion of our citizens as, regardless of the verdict, this has once again opened an old and very sensitive wound that some would deny exists, while others believe it never has been treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The echo of this trial leaves all of us who are parents of African-American or biracial children asking what can we do to protect our children. You would be hard pressed to find a non-white child in the U.S. who hasn't had to sit through the &quot;conversation&quot; about how to dress, how to behave, how to talk - always &quot;yes, sir,&quot; &quot;no, sir&quot; - and if pulled over while driving, have your hands at 10 and two on the steering wheel, etc. Granted, this is good advice for all children; ours, however, face much more dire consequences if they don't take it to heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what do we do now? We've already done everything we can to make our children invisible. The boundaries we have set for our children are damned near as restrictive as Jim Crow laws. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We talk about the stand your ground law, but apparently we weren't told it is for whites only. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in his last conversation, told his friend that he was being followed. Just perhaps, he felt threatened enough to confront the threat. Maybe he was tired of living the &quot;conversation&quot; and decided to make a statement that, considering the circumstances, was a perfectly logical reaction for a 17-year-old man/child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't have any of the answers. I imagine this will be like arguments about gun control, full of righteous indignation, that will last about a month at most - or until CNN finds the next story. The saddest part of this whole episode is the victim. Trayvon is the only one who is blameless. ... But, at the same time, I'm running out of questions. How many times can one ask, &quot;Why?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confusion over separation of church and state seems only to have grown after two recent El Paso events that expressed very different views. One group would have us believe that absolute separation is necessary. The other group tells us there is no separation. It's more complex than that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is directed toward government, not religion. It restricts government in order to safeguard freedom of religion. It doesn't say anything about what religious institutions can or cannot do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some folks think that religion has nothing to say in public. Freedom of religion includes freedom of speech concerning any and all areas of public and private life. Religious groups also have the right to organize politically to promote their views. Party affiliation and campaigning are not, and should not, be part of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the limits. Religion has an important role in the life of society. It can help us to reach responsible conclusions and take just action. Whether religious views have an impact and shape civil policy is dependent on whether they are reasonable and support the common good. Some religious views may not fit those criteria and may harbor unjust attitudes. It's up to us all to discern the differences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paper misses Obama's speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I opened this morning's paper and could not find one single mention of President Obama's speech from the day before. The impression this gives is that attempts to do something about jobs and the economy matter as little to the El Paso Times as it does to members of Congress, whose sole goals seem to be obstruction and tearing down government, rather than offering constructive solutions to our nation's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Times graphics, however well designed, mean little when stories about a royal baby's new name and possible changes in mail delivery take precedence over an important presidential speech.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic&quot; -- Benjamin Franklin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon initial reading one may assume Franklin's comment pertains to politicians voting themselves money. However, the inclusive -- the people -- suggest a broader meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people do not, by national referendum, vote to establish, maintain or expand social assistance programs. However, the people do select politicians who promise to establish, expand and maintain programs by which minorities of our population gain a direct or indirect financial benefit. So, in effect, the people do vote themselves money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we have witnessed since the inception of the social engineering schemes of the mid-1960s our social services depend-population has grown to 47 percent of our population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If organized under the flags of ACORN and APPOLO, etc., these have-nots could form a voting bloc capable of demanding a slim majority, 53 percent of our population, and submit to increasing wealth-distributing taxation to the point of complete middle-class destruction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">County makes good decision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by El Paso County Commissioners Court to add a &quot;plus one qualifying adult&quot; to its health benefit program is a step in the right direction. Not only is such action proper, but it's well-deserving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We live in an age in which people often prefer to live together before marriage, or not to marry at all. These are practices that do not really impose a burden on anyone else because they take place by mutual consent and do not define anyone else's concept of marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county ordinance also places the burden of proof as to whether someone should be added to the health program on the county employee, who is obligated to pay for the additional health-care cost as a deduction from wages earned, and who can terminate the health coverage and payroll deduction if the relationship no longer exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the best thing about it is that it eliminates legal challenges from outsiders, such as those faced by ex-El Paso Mayor John Cook, who sought to remove him from office for trying to provide city health service benefits to all city employees on an equal basis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman trial: justice denied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One juror in the George Zimmerman trial said Trayvon&nbsp;Martin should have just walked home. Are you joking? The defendant, Zimmerman, had Trayvon profiled and targeted, otherwise why did he follow him -- stalk him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was scared to death of him. Zimmerman did not identify himself as a law officer or a person of authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon reacted in accordance with Florida law -- stand your ground. He was exercising the right to defend himself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthea Butler: America may be a nation of 'free speech', but be prepared to be bullied and harassed for speaking up, especially on race <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours after the George Zimmerman verdict, I found myself at my computer, calling to mind a text I had first read in seminary. The text, Is God a White Racist, By Rev. Dr. William Jones, is still studied by theologians and academics and taught in institutes of higher learning. The book called into question the chief construction of black liberation theology: that God is on the side of the oppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones' thesis was simple: God wasn't on the side of the oppressed, and that the tortured history of African Americans' experience in America with slavery, violence and the civil rights proved it. The theme resonated with me as I sat down towrite a piecereacting to the Zimmerman verdict for the online magazine Religion Dispatches. Little did I know that the book's title alone would cause an avalanche of vitriol against me, my race, my institution - even my hair. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screeds came via Twitter, email to myself and my university, conservative blogs, and - the coup de grace - Rush Limbaugh's airways. The piece was hijacked and &quot;repurposed&quot; from its original meaning to show that I was a racist because I had dared to talk about race. I had dared to talk about an &quot;American god&quot;, which was clearly not GOD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Zimmerman verdict, several Black academics have received the hate tweet and email treatment from those disgruntled with our analysis of the role of race in the trial. Some, like Mark Sawyer of UCLA, even had social media accounts hacked. I created a Tumblr of racist tweets and emails to both chronicle the racist missives of my detractors, both for campus security and as a teaching tool. Several theologians wrote responses buttressing my piece, but the right wing spin machine portrayed me as a racist, liberal professor with bad ratings who should be fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the role of a public intellectual in the age of Twitter and soundbites? Is it to share your thoughts for the public good, or is it to curate the heaps of hate emails, tweets and right-wing articles that trash your intellectual and social work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an academic who occasionally appears on television and writes both for the academy and the public, these questions are at the forefront of my mind as I both teach and mentor graduate students. It is one thing to endure the ire of your peers, quite another to have hatred heaped on you publically. Tenure was a walk in the park compared to the harassment I receive. Since September of 2012, when I made a comment on Twitter about a movie that was then thought to be the reason behind the attack on the American embassy in Benghazi, I have been routinely subjected to screeds from Fox news, Weazel Zippers, Twitchy, News Busters, and a myriad of other sites that have targeted me for my &quot;liburl&quot; viewpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of Pennsylvania, and my wonderful colleagues in the Department of Religious Studies have been routinely sent hate emails about me. Calls to fire me are numerous. Some have even come from within the university. The Penn Switchboard is flooded with calls, and the more conservative alums threaten to stop contributing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this age of pseudo parity, when everyone, anyone with a computer can critique one's work and life, what passes for knowledge? We know how to measure the worth of articles and books in the academy. The public has another standard altogether. In the age of conservative grievances about education however, how many people will be willing to go through what I do every time I publish an op-ed or in order to share what they have spent a lifetime to learn?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not many. Because of what David Frum so aptly referred to as the &quot;conservative entertainment complex&quot;, the feeding frenzy on the web to be the first to soundbite words and opinion pieces to get page hits and followers is fierce. Spin, spew and repeat is the name of this game. In the hopes of silencing me, they are willing to attempt to deny my first amendment rights through a barrage of hate in order to preserve theirs. Religion, race, and sexuality are all subjects they feel free to weigh in on, and these are the ones they so often attack when the viewpoints expressed are not conservative ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I am a tenured faculty member, many younger scholars are being stymied from sharing with the public because of these types of attacks. There are plenty of battles within the academy about race and racism. When the right-wing echo chamber comes together to disparage and shout down voices engaging the public by accusing us of racism, they become the race baiters they so desperately seek to call me. I only wonder what William Buckley or Barry Goldwater would say if their could see their intellectual heirs today. I have no illusion that either man would like me, but I could imagine we could have a more civil conversation than what I experienced in this last academic year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is in a fragile place right now. Those on the right believe that they want to take their nation back, and those on the left believe that what our nation stands for is being eroded away by the policies of those on the right who want to return to the good old days. Universities and colleges are one of the few places in America that we can engage these ideas in the classroom without cursing and denigrating those we disagree with. Whatever side you find yourself on, ask yourself if the present state of discourse in print and on the air is what you want your children and students to grow up with.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Americans are angry about the Zimmerman verdict as most have known such racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If nothing else, the first black president should be good for explaining to white America exactly what it is that makes black folks tick. In a speech many of us had been waiting for, Barack Obama explained why so many people, especially black Americans, are devastated and angry about the not guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. He delivered a long overdue wake-up call: racism is still a problem. As he told it, as black folks, we see the racism in Zimmerman's actions because most of us - including himself - have experienced that racism. We do not believe justice was served in this case because American justice has existed to put black America in its place. We are not angry because we are out of control, but because racism is a tiring, pervasive, helpless type of pain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Obama's &quot;trust me, it happens&quot; depictions of racism will bring a few heads out of the post-racial sands in which they've been buried. Maybe it takes the president to convince racism-deniers that people still see (and act on) colour, and that most black folks are not bent on &quot;playing the race card&quot;. So, if someone racially profiled Obama, then it must really be happening and it must be wrong. But Obama shied away from the root: race is only a problem if one race is presumed to be vastly better. I don't mind - and in fact hope - that you see my colour, as long as you don't think I'm a problem because of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our president dismissed a national conversation on race, and rightfully so. America doesn't need it. America needs a conversation on white supremacy and how the stereotypes, fear and privilege that grow from it poison the thinking of every American. As we've inched closer to equality, many Americans have come to believe white supremacy only takes the hooded, cross-burning form. However, it is white supremacy that has almost every culture stereotyping its darker members as criminal. Meanwhile, the white race enjoys the privilege of not having to think much about such things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fervently locked car doors and clutched purses Obama admitted to facing lead to hurt feelings, but a black body in the wrong place at the wrong time leads to a suspicious presence that, in the case of Trayvon Martin, can mean death without justice. The very idea that a grown man could fear a lanky teen because black people are frightening, an idea the Zimmerman jury believed, is deeply ingrained in the American psyche. The clutched purse, Zimmerman's itchy trigger finger, and the portrait of Martin as anything but a helpless child have white supremacy to thank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama might have known that talk of white supremacy would bring out the conservative watchdogs and turn off the average American. This is unfortunate, because everyday white people, who listen to hip-hop or watch Oprah and consider themselves enlightened, can then decide they aren't part of the problem. They examine their own &quot;bias&quot;, and because they feel guilty when they occasionally stereotype people, quickly find none. They recoil at the outward racism of their backward relatives and feel good because they are on the not-racist side of white America. But they also don't feel anti-racism is their fight, and can you blame them? To take it on as such would mean relinquishing their ever-present white privilege and replacing it in part with the sting of black pain. So in this zero sum game, change comes slowly, if at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we recognise, openly, the system upholds the right to defend property with guns over the right of the average citizen, especially suspicious dark ones, to simply exist, there can be no progress. We can only solve our &quot;race problem&quot; when the white supremacist beliefs are acknowledged by Americans of all colours, so that we we can begin to eliminate those beliefs. Until then, the effects of racism will persist, unchecked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a shift in Washington to encourage growth over &quot;damaging&quot; austerity, President Barack Obama said, the middle class would shrink. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a week when he tried to focus attention on the struggles of the middle class, President Barack Obama said in an interview that he was worried that years of widening income inequality and the lingering effects of the financial crisis had frayed the United States' social fabric and undermined Americans' belief in opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upward mobility, Mr. Obama said in a 40-minute interview with The New York Times, ''was part and parcel of who we were as Americans.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''And that's what's been eroding over the last 20, 30 years, well before the financial crisis,'' he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If we don't do anything, then growth will be slower than it should be. Unemployment will not go down as fast as it should. Income inequality will continue to rise,'' he said. ''That's not a future that we should accept.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few days after the acquittal in the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, prompted him to speak about being a black man in the United States, Mr. Obama said the struggle over race would not be eased until the political process in Washington began addressing the fear of many people that financial stability is unattainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Racial tensions won't get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, who this autumn will choose a new chairman for the Federal Reserve who will share economic stewardship, expressed confidence that the trends could be reversed with the right policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy is ''far stronger'' than it was four years ago, he said, yet many people who write to him still do not feel secure about their future, even as their current situation recovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's what people sense,'' he said. ''That's why people are anxious. That's why people are frustrated.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During much of the interview, which was conducted on Wednesday, Mr. Obama was philosophical about historical and economic forces that he said were tearing at communities across the country. He noted at one point that he has in the Oval Office a framed copy of the original program from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom nearly 50 years ago, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ''I Have a Dream'' speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He uses it, he said, to remind people that ''that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that. When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn't just folks who believed in racial equality. It was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For decades after, Mr. Obama said, in places like Galesburg, people ''who wanted to find a job - they could go get a job.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They could go get it at the Maytag plant,'' he said. ''They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a shift in Washington to encourage growth over ''damaging'' austerity, he added, not only would the middle class shrink, but in turn, contentious issues like trade, climate change and immigration could become harder to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Striking a feisty note at times, he vowed not to be cowed by his Republican adversaries in Congress and said he was willing to stretch the limits of his powers to change the direction of the debate in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I will seize any opportunity I can find to work with Congress to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security,'' Mr. Obama said. But he added, ''I'm not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing for the first time one of his most anticipated decisions, Mr. Obama said he had narrowed his choice to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve to ''some extraordinary candidates.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With current fiscal policy measurably slowing the recovery, many in business and finance have looked to the Fed to continue its expansionary monetary policies to offset the drag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said he wanted someone who would not just work abstractly to keep inflation in check and ensure stability in the markets. ''The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better,'' he said. ''I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, Let's make sure that we're growing the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leading Fed candidates are believed to be Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama's former White House economic adviser and President Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary, and Janet L. Yellen, the current Fed vice chairwoman and another former Clinton official. The president said he would announce his choice ''over the next several months.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More clearly than he did in three speeches on the economy last week - the next is scheduled for Tuesday in Chattanooga, Tennessee - Mr. Obama called in the interview for an end to the emphasis on budget austerity that Republicans ushered in when they captured control of the House in November 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The priority, he said, should be spending for infrastructure, education, clean energy, science, research and other domestic initiatives of the sort he twice campaigned on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we've spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits,'' Mr. Obama said. He called for a shift ''away from what I think has been a damaging framework in Washington.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president did not say what his legislative strategy would be. Even as he spoke, House Republicans were pushing measures in the opposite direction: to continue into the budget year that starts Oct. 1 the across-the-board spending reductions that Mr. Obama opposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans are also threatening to block an increase in the government's borrowing limit - an action that must be taken by perhaps November to avoid a financial crisis - unless Congress withholds money for his health care law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama all but dared Republicans to challenge his executive actions, including his decision three weeks ago to delay until 2015 the health care law's mandate that large employers provide insurance or pay fines. Republicans and some legal scholars questioned whether he had the legal authority to unilaterally change the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delay in the employer mandate, which mostly affects large businesses that already insure workers but are worried about federal reporting requirements, was ''the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program that's starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody,'' Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If Congress thinks that what I've done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, they're free to make that case,'' he said. ''But there's not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president's latest campaign for his agenda began as national polls last week showed a dip in his public support. The declines were even greater for Congress and Republicans in particular, in their already record-low ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama said he would push ahead with a series of speeches that lay out his agenda ahead of the fights this autumn with Congress. ''If once a week I'm not talking about jobs, the economy and the middle class,'' he said, ''then all matter of distraction fills the void.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know the drill all too well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the day, with all the pain and agony that it entails, Israel will release Palestinian terrorists who murdered scores of innocent people. And these murderers will be hailed as heroes in Hebron and Ramallah and Jenin. Parades will be held in their honor, flowers thrown at the bus carrying them home, poems written about their &quot;glorious&quot; exploits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's bad enough to free the terrorists, and that bad will be made even worse by the reception they will receive in the Palestinian Authority. Some will argue, &quot;What do you care about how they are received? Your terrorists are their freedom fighters.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we do care about how they are received. It matters. It sets tone and atmosphere. It says something about our peacemaking partners. It chips away at our confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel's release of the Palestinian prisoners will be trumpeted around the world as an Israeli &quot;confidence-building&quot; measure. And that is part of the problem. The Palestinians, backed by the world, consistently demand that Israel build up their confidence. But how about Israeli confidence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is being done to rebuild an Israeli confidence trampled by the second intifada and stomped upon by the thousands of rockets that fell on Israel after it withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005? What are the Palestinians doing to convince Israelis that something fundamental has changed, and that they do want to live in peace and security next to Israel, not on top of it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have they toned down the rhetoric? Have the rocks stopped being hurled at Israeli cars over the Green Line? Has a Palestinian version of Peace Now, perhaps funded by the EU, swept up the masses to push Palestinian society to an acceptance of Israel, and to press the PA government to drop its maximalist demands and return in earnest to talks? Have pro-peace rallies broken out throughout the West Bank?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the world will laugh at the idea of having to build Israel's confidence, saying it is not for the weaker side - the Palestinians - to build up the confidence of the stronger - Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those making that argument are blind to Israel's reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second intifada was a watershed moment for Israeli society. This was when a lack of physical security was brought home to every Israeli man, woman and child. It was when riding a bus in Jerusalem was more dangerous then patrolling along the Lebanese border. This was a trauma that has not been erased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed it was compounded in 2005 when, after Israel withdrew from Gaza, a million people in the South were forced to begin living with the insecurity of knowing that at any moment a primitive rocket could come crashing through their living room window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That type of reality - the mind-numbing terrorism of the second intifada and the insecurity born by living under the specter of rocket fire from Gaza - can just suck the confidence right out of you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior US officials involved in the current diplomatic process are well aware, and empathetic, of Israel's security concern. Indeed, they often say that not only do they understand it, but they are trying to increase the average Israeli's sense of security by funding Iron Dome and training Palestinian security officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this Israeli confidence cannot just be built up by anything the Americans do. It can help, but it is not enough. This confidence can only be built up by the Palestinians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the Palestinians can give Israelis the feeling that something has changed, that this time something is different. Demanding the release of 100 murderers does not do the trick. What will make matters worse is to have these murderers then hailed again by the Palestinians as heroes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Palestinians are indeed serious about the upcoming round of talks, they need to make that apparent to the Israeli public. One way to do this is not to celebrate the release of terrorists who threw petrol bombs into buses and incinerated innocent men, women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, when Americans were debating the acquittal of George Zimmerman for second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old African-American high school student Trayvon Martin, a quote attributed to American novelist William Gaddis was frequently cited: &quot;Justice? You get justice in the next world. In this world, you have the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the debate over the Palestinian prisoner release, not only is there no justice, there is also no law, because the law that put the terrorists behind bars is being set aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of justice or law, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is arguing that there may be some benefit in releasing the prisoners, in terms of an improvement of Israel's status in the world, and an improvement of Israel's ties with the Palestinians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the public to get fully behind that process, it will need to see the benefits. Those benefits will be obscured by Palestinians seen celebrating the release of murderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those in Washington and elsewhere who urged Israel to swallow the bitter pill of a prisoner release in order to restart the diplomatic process need to be no less persuasive now in getting the Palestinians to tone down the hero worship expected to greet the release of the prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it encouraging Palestinian confidence-building measures.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenie Desmond-Harris (c) 2013, The Root</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">945 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Slate's William Saletan asked me to throw some ideas around with him as he composed a list of tips for &quot;how to talk constructively about racism&quot; in the wake of white-Hispanic George Zimmerman's controversial acquittal in the shooting death of unarmed African-American teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I always sigh a little when I hear the calls for a &quot;national conversation on race&quot; that follow when inequality and injustice are brought to our attention in a big way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even President Barack Obama acknowledged in his remarks about Zimmerman's acquittal that these conversations haven't been &quot;particularly productive.&quot; I get it, though. The idea is that Americans might not totally understand what's happening (in the Zimmerman case, it's the insanely unfair, deeply rooted and, in fact, deadly bias that black men face and how it's perpetuated), that we need the tools and information to do so and that providing those things will involve a lot of talking about it, both privately and publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we're going to have a &quot;conversation on race,&quot; I offer this nonexhaustive list of ground rules and reminders. It's based on my hope that we can retire some of the predictable talking points and misleading themes that do nothing but derail the type of dialogue that's been called for once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Talking about race isn't racist. Don't say that. Vilifying people who discuss race and point out racism - making them the bad guys - is one of the ways racism is maintained. So is acting as if &quot;blacks suffer from racism&quot; and &quot;whites suffer from reverse racism&quot; are equally valid points of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Yep, sometimes there are different standards for black and white stuff. You are going to get a different reaction for White History Month and Black History Month. A black person making a joke about race is different from a white person making a joke about race. To accept this requires letting go of the idea that this is really simple and thinking a little deeper about context and history. Please give up on the &quot;But what if the races were reversed?&quot; line of thinking. That type of analysis makes conversations simple, but it also makes them totally unhelpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. African-Americans are not monolithic. There is no one black experience nor black point of view. Black people are individuals who don't agree on everything and shouldn't have to answer for one another's actions, any more than white people do. (So saying a black person can't dislike the n-word because rappers use it doesn't make sense.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Remember that while &quot;race&quot; itself isn't real, racism is, and our country's long and well-documented history with racism has very real, lasting effects. Therefore, being &quot;colorblind&quot; is not helpful because it cripples our ability to deal with the tangible effects of racial inequality in just about every area of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Black people shouldn't have to fit your definition of what's respectable to deserve equality or justice. It's silly and unfounded to blame inequality caused by institutionalized racism on, say, sagging pants or rap music. If you want to celebrate black people who are educated and high-achieving and defy persistent stereotypes, great, but that can't be a requirement for fair treatment. We got into trouble with this type of thinking when evidence that Trayvon was a normal teenager messed up so many people's impression of him as a sympathetic victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Don't defer to people like Bill Cosby about their theories about black people, any more than you would defer to a miscellaneous white celebrity about how white people are doing. If you need guidance, look for someone whose background offers evidence that he or she had the incentive to spend some time seeking information and thinking critically in a professional capacity about whatever it is the person is discussing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Individual racism and systemic racism are two different things. We should care about all the structures that maintain racial inequality, not just individual actors. (This is why it's not unreasonable to jump from Zimmerman's impression of Trayvon to racial profiling by police.) That said, individual acts can provide strong reminders about larger attitudes and problems. Ahem, Paula Deen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Don't give the word &quot;racism&quot; so much power that you can't speak rationally after you hear it. Remember that the threshold for &quot;racism&quot; is a lot lower than being a member of the KKK and hating every black person you see. It means buying into and perpetuating things that support the idea of white supremacy. You can be a very nice person and still do that, even without meaning to. You can do it even if you have black friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Resist the urge to believe and regurgitate myths about black people, even when they're promoted by black people (African-Americans are all more homophobic, black-on-black crime is uniquely bad, there are more black men in prison than in college, all black women love being fat, etc.). Take a minute to challenge the things you hear many say over and over. You'll often find they don't have a strong basis in reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Finally, stop thinking about and discussing racism as something that's the problem of black and other nonwhite people. Remember that there's an ever-growing movement of anti-racist white people concerned with dismantling white privilege. When you're talking about racism, remember that it's not just bad for those whom it oppresses; it's bad for everyone because it creates an unjust society. When people want to fix racism, they do it not because they're being charitable or nice, but because they're being smart and decent</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trustee's record insufficient</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Monterey Peninsula College was forced to vote by districts instead of at-large, the dissenting voices were concerned that some districts may find it difficult securing candidates. That is exactly what has occurred in Marina, where the sitting trustee has attended only one board meeting in person in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, her attendance during her 3&frac12;-year tenure is abominable (you can look it up). Although the district has gone out of its way to provide a telephonic hook-up during meetings, she misses all the interaction with the audience. Further, she has also not attended closed-session meetings where personnel items are discussed. In addition, the lawsuit she filed in 2011 for damages due to a fall in a dance class (medical insurance is provided by the college for all trustees) is still pending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does a trustee vote on budget matters, a primary responsibility, while a lawsuit against her own board is in progress?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the benefit of the students, faculty and staff of our wonderful community college, we urge the good citizens of Marina to find a citizen with good judgment to run for the MPC board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Tunney, Lynn Davis and Charlie Page<BR>former MPC trustees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ineffective representative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I retired two years ago after working 27 years at Monterey Peninsula College. At the time of my retirement, I had been a faculty program coordinator since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPC employees are not allowed to publicly comment on board elections. As a retiree, I no longer have that constraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am in complete agreement with the three former trustees concerning Margaret-Anne Coppernoll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I live in the Marina district and will admit that I voted for her during her first candidacy. My mistake! Coppernoll has been an embarrassment from the beginning. She has been an ineffective representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to her physical absence from many meetings since 2011, she has not been completely engaged in the budget issues affecting the school's focus and direction given the new directives from the state. I am also appalled by her lawsuit. This seems to be an extreme conflict of interest on her part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marina and Seaside fought for representation on the board. The Marina district deserves a trustee who is fully engaged and has studied the issues facing the school. I hope another candidate will come forward. I would not support her run for re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marilyn Townsend<BR>Marina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race is too often a factor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am genuinely saddened and disappointed by the recent events that have led me to think about the issue of race in this country. From the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin/George Zimmerman fallout to the attack on the Voting Rights Act in the southern states, it is clear that, regardless of the fact that we elected an African-American president, race is still a factor in how we treat our fellow man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to wonder about the viability of a species that is so short-sighted that it measures the quality of a person not by their thoughts and actions but by the amount of melanin in their skin. Not only are we the only planetary animals that randomly kill each other out of something other than raw survival, apparently we are also the ones that simply can't get past something as superficial as how a person looks in our dealings with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am truly, deeply, worried for us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olga Chandler<BR>Marina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shooting arrows from ivory towers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think any reasonable person feels good about the George Zimmerman/Trayvon&nbsp;Martin debacle. A boy is dead and the man who killed him is the only person who knows the truth. I think Zimmerman had no business carrying a gun and acting out cop fantasies. I do not see Zimmerman as a victim of anyone but his own delusional inner world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juries are composed of human beings and all of us are fallible and biased in one way or another. Just as the racially-stacked jury acquitted a very guilty O.J. Simpson in 1995, so it is that perhaps there was racial bias in the jurors who acquitted Zimmerman. What's the alternative? Scrap the jury system across America and let equally biased judges decide the fates of the accused? Challenge every single verdict across America where the perpetrators and victims are of different ethnicity? Shall the president of the United States stick his nose into every single trial that involves people of color?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I keep reading poorly conceived and hysterical missives in The Herald from both sides of this issue but nobody has proposed a flawless alternative to our inherently flawed jury system. Shooting arrows from ivory towers solves nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. not guided by fanaticism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arlen Grossman seems to equate our misguided wars in the Middle East with worldwide Islamic terrorism (July 27).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this explain or justify bombing trains in Spain, hotels in Bali or bombs in Boston?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have made serious errors but it is not religious fanaticism that guides us. One hundred thousand people were killed in Syria in a sectarian civil war without American involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explain that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't hide cancer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cancer is a major illness. Society and those affected by cancer, in general, should not hide the illness from the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respected people within the community should not be embarrassed or have something to be ashamed about when diagnosed with cancer. In contrast, poor people who are dying from cancer are never in the limelight and are easily forgotten by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personally, I am lucky to be alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cancer was my wake-up call. My mission would be an inspiration for others affected by this illness. Perhaps, study medicine and become the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula badly needed colostomy educator specifically for men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is amazing how many Monterey Peninsula residents are treated at Pacific Cancer Care and we will be a force to reckon with.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its founding 30 years ago, Harlem Stage has burnished its reputation by presenting innovative artists like Bill T. Jones and Vijay Iyer and plumbing social issues. Now, the theater is betting that ''Makandal'' -- its first opera commission and an ambitious, contemporary work revolving around the leader of an 18th-century slave revolt in Haiti -- will raise its international profile and win it respect as a producer. But the group faces large hurdles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, Harlem Stage still needs to raise about $500,000 for its plan to produce and tour the multimedia opera in the United States, Haiti and South Africa once it has its premiere next fall at the company's 196-seat performing-arts center, called the Gatehouse, at 135th Street and Convent Avenue in Hamilton Heights. While Harlem Stage's works have traveled before, it has never before taken sole responsibility for producing and touring. There are also a host of practical considerations in transferring the two-hour opera's video projections, animation and lighting to places like a park in Port-au-Prince. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Patricia Cruz, Harlem Stage's executive director, views ''Makandal'' as an opportunity to attract new financers and producing partners for the organization, which has an annual operating budget of around $3 million. And between the upheaval in Egypt, immigration debates and the fallout over the killing of Trayvon Martin, she said the times were right to use the escaped slave and rebel Fran&ccedil;ois Makandal to explore questions about immigration, race and liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is super-ambitious,'' Ms. Cruz said of the project. ''In order to advance our work and the artists we present, we need to do more -- not just in the Harlem community or just in New York.'' She said the opera form allows its creators ''to mix the mythic, the historic and contemporary tragedies with the idea of hope and the idea of change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Makandal'' was five years in the making. It was conceived and written by Carl Hancock Rux, who is also a performance artist. His work includes the play ''Talk,'' and he originated the title role in Robert Wilson and Bernice Johnson Reagon's opera, ''The Temptation of St. Anthony.'' The director is Lars Jan, a genre-bending media artist. Jazz, classical and traditional Afro-Cuban music ripple through the score, written by Yosvany Terry, a composer born in Cuba. Edouard Duval-Carri&eacute;, the visual designer whose politically charged art is featured in the opera, was born in Port-au-Prince.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With nine actors (all trained singers) playing multiple roles, ''Makandal'' also tells the contemporary story of a boatload of Cuban, Dominican and Haitian immigrants embarking on a boat ride to a better life. It is a layered story: In the center is the tale of Makandal, a slave who escapes a Haitian plantation, hides out in the hills, leads a group of revolutionaries plotting an overthrow of colonial powers and is captured and burned alive at the stake in the public square in Cap-Ha&iuml;tien in 1758. ''Makandal'' is not strictly biographical, though, as it shifts between myth and reality, the past and the present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harlem Stage officials say the opera project is well on its way. Performance spaces in both South Africa and Haiti are in the pipeline, although Ms. Cruz declined to name them. A ''Making Makandal'' marketing and fund-raising campaign will begin in September, with events like films, readings and concerts leading up to the premiere, for which no date has been set. One-third of the approximately $750,000 needed has already been raised from individual donors, corporations and foundations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I think it's within their capacity,'' said Sandra L. Gibson, an arts consultant and former president of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, with 2,000 members worldwide. ''These global cultural exchanges are not just the province of larger institutions. We found from our research that three-fourths of the field has been engaged in global cultural exchange. The size of your entity is not a factor; it was your community, your interest, your mission and your capacity to do this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little downside to ''Makandal'' even if it does not reach all of its goals, said Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the founder of the center's DeVos Institute of Arts Management. ''The next time, you come back with a different project,'' Mr. Kaiser said, building a reputation that does not rely on one hit or miss but a steady series of exciting ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Rux, the opera grew out of his three-year residency at what is now called the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County, which started in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of interviews with Haitians and Cubans led him to the story of Makandal, an escaped slave from a sugar plantation who led the failed revolt. According to myth, Makandal developed wings and flew away upon his execution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Macdonnell, a former artistic director of the Miami center, initially approached Harlem Stage to become a partner in producing ''Makandal,'' Mr. Rux recalled. Harlem Stage eventually became the sole producer when the Miami center went through a restructuring and dropped out, but the Miami group will receive a co-commissioning credit because of its involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Makandal host committee, assembled to drum up support and interest in the project includes Donna Karan and the novelist Edwidge Danticat, who is from Haiti. Rosemonde Pierre-Louis, the deputy Manhattan borough president who is of Haitian descent, attended a recent ''Makandal'' preview to interest the news media and underwriters. ''Makandal is such an important and endearing figure for Haitians,'' Ms. Pierre-Louis said in an interview. ''In Haiti, this will be embraced. Securing the venue will not be an issue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jan, the director, whose multimedia performance ''Abacus'' will be presented at the 2014 Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, called the project ''huge and complicated.'' He said he was especially intrigued by the challenge of staging an opera in varied locations, even one with a six-member musical ensemble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''How do we bring it to Haiti, first and foremost?'' Mr. Jan asked. ''How do we keep it flexible enough with a light enough footprint to create it elsewhere? Can we come up with a lighting design that doesn't rely on a grid? Or how do we have a video, sound or lighting design not attached to the power requirements of a venue like Harlem Stage? Is there a way to scale the performance to different sizes of venues, indoors and outdoors?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, Plan B is to scale back if enough money cannot be raised, or there are technical problems in mounting the full production, Ms. Cruz said. But Harlem Stage managed to raise $750,000 in less than a year in 2010 to match a grant and support staff and operating costs, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can find five people to write $100,000 checks for this project if I have to,'' Ms. Cruz said. ''This will happen, one way or another.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William C. Thompson Jr., the sole African-American in this year's New York City mayoral contest, rarely talks about race. In a city of flame-throwing orators, he has long favored a political path of conciliation over confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Sunday, Mr. Thompson arrived before a mostly black congregation in a storefront church and issued a fierce denunciation of the policies of the New York Police Department, saying they are drawn from the same racial suspicions that drove George Zimmerman to hunt down Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Here in New York City, we have institutionalized Mr. Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to treat young black and Latino men with suspicion, to stop them and frisk them because of the color of their skin,'' Mr. Thompson said at the Abundant Life Church in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks, which were unusually soaring, provocative and personal, arrived at a crucial moment in the campaign: despite Mr. Thompson's presence in the race, black voters, sounding notes of forgiveness, have been strikingly receptive to the candidacy of former Congressman Anthony D. Weiner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr. Weiner's campaign now reeling from new revelations about his online sexual encounters with women, Mr. Thompson needs to win over those African-Americans and turn them out in large numbers to prevail in the race to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advisers to Mr. Thompson have suggested that voters in minority neighborhoods may make up their minds late in a campaign, and, in the final stretch of the race, he will make a major push to secure their embrace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. Thompson first took the plexiglass lectern at the squat church filled with folding chairs shortly after 11 a.m., he acknowledged that delving into the sensitive subject of race was ''not my first or natural instinct.'' But he proceeded to put forth the most assertive address of the campaign on the polarizing issue of stop and frisk, a tactic heralded by the city's police as a lifesaving deterrent and assailed by a generation of black and Latino men as overused and abusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of what Mr. Thompson said were the 600,000 blacks and Latinos stopped by the New York police in 2011, a vast majority were innocent, he said -- ''profiled as Trayvon was profiled.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''If our government profiles people because of skin color and treats them as potential criminals, how can we expect citizens to do any less?'' Mr. Thompson asked, as church members loudly applauded and occasionally interrupted with cries of ''amen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For black voters unsettled by the Bloomberg era of law enforcement, Mr. Thompson occupies an intriguing place in the campaign. He has defended elements of the stop-and-frisk policy as effective and stops short of the call to abolish it advocated by a Democratic rival, John C. Liu, the city comptroller, positions that have earned Mr. Thompson the support of major police unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he has made clear he would replace the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, overhaul the stop-and-frisk strategy to ban racial profiling, and limit reliance on the practice by hiring 2,000 more officers and putting more experienced ones in high-crime areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, though, he talked about the issues in human terms, as a father and a husband. Mr. Thompson, the son of a Democratic judge in State Supreme Court and a schoolteacher, acknowledged that his biography did not put him in the same shoes as many black and Latino men across the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am the son of the struggle before me,'' he said. ''And although it has not ended, I have lived in the blessing of its success so far.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, invoking the ''dreams of our fathers'' and ''dreams for our sons,'' he said he felt compelled to speak out after the acquittal of Mr. Zimmerman. ''When the rules of society -- that we call and honor as the law -- allow even one of those dreams to be snuffed out in anger and fear without consequence or action, those rules fail us all,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the church, where the mostly black congregants said they had anticipated a tepid speech from another politician, there was a mixture of surprise and admiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I wasn't expecting that at all,'' said Karen Khan, 52, who teaches middle school in Brooklyn, and had never known Mr. Thompson to talk about race. ''I thought it was going to be one of those speeches designed to pacify the issue. Sweep it under the rug -- O.K., let's move on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several said in interviews that the speech had compelled them to re-evaluate his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He would get my vote based on the passion in his speech today,'' said Khalid Douglas, 33, a structural engineer. ''It improved my opinion of him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Thompson the speech was a departure not just in tone, but in style. He spoke about ''a chorus of common dreams'' and ''the stubborn stain of enduring racism.'' He described the emotional experience of watching President Obama discuss the George Zimmerman verdict, ''stripped of that power, not as president, but as the black man he is, I am, and we will always be.'' He wondered what moved this ''dignified, calm, thoughtful man'' to speak, almost sounding as if he could be referring to himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson said he had endured criticism ''from people I know and trust and respect'' for declaring, after Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal, that Mr. Martin was killed because of his skin color. But he reiterated that belief again on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Trayvon&nbsp;Martin did die because he was black. Of that, there is no doubt,'' Mr. Thompson said, adding, ''The verdict in Florida was a verdict -- but it was not the verdict.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20-minute address will not be the last appeal to minorities, who, for the first time, are expected to make up a majority of the New York City electorate this season, starting with the Sept. 10 primary. Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, has showcased his interracial family (he married an African-American) while Christine C. Quinn is targeting black and Latino women, and the city's comptroller, Mr. Liu, is talking up his immigrant roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Democratic field where substantive differences can seem reed-thin, voters are especially attuned to the candidates' passion and message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaving church on Sunday, Ms. Khan said Mr. Thompson's thoughtfulness ''pushed me closer to saying 'Hmm, now it's a tossup between him and Bill de Blasio, because Bill de Blasio is very outspoken, too.' ''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayoral hopeful Bill Thompson (left) yesterday compared the NYPD's use of stop-and-frisk to the racial profiling that led to the tragic killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The analogy, regarding the shooting of 17-year-old Martin by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman, was Thompson's strongest criticism of the stop-and-frisk tactic to date. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Here in New York City, we have institutionalized Mr. Zimmerman's suspicion with a policy that all but requires our police officers to treat young black and Latino men with suspicion, to stop them and frisk them because of the color of their skin . . . profiled as Trayvon was profiled,&quot; Thompson said in a speech at a Brooklyn churcg. &quot;If our government profiles people because of skin color and treats them as potential criminals, how can we expect citizens to do any less?&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before yesterday's stop-and-frisk statement, Thompson, the lone black candidate for mayor, has garnered criticism from activists - including the Rev. Al Sharpton - for not standing firmly against the controversial NYPD practice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While he has been somewhat critical of the implementation of stop-and-frisk, Thompson didn't support either of the two City Council bills that are aimed at restricting the practice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, he's insisted a change in leadership of the city in January would resolve the issue. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protect Volusia's wetlands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm writing about the story, &quot;Proposed wetlands-rule changes stir flak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, my husband and I moved from &quot;up north&quot; to Port Orange. The word &quot;paradise&quot; kept coming to mind because of the surrounding beauty. Unfortunately, now the lines from &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; -- &quot;They paved paradise and put up a parkin' lot&quot; -- come more to mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Florida State of the Environment -- Wetlands: A Guide to Living with Florida's Wetlands&quot; is an excellent documentation of the enormous value of wetlands. Volusia County Councilman Doug Daniels believes existing rules are &quot;overprotective&quot; of unproductive low- quality wetlands. When I studied Environmental Policy at Tufts University, every wetland was productive and necessary. As Councilwoman Pat Northey believes, changing current wetland protection is &quot;an assault on our 30-year legacy of good environmental stewardship.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daniels and partisanship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all should be pleased with the appointment of Doug Daniels as an e-zone consultant to the city of Daytona Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being a Democrat, it was clear that the Republicans were only interested in attacking the appointment because of his party affiliation. I'm certainly on board with that thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Daniels' selection by the Democrat-controlled Daytona Beach city government was clearly the only option available, and the no-bid appointment was totally justified. This surely is a brilliant decision that all Democrats applaud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why should the Republicans be concerned about the ethics of another no-bid deal? It only pays &quot;$125 per hour, up to $125,000,&quot; and I'm confident that Daniels will be sure to spend every hour working hard and won't work even one hour beyond that $125,000 limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh my, I hope the other work of his law firm won't be disrupted and that other work representing his district on the Volusia County Council can be worked in. Maybe those other jobs can be worked on weekends or after the $125,000 limit is reached. Of course, it will be best for all of us to have Daniels working as an insider on the County Council for all those development interests that he'll be focusing on now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's just too bad that those darn Republicans will ask him to not vote on any of those development concerns requiring council involvement. I suspect, though, that Daniels will usually get his way on those votes. Daniels knows a few Democrats on the County Council too, and that certainly will be a help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congratulations to Daniels and our Democrat leaders. What a great system we have here, and those darn Republicans just ought to quit trying to interfere.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflict almost inevitable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because conflicts of interests are unavoidable, I believe County Councilman Doug Daniels should resign from his position as a paid (up to $125,000) e-zone consultant to the Daytona Beach City Commission. You can not serve two masters (or three).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that Daniels should decide whether to serve as the elected Volusia County Council representative, or serve the Daytona Beach City Commission. This situation should have been averted. Keep it simple, nonpolitical and transparent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch shouldn't be armed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, our media has done a masterful job of creating an issue that directs our attention and needed concern away from a very real problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest example of what I'm talking about is, of course, the Martin/Zimmerman tragedy. Not one person involved with the legalities of this case, to include the jury, has ever perceived this as a racial issue. More importantly, not one person who actually knows George Zimmerman has even hinted that he might be a racist. Since these facts do not support the media's agenda, which is to sell papers and gain viewers, they have gotten very little exposure. I'm actually surprised that the media has not found a way to somehow link Paula Deen to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people are sincerely sickened by what took place in Sanford and want to do something meaningful that might actually help prevent future such tragedies, I suggest we direct our energies to marching in protest against the ridiculous law that allows &quot;community watch/ citizens patrol&quot; types to carry loaded weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I honestly believe that if George Zimmerman was not armed with a loaded gun, he would never have gotten close enough to Trayvon to be involved in any type of altercation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">From 'Aggressive' Trayvon to 'Laid-Back' Dzhokhar - Marijuana's Changing Image</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">941  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aside from having regularly smoked marijuana, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Trayvon Martin share little in common. Tsarnaev, of course, is the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings and Martin was the unarmed black teenager shot to death in Florida in 2012 by a man who claims he felt threatened by him. But differences in the way the media have covered their cannabis use portend a major shift in public attitudes about the drug, as well as a troubling reminder of the racism that still largely prevents us from seeing drugs as a health issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the judge in the Martin case said his accused killer, George Zimmerman, may not use evidence related to the victim's past marijuana use in his defense. As the New York Times put it: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark O'Mara, Mr. Zimmerman's lawyer, argued that Mr. Martin's drug use could have made him aggressive and paranoid, which the defense said might have prompted him to attack Mr. Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood-watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an argument is contradicted by medical evidence, which shows that marijuana tends to reduce aggression. Nonetheless, the fact that metabolites of the cannabis were found in Martin's blood made national headlines when it was first made public. The blood test was generally seen as discrediting the victim. As his mother told the media at the time, &quot;They've killed my son, and now they're trying to kill his reputation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, while the marijuana-related evidence was only part of a huge trove of data released, it received most of the attention. From ABC News to TIME to Rush Limbaugh, the fact that Martin had smoked pot some time in the days or weeks before the killing was seen as potentially helpful to his killer's case that his victim had been up to no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now let's consider the media's take on the weed habit of the man suspected of carrying out the worst act of terrorism on American soil since 9/11. Here's how a high school friend, widely quoted in the media, described him to the New Yorker's David Remnick:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He was a cool guy,' Ashraful Rahman said. 'I never got any bad vibes from him. He wasn't a star student, but he was smart ... It's so out of character. And you have to remember - he was a stoner. He was really into marijuana. And generally guys like that are very calm, cool.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how the Times described him, in an article headlined, &quot;The Dark Side, Carefully Masked&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To even his closest friends, Mr. Tsarnaev was a smart, athletic 19-year-old with a barbed wit and a laid-back demeanor, fond of soccer and parties, all too fond of marijuana. They seldom, if ever, saw his second, almost watertight life: his disintegrating family, his overbearing brother, the gathering blackness in his most private moments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USA Today put it this way:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends and classmates of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can't grasp how the pot-smoking party boy they knew is the same young man now accused of carrying out a terrorist attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Politico described Tsarnaev as being &quot;more interested in blunts than bombs&quot; and quoted a friend as saying he was a &quot;normal pothead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, rather than portraying Tsarnaev's marijuana use as a sign of his criminality, it is presented as a reason not to suspect him - a signal that he's &quot;one of us,&quot; not some unknowable monster. The New York Times actually lists marijuana use as one of his &quot;light side&quot; characteristics, not as a harbinger of other criminal acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What can account for these differences? The most obvious factor is race: Martin was black and Tsarnaev is white, and our educational and justice systems certainly treat drug use by those two groups rather differently. In white kids, marijuana use is typically dismissed as relatively harmless youthful experimentation - in blacks, it's a reason for arrest and suspension from school. Black youths are arrested for drug crimes at a rate 10 times higher than whites, despite research finding that whites are equally or more likely to take or sell drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor may be public perceptions about terrorism. Because of the connection to religious radicalism in the Tsarnaev case, marijuana smoking might be seen as more mitigating because radical Muslims are forbidden from drinking and using drugs. However, the 9/11 terrorists drank and attended strip clubs before their attacks, so this explanation is not necessarily plausible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more important influence, I believe, is timing. Since the Martin case became national news in February 2012, two states, Colorado and Washington, have legalized recreational use of marijuana. National polls show continually growing support for ending marijuana prohibition, a position now taken by a majority of Americans. The younger the age group, the greater the pro-legalization majority, suggesting that in the long run, change is highly likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These shifts meant that by the time the bombings occurred in April, a major re-examination of marijuana had occurred. The media, which generally attempts to mirror public sentiment, did not want to seem out of touch by making an issue of Tsarnaev's marijuana use. Reporters and editors recognized that a drug that half the adult population has tried is unlikely to be a key driver of terrorism. (Other than, ironically, by financing it through illegal trade, which appears to have been directly the case with the Tsarnaev brothers, at least one of whom apparently sold the drug.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, virtually the only nonironic media attention given to the idea that marijuana could have caused the bombings was an op-ed arguing for drug testing, written by a former antidrug official who runs a drug-testing company and once testified in court that even irregular use of marijuana signifies addiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preachers who came before Martin said he and Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, had become &quot;parents to teenagers across America&quot; in the year since George Zimmerman killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford. But Tracy Martin said that outside the presence of the cameras, when he is alone at night, he is simply a man who falls on his knees and prays about the loss of his son and the recent acquittal of the man who he believes murdered him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the greatest gifts God can give a man is a son,&quot; Martin said. &quot;I lost my son, but I'm here to make sure that you don't lose yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That statement brought cheers from the crowd of hundreds who gathered to hear Martin at a rally and fundraiser for the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters and several other local politicians and clergymen urged the crowd to channel their outrage over Zimmerman's acquittal into civic activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What will make hell mad and Tallahassee nervous is when we develop strategy to go with our anger,&quot; Bishop Harold Calvin Ray said. Martin sat stoically as the speakers before him criticized prosecutors in his son's murder case and called for a repeal or amendment to Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. But he cheered along with the crowd as Ray said Zimmerman had no right to disobey a dispatcher's order and homeowner association rules before he took out a gun and shot Martin at the end of a brief struggle. Martin also stood and clapped as three teens about his son's age performed a dance to the Gospel song &quot;Encourage Yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of the rally asked the crowd to sign several petitions Sunday night -- including one calling for the federal government to pursue civil rights violations charges against Zimmerman. Masters called two 17-year-old boys to read the petition as a symbol of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's age when he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin referenced that in his short speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the month since the U.S. Supreme Court struck a key portion of the Voting Rights Act, state and federal officials and civil rights groups across the country have jumped into the legal void the ruling created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida officials last week vowed to immediately restart a purge of voter rolls. In Texas, the Justice Department asked a federal court to use a part of the act left intact to require the state to obtain federal approval before redistricting or putting other voting changes in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the NAACP and the Urban League over the past two weeks have pledged to make it an immediate priority to get Congress to update the seminal portion of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court tossed out. The way to do that, leaders at the groups' conventions said, is to build a record detailing state and local changes to precinct locations, early voting times and redistricting that they believe could make it harder for blacks or Hispanics to vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need you to be our eyes and ears,&quot; Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told more than 3,000 at the NAACP's national convention in Orlando, calling the June 25 Supreme Court decision a day of infamy. &quot;If there's any proposed change in your jurisdiction, if you see something that looks and smells like it's discriminatory and just appears it might be, call us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court's 5-4 ruling threw out the part of the Voting Rights Act that determined which states and jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, including five counties in Florida, required Justice Department review before voting law changes could take effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system was &quot;based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day,&quot; Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling spurred states including Texas and South Carolina to move forward with newly drawn districts or voter ID requirements that had been rejected or put on hold because of the federal oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, the decision caused a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Mi Familia Vota on behalf of two Hispanic voters against a purge from voter rolls of non-citizens instituted last year by Gov. Rick Scott. The lawsuit hinged on the Voting Rights Act because federal officials had not approved the purge in five Florida counties -- Hillsborough, Hardee, Hendry, Collier and Monroe -- as the law required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics, including county elections supervisors, said the purge targeted voters with Hispanic-sounding surnames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voter purge resumes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the judge dismissed the lawsuit Thursday and lifted a hold on the purge, Secretary of State Ken Detzner's office said Florida would resume it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic U.S. Reps. Alcee Hastings of Miramar and Ted Deutch of Boca Raton plus state Sen. Arthenia Joyner of Tampa urged Scott to abandon the purge, which used faulty data and flagged some voters who had become naturalized citizens or who were even born in the U.S. Detzner has since gained access to a federal Homeland Security database he believes will make the list more accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than move forward with a flawed voter purge and make up the law as you go along, it is time to work with leaders throughout Florida to chart out a rational, legal and accountable process for voter registration and voter roll maintenance in our state,&quot; Hastings and Deutch wrote to Scott on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil and voting rights lawyers and activists consider the Voting Rights Act a powerful tool to prevent discrimination at the polls and to preserve minorities' electoral influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say the federal oversight eliminated by the ruling allowed the Justice Department to block discriminatory laws and practices and helped increase minority registration and turnout. The parts of the law intact after the ruling must be settled in court -- and after potentially discriminatory practices are in effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building case for law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue will be front-and-center at an Aug. 24 Washington march organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton commemorating the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s &quot;I Have a Dream Speech&quot; speech. Sharpton has a show on the liberal news network, MSNBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is under attack is not just the right of blacks to vote but the entire social justice infrastructure,&quot; the Rev. Jesse Jackson said during a voting rights panel discussion at the NAACP convention in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, compared the Supreme Court ruling to the 1896 &quot;separate but equal&quot; federal doctrine that justified racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Supreme Court has declared war on the African-American community,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to show that the African-American community will not stand for this travesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creating a record to document to Congress the need to re-enact the law could take months and would likely require study of legislation, policies and voters' experiences since at least 2006, when Congress reauthorized the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional hearings on the issue began July 17, amid pressure to build a new basis for the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to be sure that there is as complete a record as possible, in order to make sure that the best groundwork has been laid for legislation that is introduced and hopefully adopted,&quot; said Bob Kengle, co-director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law's Voting Rights Project, who testified before a House committee July 18. The Lawyers Committee was part of Florida's lawsuit challenging the voter purge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local reports will help build the case for the law, NAACP Legal Defense Fund Executive Director Elaine Jones said. While the court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, dealing with which jurisdictions require oversight, it left intact Section 5, which gives the Justice Department authority to oversee election law changes in covered areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means Congress has to re-establish the need for oversight either in those same jurisdictions or other jurisdictions before the government can use Section 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 4 is &quot;the keys&quot; to the law and Section 5 is &quot;the automobile,&quot; Jones said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They left the automobile but they took the keys,&quot; she said. &quot;We have to retool the lock and we've got to give it a new mechanism and we've got to give it a new tamper-free lock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fla. 2012 vote cited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics point to the 2012 election in Florida as a prime example of the need for federal oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters in some areas, including Palm Beach County, waited in line more than eight hours to cast their ballots in 2012 after a 2011 law shortened the early voting period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2011 law also did away with early voting on the Sunday before Election Day, known as &quot;souls to the polls&quot; because many black churchgoers cast their ballots after attending services since Florida began early voting in 2004. The 2011 law also required people who moved from one county to another to cast provisional ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami-Dade County elections officials failed to update precincts after redistricting and voters in some precincts dominated by minorities were forced to wait in long lines because of a shortage of election equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida lawmakers this year reversed parts of the 2011 law and gave local supervisors the choice of holding from eight to 14 days of early voting, expanding early voting sites and lengthening hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because the problems were so widespread and went beyond the counties requiring Justice Department scrutiny, some want Congress to consider putting the entire state under federal review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have documentation that, just in the 2012 election, how the state of Florida tried to suppress the vote,&quot; said Cynthia Slater, Florida NAACP director of civic engagement. &quot;It was alive and it still bears witness to the effects of what's happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building a congressional record to support those changes will take time. And many observers are skeptical that Congress, unable to reach consensus on other major issues, will act before next year's mid-term elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, civil rights groups are using the 2012 election problems and the recent Trayvon Martin shooting case to ramp up voter registration efforts, convinced that their best hope of a new law depends on electing officials who support their cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your greatest voice is at the ballot box. I think this will raise the awareness that people need to actually get out and make their voices heard,&quot; Slater said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TO STU Bykofsky: I want to commend you on your column regarding the reaction to the Zimmerman verdict. You are one of the few in the media who have the guts to point out that it is ridiculous to blame the white man for the genocide of black males that is going on in the inner cities, like our own Philadelphia.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To see the hucksters like the Rev. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and the NAACP use the media and the race card to their benefit in this case, and not get called on it is a disgrace. I am waiting for someone in the media to ask the following question: Why are black males profiled? The media is taking political correctness to an extreme and is cowardly, in my opinion. As you point out, it is much more likely that a black man will be murdered by a black male than a white or Hispanic town-watch representative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If real leaders come forward and stress the family unit, fatherhood, education and honest work, they might have some hope. Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be any time in the near future. It is time for people in that community to take responsibility instead of blaming others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, if the media continues to enable the likes of Sharpton, Jesse, and the NAACP, the racial divide will become deeper and the real issue in the black community will continue in the form of dead black males. The Trayvon Martin death was a tragedy for the Martin family, but it does not indicate that the white man is the greatest danger to black males. Thank you for keeping it real. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">573 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Detroit Free Press - 45 minutes ago - The Detroit City Council unanimously passed a resolution today calling for a federal investigation to see whether civil rights charges are warranted against George Zimmerman, who was acquitted July 13 of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the killing of Florida teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aforementioned was a top news story on AOL when I opened my computer to write this week's column, a commentary in which I intended to focus on the economic roots of Detroit becoming the largest city in American history to file for bankruptcy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Kenneth Cockrel Jr. voted for the resolution but added this comment: &quot;We need to have that same level of outrage with respect to the black-on-black crime that takes place in our community. How many people were shot - maybe even shot and killed this past weekend in the city - most likely by folks who look just like them.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And shot and killed, Cockrel could have added, accurately, by folks who look more like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin than George Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit was the deadliest city last year among the nation's top 20 most populous cities, measured in the number of murders per 100,000 citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit also is the nation's most black-American city. In its January 2012 report, &quot;Black History Month: February 2012,&quot; the Census Bureau reported that 84.3 percent of Detroit's population was black in 2010, &quot;which is the highest percentage nationally among places with populations of 100,000 or more.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit had 411 murders in 2012, up 11 percent from 2011. New York, in contrast, with a population more than 11 times larger than the population of Detroit, had 414 murders in 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much attention now is being paid to &quot;the economic disaster that is Detroit,&quot; recently wrote Jack Lessenberry, a political analyst at Michigan Radio and a professor of journalism at Wayne State University. &quot;But there is another horrendous crisis destroying Detroit that we don't talk about. Black people are killing black people at a horrendous rate, and nobody seems sufficiently concerned.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chief Logan knows a lot about violence,&quot; wrote Lessenberry, referring to Detroit's black interim chief of police. &quot;His own brother was shot to death in Detroit in 1968, when Logan was serving in Vietnam. Last year, the chief's nephew was gunned down at his job at a Detroit barber shop.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accumulated numbers are astounding. &quot;Since Logan joined the force in 1969, the chief estimates 15,000 black men have been killed in the city,&quot; reports Lessenberry. &quot;To put this in perspective, more people were murdered in Detroit last year than our nation lost fighting in Afghanistan.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the dead were young black males. &quot;Our children, our young men are dying like dogs in the street and it seems like we're passing it by,&quot; Logan told a gathering of people who've lost family and friends to violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief said he was angry because everyone knows about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin but not about the thousands of dead in Detroit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asked: &quot;Why isn't there the same rage when we do it? Our civil rights organizations didn't speak out. You didn't see Al Sharpton come here. Why? Why don't we make the next civil rights movement the reduction of black-on-black violence in our major cities? That should be almost our singular focus - to stop this madness.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a few days ago, Samantha Power, President Obama's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, surely didn't expect to stir up the proverbial hornet's nest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power told the committee that as America's U.N. envoy, she believed in contesting what she described as a crackdown on civil society being carried out in countries like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was truthful, if not exactly an exercise in delicate diplomacy, and it enraged Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro, the hand-picked successor of the late Hugo Chavez, the flamboyantly anti-American  socialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power says she'll fight repression in Venezuela? What repression? There is repression in the United States, where they kill African-Americans with impunity, and where they hunt the youngster Edward Snowden just for telling the truth, declared Maduro with Chavez-like embellishment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He demanded an apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such nonsense. The Trayvon Martin case was decided in a court of law. Snowden is being pursued for revealing classified material that could jeopardize the country's security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduro, a former bus driver who was elected in April after Chavez succumbed to cancer, had called for improved relations with Washington. In June his foreign minister, Elias Jaua, met Secretary of State John Kerry, who described their meeting as the beginning of a good, respectful relationship. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaua announced that his government had sent a letter of protest to the American embassy in Caracas. In it, he said, he asked if there is still willingness in Washington to improve relations. He bragged of Venezuela's solid system of constitutional guarantees and blasted the United States' repressive practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduro earlier angered Washington by offering asylum to Snowden, the fugitive intelligence contractor who has been stranded in a Moscow airport while seeking a home where he'd avoid prosecution by the United States. All but two - Venezuela and Nicaragua - rejected his request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He decided to offer asylum to Snowden, Maduro explained, to protect this young man from the persecution unleashed by the world's most powerful empire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this is reminiscent of Chavez's hyperbole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States needn't overreact to Maduro's bravado, but it needn't apologize for Power's accurate characterization of Venezuela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We suspect all this will fade away. Despite the ill will generated by Chavez, the United States remains a critical trading partner for Venezuela. And the United States is a major importer of Venezuela's major export, oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduro's tough talk probably is no more than that. In any event, such threats shouldn't keep American diplomats from calling out oppressive regimes, however thin-skinned they may be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activist stir pot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is indeed tragic when a young person dies. But hatemongering, death threats and race-baiting are just as tragic. Our president famously said, &quot;Let's not jump to conclusions,&quot; when a Muslim terrorist cried, &quot;Allah is Great&quot; as he shot dozens of people at Fort Hood. He refused to call the Boston bombing &quot;Muslim terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama wasted no time, however, jumping to conclusions about the George Zimmerman trial in Sanford, Fla., where I was born and raised. He said, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&quot; Does he now support mob rule? Does he side with the Black Panthers who have put a price on Zimmerman's head? Did he hear all the evidence as the jurors did? Zimmerman may have used poor judgment in following Martin, but that is no crime. The instigator was Martin, who jumped on Zimmerman and bashed his head into the sidewalk. That is a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal media and black activists always seem to show up to stir the racial pot whenever a non-black kills a black person, no matter the circumstance. Hundreds of black men are killed every year in Detroit, Philadelphia and Chicago by other black men. Where is the outcry? My question is, if Martin had killed Zimmerman by bashing his head into the sidewalk one too many times, would Obama still be saying, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps I am na&iuml;ve or ignorant, but I don't believe most people care what color a person's skin is. What matters is one's speech, actions and character. That is what Martin Luther King wanted. To the black activists of today, however, everything is based upon the color of one's skin. And that is racism, which King fought against his whole life. With racial harmony, the activists of today would have no job, nor would they have a voice. So to the detriment of society they continue to stir the pot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We live near S.W. 12th Street and Fairlawn Road and are being invaded by coyotes. I saw three in our yard recently, and a neighbor lady saw five or six a couple of days later, also in our yard. Another coyote was seen on our street, and a driver saw one crossing Fairlawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is rather interesting to think of seeing and hearing them here in the city, and I love to hear them howl at night. It reminds me of living in the country. But cats or small dogs that are allowed to run loose could easily become a meal for a coyote. They have mostly been seen at night, but they do move around during the daytime, too. So please, keep your pets penned up or inside.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had high hopes about this summer being cooler than previous years and reducing my electric bill. However, along comes Westar Energy to dash any hopes that I can ever do anything whatsoever to control my energy costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish I could get a raise as often as Westar seems to be able to. I can't remember the last time I saw a Westar truck that wasn't new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe Westar Energy has a money Jones that we can no longer afford to support. But since most of us can't afford to support Kansas politicians, likely we'll pay more to a company that can afford to donate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hip-hop star Jay-Z and his wife, Beyonc&eacute;, have rallied in support of Trayvon Martin's family after the controversial acquittal of George Zimmerman for killing the unarmed teenager. Other music stars might be considering joining Stevie Wonder's campaign to boycott states with &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While artists should be commended for their political and social activism, helping to improve the long-term economic viability of their young black fans could have lasting and tangible impact. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hip-hop stars have tremendous influence on their fans. Young admirers embrace the genre, and many aspire to the rappers' extravagant lifestyle. Fans spend millions on hip-hop fashion and buy expensive beverages promoted in songs and videos. While not necessarily an outcome to applaud, the adoption of a hip-hop sensibility indicates that rappers can also influence young blacks to move beyond being aspirational consumers to inspirational entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Magic touch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge is getting more artists to view their economic impact on music as an opportunity to extend their financial clout to the broader community. Former basketball star Magic Johnson made the transition and is transforming urban America by creating businesses and jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rappers can, too. But they have to see themselves as 21st century entrepreneurs, as comfortable speaking in corporate boardrooms as they are spitting lyrics on stage, as interested in owning businesses as they are in buying expensive homes far removed from the communities they rap about. They have to understand their nexus between the little boys in the neighborhood and the big boys on Wall Street, and make investments in their young African-American fans eager for success but clueless about how to get there. Few youngsters will become platinum-level rappers, but lots can own businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Follow the Master</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Master P, an entrepreneur, gets it. &quot;Most guys get into this business to be hard-core,&quot; he told Black Enterprise magazine. &quot;I'm in this to show people that we could come from nothing and still be able to deal with corporate America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I witnessed the sway these artists have during the 2008 presidential campaign when I was an adviser to Barack Obama's presidential campaign and coordinated the involvement of artists and athletes. Young people responded and voted enthusiastically, energized by their hip-hop heroes and the prospect of a youthful black president who listened to hip-hop himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political engagement is vital for keeping young people from being marginalized from the rest of society, but it's even more imperative to keep them from being further disenfranchised from the larger economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black joblessness abounds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black unemployment rate stands at 13.7%; for black youth it's 43.6%. Only 52% of black male students graduate from high school in four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they aren't graduating, they aren't going to college or getting the best jobs. For some, their education is as limited as their outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some can recite lyrics of rap songs but can't balance a checkbook. They write rhymes but can't write a cover letter. Education and entrepreneurship can lead to a more promising future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hip-hop music generates more than $10 billion annually, and the top 20 rappers earned more than $271 million a year.  While Jay-Z, Diddy, Russell Simmons and Dr. Dre can impressively sell millions of albums, it's their entrepreneurial skills that should be applauded and emulated by young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay-Z has created a record label, fragrance and clothing lines, and Roc Nation Sports; Samsung purchased and provided 1 million digital versions of his new album Magna Carta Holy Grail to Galaxy phone users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Jay-Z rapped: &quot;I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man,&quot; he was speaking truth to power.  Jay-Z and others can help young people live out that line by creating more businesses and jobs for their fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can invest in high-growth companies such as energy, technology and advanced manufacturing. They can support job training initiatives and programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics so that young people can be prepared for the jobs of the future. Artists can also encourage companies whose products they endorse to locate manufacturing and distribution facilities in hard-hit urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annual awards shows, such as BET's and MTV's, should present an &quot;Entrepreneur and Job Creator of the Year&quot; award. Not only would it change the way young people view rappers, it also would show that rappers are providing a return to their investors -- those who buy the albums, tickets and apparel that keep them in business in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick C. Wade was senior adviser and deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Commerce Department. He is currently an entrepreneur and global business consultant. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOX ISLAND, Wash. - On a recent afternoon, Kent Holder drove his Ford pickup, emblazoned with &quot;Citizens' Patrol&quot; magnetic decals, through this leafy enclave west of Tacoma, Wash., recalling when he learned that George Zimmerman had shot and killed an unarmed teenager - and was a neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thought, 'Boy, did he ever screw up,' &quot; said Holder, 74, a retired firefighter and five-year neighborhood patrol veteran. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Holder's view, Zimmerman violated two basic tenets of the watch program: Never confront a person you perceive to be suspicious, and never carry a weapon while on duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 13, a jury in Sanford, Fla., acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, 17. The case has focused news attention on civilian patrols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, spotted Martin, who was black, as the unarmed teenager walked to the home of his father's fiancee from a convenience store. Zimmerman thought Martin looked suspicious and called the police. The two had a confrontation, and Martin was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Sheriffs' Association's neighborhood watch program was established in 1972 to combat a spike in suburban and rural burglaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was designed to empower civilians to act as &quot;the eyes and ears of law enforcement&quot; without taking matters into their own hands, said John Thompson, who directs the initiative. The association's 37-page manual says that patrol members &quot;shall not carry weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the group is seen as an authority, fewer than one-third of the estimated 90,000 neighborhood watch groups nationwide have registered with it, said Thompson. Zimmerman's watch group was not among those registered, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could show you 50 groups with 50 different sets of rules,&quot; Thompson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the trial, Wendy Dorival, a civilian with the Sanford Police Department, testified that she trained Zimmerman on neighborhood watch protocol, advising him to avoid initiating confrontations. It was not clear whether she counseled him on whether to carry a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barring guns from civilian patrols is a legal gray area since most U.S. citizens have the right to bear arms, said Kenneth Novak, a criminologist at the University of Missouri at Kansas City who has studied watch programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local watch groups, as private entities, are on relatively firm legal ground in setting no-weapons policies for their members, Novak said, but law enforcement agencies mandating such rules could run the risk of exceeding their authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People participating in neighborhood watch enjoy all the legal protections under the Constitution, as well as state and federal law,&quot; he said. &quot;That can include carrying a weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffrey Dehan, a sergeant who advises neighborhood watch groups as part of his duties with the Thurston County Sheriff's Office in Washington state, says it is not their role to offer guidance on whether members should carry a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't advocate 'should or shouldn't,' &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carmen Caldwell, the executive director of Citizens' Crime Watch of Miami-Dade in Florida, said that in the wake of the Zimmerman case, some trainers were considering new safeguards, which could include background checks on prospective members and teaching about racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, the former firefighter from Washington, said fallout from the Martin shooting has been minimal. &quot;There was concern that we would've had something negative from it,&quot; he said. &quot;But nobody has ever said, 'You guys shouldn't be out here.' They love us. They love having us.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 29--YORK, Pa. -- Eric Kirkland approached a group of people sitting in a York park and knocked on an empty chair like it was a door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good afternoon, good afternoon,&quot; he said. &quot;How is everybody?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wanted their help with a project -- to preserve the stories of a generation of black families that moved to York decades ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been collecting a lot of pictures and stuff from back in the day,&quot; said the 60-year-old Kirkland. &quot;But we have so much history that we don't have recorded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorothy Sweeney, 79, told him her name. One of her children added that the maiden name was Hawkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkland was surprised to learn that Sweeney's mother was the late Rhoda Hawkins, a former</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Codorus Street resident and baker known for her pies and hot rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She owned that store that was right here, the restaurant?&quot; Kirkland said. &quot;OK. I didn't know. See, I'm learning already.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where was your dad born at?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange took place Saturday at the second annual Codorus Street Reunion, an event that celebrated more than 90 years of black history in York and looked to the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkland said black people, including his grandparents, who left the south and came to York were pioneers, looking for a better way of life for their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkland said he previously worked as an information technology project manager for the state and is now semi-retired. He works</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">part-time as a youth counselor. He said he's hoping stories from the struggles of the people who moved to York will help the next generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the people gathered at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park Saturday reflected on old times in the neighborhood and changes in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody was one big happy family,&quot; said Rosetta M. Hawkins, 67, who grew up on Codorus Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She thinks drugs and violence have made the city more dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she hasn't left. She lives several blocks away from where she grew up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all I know,&quot; she said with a laugh. &quot;It's where I've lived all my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric's 64-year-old brother, Jeff, lives on the 400 block of West Market Street, an area known as Doctor's Row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Kirkland said that was an area he wasn't allowed to go to when he was younger because of segregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Kirkland said people often pay attention to racial issues after a tragedy or major incident, such as the fatal shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin last year and the recent acquittal of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A week or two later, people are back into the doldrums,&quot; he said. &quot;They're back into the apathy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was disappointed with the number of eligible black voters who turned out to vote in the May primary. He called it a historic moment, where the city's first elected black female mayor was challenged by the first black female York City Council member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkland said he thinks one way to make progress is to connect young black people with some of the people who grew up on Codorus Street decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are dying off. So we see an extra urgency ... to have our young people interact with some of our older people,&quot; he said. &quot;...They might absorb some of those values, and some of those traditions, some of the culture that we have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Kirkland asked Sweeney and two of her children questions about their family for more than five minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he told them he didn't want to tire them out. He said he'd follow up with them later, and he was thinking about doing video interviews with older people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because ... once that history's gone, man, you just can't get it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They chatted for a few minutes about World War I, speaking French and how people used to hunt groundhogs and other animals along a creek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Kirkland stood up, and started moving to the next family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Sweeney spoke up.&quot;My dad helped dig the foundation to build a church over there, too,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was referring to Emmanuel Church of God in Christ, which was originally built on Codorus Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Kirkland sat back down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Sweeney's children told him that she is an original member of the church, which is now on the 800 block of East Princess Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Kirkland started writing that down.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Lewin has a dilemma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he thought I might find it interesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was right -- I do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gist of it is this: Lewin is the owner of The York Emporium, a used-book/publication shop located at 343 W. Market St., in York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a book peddler. Old books. Used books. And publications of all types. If you enjoy books, but you've never been in his shop, you should go. It reeks of nostalgia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basically, if it's printed on paper, he tries to find a home for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part and parcel of owning a book store, naturally, is being very protective of the printed word. Lewin is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My overall philosophy, simply stated,&quot; Lewin said, &quot;runs along the lines of folks having the right to read whatever they want to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he abhors censorship. &quot;I bristle at the thought of censorship,&quot; he said. Straight to the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said that, though, Lewin is quick to point out he has &quot;resisted suggestions to add a 'blue' section to The York Emporium.&quot; That's &quot;blue,&quot; as in risque, bawdy, vulgar, coarse, dirty, sexual, perhaps even offensive. Go ahead, pick one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, he doesn't want his book store to be viewed as a porn shop. He wants to be taken seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he tries to set a reasonable limit on the material he handles. Something he can live with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it &quot;self-censorship,&quot; I guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, in itself, is not without a certain amount of conflict. But he deals with it the best he can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I stock all sorts of things,&quot; Lewin said. &quot;Ideas are sometimes best when they are dangerous.&quot; Thomas Paine's &quot;Common Sense,&quot; written in 1776, comes quickly to my mind as an example of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is probably fair to say there has never been a time in this country when someone didn't object for one reason or another -- religion, sex, violence, politics, vulgarity -- to the publication of certain printed material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; for instance, was banned for a time. Same for &quot;Tropic of Cancer,&quot; &quot;Slaughterhouse Five,&quot; &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; &quot;The Call of the Wild,&quot; &quot;Lolita,&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.&quot; Even &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; and &quot;The Jungle&quot; were censored/banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of banned/censored books is very long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the sort of thing Lewin would take exception to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So put yourself in his shoes last Wednesday, when a couple walked into his shop carrying several boxes. &quot;It seems they were helping friends clean out the house of their recently deceased parents. The boxes contained the usual sort of materials -- &quot;Little Golden Books from the &nbsp;&nbsp;'60s, a few novels that were popular in the &nbsp;&nbsp;'50s and &nbsp;&nbsp;'60s, one or two Zane Grey novels that dated a little earlier,&quot; Lewin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And two fliers from the Ku Klux Klan that went back 40 or 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the pieces was promoting a rally to have been held in Maryland in 1970,&quot; Lewin said. &quot;The other was a recruiting brochure, along with a post office box in Bucks County.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there you have it. Lewin is in the business of selling old printed material. What would you expect him to do with these KKK publications? What would you do with them if you were in his shoes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This isn't the first time I've had KKK materials,&quot; Lewin said. &quot;For example, there was a trilogy of books, written by Thomas Dixon Jr., at the turn of the last century -- 'The Leopard's Spots,' 'The Clansman,' and 'The Traitor,' were subtitled 'A Romance of the White Man's Burden,' and they all dealt with ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, you know what they dealt with -- the Ku Klux Klan and its ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But,&quot; Lewin said, &quot;these were historical curiosities and revealing of the sensibilities of the times. And those times, of course, were more than a century ago. There is a little safety in distance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, of course, is Lewin doesn't have the luxury of distance in time or space with the two KKK pieces that just came into his shop. I vividly recall covering, as a reporter early in my career, KKK rallies right here in York County. A half-dozen times, at least, in the &nbsp;&nbsp;'70s and &nbsp;&nbsp;'80s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recall covering a KKK cross-burning in Cly in the late-&nbsp;&nbsp;'70s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those activities were then and still are protected by the U.S. Constitution as freedom of speech and the right of people to peaceably assemble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't pretty. Still isn't. But it was part of our history. And if we're smart, we'll have learned something important from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Lewin has concerns because &quot;they scream intolerance. Both extol hatred, or (more kindly) a profound fear of change.&quot; And it comes at a time when the &quot;Trayvon Martin case and debates about immigration&quot; are on the front pages of our newspapers almost every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, however, they are pieces of history -- York County history, even -- and &quot;part of what makes us who were are. As such,&quot; Lewin suggested, &quot;they deserve more respect than a shredder would provide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Lewin finds himself sitting uncomfortably between a rock and a hard place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are a dilemma,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put yourself in his shoes for a moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would you do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Me? Because I believe in preserving history -- good and bad -- I'd sell them to the highest bidder for 10 cents, $10 or $10,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could hold on to them, but that only means the burden of what to do with them would fall to my children after I'm gone. Then my dilemma turns into their dilemma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line, however, is I would not destroy the KKK publications if I owned them, anymore than I would destroy the pistol that was used in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln if I owned it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's just me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What say you?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India, July 28 -- Jay Z admitted that racism still exists in America while defending Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's right to 'stand his ground' with violent retaliation against unprofessional profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hip-hop icon endorsed Martin's battery of George Zimmerman as legitimate self-defense against racial profiling and surveillance by the neighborhood watch volunteer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entertainment mogul told Rap Radar that Zimmerman may have won, but that doesn't mean Trayvon was a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also ridiculed and rejected the right to use a firearm to defend against a home invasion/robbery, the Washington Times reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angry over the acquittal of Zimmerman on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of the 17-year-old Trayvon, the rapper said that Zimmerman's surveillance of Trayvon was a form of predatory pursuit, which licensed a violent counterattack by the targeted teen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Response to &quot;APS funds often don't reach the classroom,&quot; News, July 21</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public school system has an entitlement culture where ex-teachers are channeled into their district office as administrators --- irrespective of the district's need, or the individual's capability. Unfortunately, the APS administration's absorption of funds, although unacceptably high, is not unique in this country. The U.S. spends considerably more on education than any other developed country, but we are consistently behind in student performance. One of the primary reasons is the disproportionate amount spent on school district administration, to the detriment of class performance. We should continue to demand spending and staffing accountability from all school administrations. IAN SHAW, CUMMING</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">real dialogue on race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Toward a more perfect union&quot; (Opinion, July 21), I agree this is a time for dialogue on race in our country. Those of us classified as white must admit that race still has tremendous power in this country. Unless we begin there, any dialogue that follows will be hollow and self-serving. I grew up in the segregated South of the 1950s. I understand that well-meaning white people can be captured by the power of race, and not recognize its deadly power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;What did we learn from this tragedy?&quot; (Opinion, July 21), the author is wrong to dismiss comparisons with the Emmett Till case. That case called to many of us to ask, &quot;Is this our son?&quot; While the jury said &quot;no,&quot; public opinion began to change. The same question can be raised with Trayvon Martin. That verdict answered that he was not our son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for all of us --- especially those who are white --- to begin to say, &quot;Yes, he is our son.&quot; If we can do that, we will have taken a giant step.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Use of temps surging&quot; (Business, July 21) details the tremendous increase in temporary staffing over the past four years. The article says this may be due to the strengthening economy and the flexibility afforded to businesses and workers. While these may or may not be factors in the increase in the temp workforce, the article ignores the &quot;elephant in the room&quot;: the effect of &quot;Obamacare&quot; on business. It is no coincidence that the 53-percent increase in temp staffing has occurred since the passage of the current administration's health care law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the real and expected increases in health insurance costs, and what are seen as onerous additional health insurance costs to employers, it was irresponsible of the writer to remain silent on the effect of Obamacare. Obamacare places many of its costly mandates on employers with 50 or more full-time employees. Many employers already have eliminated --- or have announced intentions to eliminate --- full-time jobs in favor of temporary workers to fall under the 50-employee rule.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole point of concealed carry is to prevent someone from knowing who is armed. Criminals avoid some victims on the chance they are armed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big news in the Au-gusta area last week. Bass Pro Shops is coming to Columbia County; Cabela's is coming to Richmond County. That's great for everybody - hunters, fishermen, campers and the tax men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two interesting stories, albeit insignificant in the grand scheme of things, concerned the frog that got into the rain gauge at Augusta Regional Airport and the Aiken County man with a foot fetish who said during a TV interview: &quot;I want to stop, but not completely stop, because that's what I like. I mean, that's all I have is feet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE MORE FORCE USED TO BREAK UP GANGS, THE EASIER THE TASK WILL BE: Other big news in Augusta was police saying suspects in three recent shootings, one of which resulted in the death of a 19-year-old, were gang members. Sheriff Richard Roundtree is forming a gang task force. Mayor Deke Copenhaver and Augusta Commission members say they support the sheriff, and some have ideas for doing more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Bill Fennoy thinks it would help if the city could spend more on recreation and parks to engage young people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why youths are attracted to gangs, but we need to find out what it is and try to fill that void,&quot; he said. &quot;I know all commissioners are involved and try to be role models, not only for the youth but all residents in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sheriff has a task force, and I'm willing to do whatever I can do to support the sheriff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the last commission meeting, Fennoy placed a large box of Skittles on the dais to show support for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And I honestly believe Trayvon did not do anything wrong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REALISTICALLY SPEAKING: Com-missioner Donnie Smith, who has a 28-year law enforcement background, said government can't solve societal problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Parents have to know where their kids are, what they're doing and who they're hanging out with,&quot; he said. &quot;Law enforcement can only do so much. When they break the law, arrest them and put them in jail. Law enforcement can't raise the children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BILLETS AND BILLBOARDS: Com-mis-sioner Corey Johnson said, &quot;We need to set an example ourselves, but we need to make an example out of those who continuously create these gangs to show that this type of behavior is very aggressive and serious and people are dying as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need to make them go into the military. If they want to be part of a group, they should force them into the military to show them what a real organization is all about and show them how to make a positive difference, not only for themselves but the country. An organization that has a true meaning. A gang with a purpose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as actions commissioners could take, Johnson said that was &quot;tough&quot; because of tasks they already have before them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if we can post signs and billboards and show how critical and devastating it can be if you decide to make that choice, it might help,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to put in preventative measures to make them think about it when they're young. There's not much you can do about it when they're already into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DISCIPLINE DOWN AND PANTS ON THE GROUND: The problem is the parents, Commissioner Marion Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Babies are raising babies,&quot; he said. &quot;When a baby has a baby, and she wasn't trained herself, she can't train that baby. The gang problem is going to get worse until we as adults take responsibility to help this community. We're letting children make these decisions. These children with pants hanging down. They say it's the style. It's not the style. It's a disgrace. The sheriff's got an uphill battle the way children are raising children with no discipline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERYBODY SHOULD PITCH IN: There needs to be a col-lect-ive effort among the com-munity, religious or-ganizations and parents, Com-missioner Bill Lockett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think without that, we're going to continue down this road,&quot; he said. &quot;I think as elected officials we should, as often as possible, go out into the community and converse with young people. These kids are not dumb. They're smart, and we need to channel that. I think we as adults can win this battle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOT IN OUR JOB DESCRIP-TION: Commissioner Grady Smith said, &quot;I think stuff like that should be left to the professional, namely the sheriff and the legal system here in the county. If a lot of these boys would spend their time studying and trying to get a job, they'd be better off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: The mayor stated in an e-mail that he's in contact with Roundtree regularly and that they've developed a very strong working relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am fully supportive of providing the sheriff with whatever means necessary to reduce gang activity in our community, and I fully support law enforcement in their efforts to proactively deal with the situation,&quot; Copenhaver wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHAT I LEARNED ON MY SUMMER TRIP: Fennoy, one of five commissioners to attend the National Association of Counties' annual conference in Fort Worth, Texas, last weekend, said he learned about a couple of projects other counties have initiated, and he plans to follow up on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the moderators operates a veterans court,&quot; he said. &quot;Since we have Fort Gordon and two veterans hospitals, and a large portion of the homeless population are veterans, I'm going to try to get a program started here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson and Williams said they saw firsthand in Fort Worth that an ordinary crosswalk works just fine for pedestrians crossing the street from a hotel and convention center. Johnson said he took photos to prove to the rest of the board that the city doesn't need to build a million-dollar elevated crosswalk over Reynolds Street from the Augusta Convention Center to a parking deck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CREATING T-SPLOST ENVY: Gov. Nathan Deal, De-partment of Transpor-tation board member Don Grantham, local elected officials and others gathered in Augusta two weeks ago to talk about the present and future of the area's transportation sales tax program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deal said the area had set an example for the rest of the state, and that those who didn't buy into the program will regret it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are our example, and we want you to succeed, because if you succeed it does show the merit of local citizens and local communities to buy into the idea of helping themselves, and being a part of a bigger plan,&quot; Deal said. &quot;So I have instructed all my folks and agencies to make sure they do everything they can to make sure you are successful. And I think you will find we are going to be very cooperative in what you want to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He means it, too, because he repeated it later on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want you to succeed because if you don't succeed our message is diluted significantly,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly what is that message, governor?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama is vowing to spend his remaining time in office encouraging bipartisan efforts to strengthen the US middle class by ensuring it is open to those from all backgrounds. &quot;Thanks to the grit and resilience of the American people, we've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and begun to lay a new foundation for a stronger, more durable economic growth,&quot; the president said in a major address on Wednesday. &quot;We are not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life's winners and losers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a new analysis is suggesting that a half-century after the apex of the US civil-rights movement, relatively little progress has been made in education, poverty and wages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The outlook of young people today would be so much different if they knew that when they finished high school or college, they could get a job,&quot; Algernon Austin, director of the Race, Ethnicity and the Economy Programme at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a Washington think tank, said at a symposium last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For young people of color in particular, when they face such high levels of unemployment, it increases their changes of getting tangled in the criminal justice system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a new EPI study, from the 1960s until today, African-American unemployment has been two to 2.5 times the white unemployment rate. In 2012 the black unemployment rate was 14 percent, 2.1 times what it was for whites and higher than the average national unemployment rate of 13.1 percent during the recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to go from protest to action to outcome,&quot; Ernest Green, a former assistant secretary of labor, told Inter Press Service (IPS). &quot;What the [EPI] is doing is important-it's obvious that in this atmosphere, no one person or organization can carry the full load.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when the national unemployment rate has been low, the rate for African-Americans has remained high, according to the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2000, for instance, when the national unemployment rate was at 4 percent and the white unemployment rate was 3.1 percent, the unemployment rate for non-Hispanic blacks was 7.6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study's release was timed to coincide with the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a touchstone 1963 event that brought hundreds of thousands of demonstrators to Washington to urge equal civil and economic rights for African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the event, the civil-rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., gave his famed &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. &quot;We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, as we should be, and yet we have a racial wealth gap that's growing,&quot; Clarence Lang, a professor of African and African American studies at the University of Kansas, said at Monday's symposium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also have an unemployment rate that is catastrophic-if it characterized the majority of the country, we would declare a national disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial profiling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the EPI researchers,        the lowest black poverty rate on record was 22.5 percent in 2000, meaning that nearly a quarter of the African- American population was still living at or below the poverty line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the economic downturn began in December 2007, that rate rose to 27.6 percent, while the white poverty rate was only 9.8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, federal policies aren't doing enough to stem these figures, the report suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to lift a family out of poverty, a full-time worker would have to be paid a minimum wage of $13 an hour, experts have said. Yet the current minimum wage, after adjusting for inflation, is $7.25 per hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education has long been highlighted as one of the top ways to combat the high black unemployment and poverty rates, although the EPI study outlines several problems with this approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 1960s, for instance, more than three-quarters of black children attended majority-black schools, while today almost the exact same proportion attends majority non-white schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Segregated schools have long been found to lack equal resources as schools with majority white students, which the EPI suggests violates the US belief in equal opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to William Spriggs, the chief economist at American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, one of the country's largest labor unions, education is only one of the solutions to this problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the recent US court case in which a neighborhood watch member shot and killed a black teenager in Florida and was acquitted, arguably largely due to a law allowing the use of deadly force if one feels threatened, as an example of the race culture that still exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What people need to understand about the [Trayvon] Martin case is what that jury was saying about young black men,&quot; Spriggs said. &quot;Do you really have to ask why young black men are having a hard time getting jobs? In the African-American community, yes, education is important, but there is a lot more going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Lang, one of the key problems being little discussed in the public debate today is the general notion that a black youth walking around at night is &quot;up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want to talk about what the key issue is, we have to talk about [racial profiling],&quot; Lang told IPS. &quot;It affects job prospects, it affects families and, indeed, it affects someone's ability to walk around minding his or her own business and not being harassed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such profiling, critics say, re-introduces a divisiveness that many saw as being weakened during the March on Washington and related awareness-raising of the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are at a moment when there are no allies, there is just 'us,'&quot; Keith Ellison, a member of the US Congress, said on Monday. &quot;In the civil-rights movement, some blacks would refer to whites as allies, but in this fight for America's soul and dignity and economic fairness, there are no allies. We are all in this thing.&quot; IPS</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New form can ensure end-of-life wishes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read with interest the opinion piece by Ellen Goodman about Nelson Mandela and her call for end-of-life conversations before they are needed. Many people around the country and in Illinois also agree with her and have been working to help people identify their power of attorney for health care and make their wishes known for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, Illinois released a new form to be used by critically ill people to say what treatments that they do and do not want, should their condition become life-threatening. Some people are adamant that they do not want a feeding tube or artificial resuscitation, while others expect that every effort will be taken to keep them alive as long as possible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Illinois Advance Directive DNR/POLST form is completed with the patient's physician, and provides a way for the patient to understand and communicate what they want in a way that all health providers will understand. POLST (Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment) is a type of directive that is used in many states, and has been shown to ensure that a person's wishes are honored. The POLST form is an important tool people can use to communicate their wishes, and more information is available at http://www.cecc.info.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, nothing takes the place of a clear and honest conversation. Far from being morbid, these conversations can support families in coming together to celebrate the life of their loved one rather than fighting over a feeding tube. As Ms. Goodman states, everyone should have a conversation with their loved ones about their feelings with regard to end-of-life care, and how they would like to be remembered. Isn't that the legacy that everyone would want to have?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a very long time now, the estimate of 11 million illegal immigrants having crossed our border has been the accepted number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our border was not and is not closed, and there is no evidence that the illegals have stopped coming. So, isn't it time that the number be updated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, I feel estimating the number is ridiculous because how does one count the number of illegals not seen crossing?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coverage of trial was lopsided</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've seldom seen such a lopsided coverage of a story by the news media as has taken place regarding the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin case. Martin was consistently portrayed as an innocent youngster by repeatedly publishing a photo taken when he was 14 years old while in fact he was actually now larger than Zimmerman. Meanwhile Zimmerman was consistently portrayed as a racist vigilante who was looking for trouble. Zimmerman was actually an authorized volunteer night watchman responding to the crime problem in his gated community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another oft-repeated criticism was his failure to obey the request of the police dispatcher &quot;to stop following the suspect.&quot; Zimmerman was doing his job of seeing what Martin was up to and was under no obligation to obey the police dispatcher. According to the evidence presented at the trial, Martin objected to being followed, turned around and attacked Zimmerman, knocked him down and was slamming his head against the sidewalk when Zimmerman shot him. I guess if Zimmerman had only just let Martin bash his brains out, all this controversy could have been avoided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen-year-old Myanna Rodgers held a sign saying &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; on Saturday and chanted along with other protesters in Elgin who demanded the repeal of stand-your-ground self-defense laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanna, who pumped her fist in the air every time a car honked in approval, was among about 30 people who gathered at the protest organized by the group Occupy Elgin at the corner of Grove Avenue and Kimball Street, across from Gail Borden Public Library in Elgin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myanna said she and her three cousins, ages 8 to 12, wore hoodies to symbolize their support for Florida teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who wore a hoodie when he was shot and killed in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The message is, 'Stop racial profiling,' and 'Don't judge someone by the way they dress,'&quot; Myanna said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder and manslaughter charges earlier this month in Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida adopted its stand-your-ground law in 2005; among other things, the law eliminated the duty to retreat before using deadly force. Illinois doesn't have such a law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of us felt sick at the verdict. We felt it was just so unjust,&quot; Occupy Elgin organizer Mary Shesgreen said. &quot;There is a double standard of justice. Poor people, and especially people of color, are more likely to be stopped, more likely to be arrested, more likely to be charged, more likely to be prosecuted -- and more likely to get poor legal defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest was justice for everyone, regardless of race, resident Bennie Sowers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not asking for special favors. We're just asking to be treated equal,&quot; she said. &quot;To fight this, we need to come together as one. We are all in this together, so we better learn how to get along.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone agreed with the demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algonquin resident Jeff Gibbs and his son Jonathan were on their way back from a bike ride to St. Charles when they passed by the protesters. Both said the Zimmerman jury made the right decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The facts supported that he could have used deadly force if he was beaten within an inch of his life,&quot; Jeff Gibbs said. &quot;I'm not for repealing stand-your-ground laws. It's our constitutional right to defend ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest wasn't just about the Zimmerman case, but about the injustices perpetrated by the justice system, beginning with racial profiling, Elgin attorney Traci Ellis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not troubled as much by the letter of the law as I am by the application of the law,&quot; Ellis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are entering an era I call 'Jim Crow Jr.,'&quot; she added, pointing to the things such as a recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court striking down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the solution, Ellis said she believes it begins with talking candidly about racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to be bold enough to talk about it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Baloch have been going missing since the early 1970s but the dirty war against them has intensified since 2005 and not a single perpetrator has even been named; On February 26, 2012, 17-year-old African-American Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was shot dead by George Zimmerman claiming self-defence; there were no witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 13, 2013 the six-woman jury with three choices - guilty of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and not guilty - after deliberating for 16 hours found him not guilty. The only African-American woman on the jury later said that Zimmerman got away with murder. There have been mild protests, while on April 29, 1992 when the accused in Rodney King's beating case were acquitted, Los Angeles riots followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And by the time order was restored the riots had caused 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly one billion dollars in financial losses. Some things may have changed in the US but the justice system is still not colour blind; at the time of announcing the judgment, the blindfold on the eyes of the lady of justice slips just a little to ensure that it sees that the victim is black and the perpetrator white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brutal murder of Emmett Louis Till from Chicago, Illinois, the 14-year-old African-American boy who was murdered in Mississippi on August 28, 1955, after reportedly flirting with a white woman, though not widely known, is noted as a pivotal event motivating the African-American Civil Rights Movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visiting his relatives in Money, Mississippi, he reportedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant, a small grocery store owner. Several nights later, her husband Roy Bryant and his half-brother John William Milam took him from his great-uncle's house, beat him, gouged out one of his eyes, shot him in the head and then weighting his body with a 32 kg cotton gin fan, threw it in the Tallahatchie River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discovered and retrieved three days later with face mutilated beyond recognition, he was positively identified by the ring that his mother had given him, engraved with his father's initials LT (Louis Till).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Till's body was returned to his mother Mamie Till in Chicago; she who had raised him mostly by herself, insisted on a public funeral service with an open casket because as she put it, &quot;Let the world see what has happened, because there is no way I could describe this. And I needed somebody to help me tell what it was like.&quot; Tens of thousands attended his funeral or viewed his casket; images of his mutilated body were published in black magazines like Jet and newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because then blacks and women were barred from serving jury duty, Bryant and Milam were tried before an all-white, all-male jury. In an act of extraordinary bravery, Moses Wright, Till's uncle, risking retribution, took the stand and identified them as Till's kidnappers and killers, yet both were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months later, protected by double jeopardy laws they, for $ 4,000, told Emmett Till's kidnap and murder story to Look magazine. Black support and white sympathy in the northern US brought to bear on the condition of black civil rights in Mississippi as newspapers there criticised the crime but soon the whites in the South rallied support for the killers; Southern newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, wrote that the court system had done its job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This warped dispensation of justice shows how the establishment's narrative, because of its instruments of force and unchallenged influence, becomes the dominant narrative and decides how justice is meted out to those whom the state and influential elements target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tainted justice is the norm wherever the state, through illegal methods, seeks to undermine the rights of people and the judiciary feels obligated to cover the backs of erring institutions and individuals violating human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this unfairly dispensed tainted justice that nurtures the culture of impunity and this is exactly what has been happening in Pakistan since 1947. Hundreds of Baloch Emmett Tills have been murdered for angering the state with demands for their rights while the Pakistani Bryants, Milams and Zimmermans have enjoyed complete immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 23, 2013, Potohar Town Superintendent Police Haroon Joya informed the three-member Supreme Court (SC) bench headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, hearing the missing persons cases that following the court's orders he got the arrest warrants of ISI Brigadier Mansoor Saeed Sheikh from Rawalpindi Civil Judge Irfan Naseem Tarar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief Justice asked him to 'exercise caution' in this matter and observed that institutions should not be blamed for the acts of individuals. Needless to remind that the SC claims that it would not rest unless the missing persons were recovered and those responsible punished proved hollow, as it chose to support the erring institution over and above the demands of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently when the so-called honour of institutions is at stake the rights of people become meaningless. As long as 'exercising caution' remains the keystone and watchword of justice where erring institutions' violations of human rights are concerned, the Baloch and Sindhis will continue to be meted out the justice that was Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and Emmett Louis Till's fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The establishment always 'exercises caution' in its dealings with the Haqqani group, the Quetta Shura, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, the Musala Diffa Tanzeem and outfits it uses as strategic assets for acquiring strategic depth in Afghanistan, against the nationalists or for keeping India on its toes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The establishment rides roughshod over the Baloch in an attempt to subdue them to exploit their resources. Apparently since Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM) came up with its July 6 Sindh's independence demand, the 'dirty war' against Sindhi nationalists has intensified; two workers of JSMM, brothers Ali and Zafar Noonari, have gone missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Baloch have been going missing since the early 1970s but the dirty war against them has intensified since 2005 and not a single perpetrator has even been named. The systematic dirty war being conducted by the army, the Frontier Corps and intelligence agencies has perturbed neither the judiciary nor the public at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never has any institution here asked the perpetrators to 'exercise caution' or ventured to question their atrocities. Probably when there is so much at stake for the establishment and rulers in the form of economic gain from resources, people become expendable, the Baloch being deemed expendable in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that the judiciary and the media have done so far is to plod along proving that the need of maintaining the status quo far outweighs their need for questioning atrocities, first against Bengalis and now the Baloch. A commission on missing persons exists and a task force too is in the offing but then Pakistan is the notorious Bermuda Triangle for the same.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace Colbert looks a lot like two of my granddaughters. Same tan skin. Same curly black hair. Same killer smile. But, unlike my granddaughters, whose performances have been limited to local youth theater productions, 6-year-old Grace is a professional television actress. Perhaps you've seen her perform. She stars in a cereal commercial in which her &quot;mother&quot; tells her the cereal is &quot;heart healthy.&quot; So Grace runs into the living room where her &quot;father&quot; is napping and pours some of it on his chest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commercial has been airing since May and the overwhelming majority of viewers liked it on Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, though, found reason to be outraged - because the &quot;mother&quot; is white and the &quot;father&quot; is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those people made their feelings about interracial marriage felt on social media, many of them citing their interpretations of Bible scriptures and using phrases I have no intention of dignifying here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the age of 6, Grace is too young to understand what has been called &quot;a tempest in a cereal bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her real-life biracial parents, &quot;she thinks all the attention is because she has a great smile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the cereal company eventually found it necessary to disable the comments section on YouTube concerning the commercial, it has stood by it, declaring &quot;... we know there are all kinds of families and we celebrate them all.&quot; There are, in fact, an estimated 2.5 million biracial families in this country, including mine. As Grace's father put it, &quot;We're also part of the face of America.&quot; And last week, a new video appeared online. In this one, a dozen children aged 7-13 sat in front of a camera and gave their opinions for a feature called &quot;Kids react ... &quot; What did they think of the commercial, an interviewer asked. &quot;Cute ... funny,&quot; they agreed. What did they think of the family? &quot;Looked like a normal family,&quot; was the consensus. Did you notice anything different about the family? None of them did. Did you know that some people were offended by the commercial? &quot;Why?&quot; they wondered, clearly puzzled. Because the parents were biracial, the interviewer explained. The kids' reactions were expressed in typical kids-speak. &quot;That's messed up.&quot; &quot;That's so stupid.&quot; &quot;That's just sad.&quot; &quot;I thought Martin Luther King fixed that already,&quot; one boy said. MLK didn't, of course; the ongoing controversy in the wake of the Trayvon Martin case emphasizes that. And a video of a dozen kids speaking from their hearts isn't going to fix it, either. But watching it gives me reason to hope that some day my granddaughters might follow in the tiny footsteps of Grace Colbert. And that ALL the attention will be focused on their killer smiles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recognition of his sterling contribution to the development of African literature, Professor Chinua Achebe was honoured posthumously in Lagos recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nostalgic recollections, eulogies, an impromptu poetry delivery, calls to action, a flashback to one heart-rending occurrence, an endless supply of champagne and then finally, a toast to memories, work, and indelible legacy of a man who changed the world with his pen. These were the highlights of the Moet &amp; Chandon-hosted toast event held in honour of the late revered author, humanitarian and literary icon, Chinua Achebe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The luxury champagne house gathered together at the Kongi's Harvest Gallery, Freedom Park, an interesting mix of Nigeria's literati and distinguished personalities in media, entertainment, business and society circles to &quot;toast to an extraordinary life&quot; as the event invitation card read. Most distinguished of them all was none other than recently controversial social commentator par excellence, celebrated writer and Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka. His presence was rather poetic, a comrade-in-literary-arms paying tribute to another. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening started off as a meet-and-greet with guests sharing their different experiences of Achebe's body of work. This opening session confirmed to this reporter that everyone who has read Achebe leaves his work with a story of their own, a life lesson or an impossibly indelible impression. These floated and hummed around the room for a spell, accompanied by the highlife music of yesteryear's maestros such as Victor Uwaifo, Steve Osita Osadebe, playing in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, it was time for the reading session curated by freelance journalist, Tolu Ogunlesi. Respected writers, authors and fellow journalists in persons of, amongst others, Eghosa Imaseun, Jahman Anikulapo, Deji Toye, Lola Shoneyin, Toyin Akinosho, stepped up front and centre in quick succession to read their favourite passages from a number of Achebe's books - the highly critically-acclaimed, world-renowned and the rabble-rousing, once-upon-a-time-headline-dominating, historical/autobiographical curtain call salvo, There Was a Country. Extolling Achebe's mastery of words, the lessons deftly layered within his stories and their consequence for our society at large, the speakers also touched on their personal interactions with Achebe whether via his books or physically. Mr. Jahman Anikulapo's account was especially compelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been detailed to cover Achebe's arrival back into the country in the early 90's. Sometime before, Achebe had been savaged by one of Nigeria's many reliably decrepit roads in an accident that paralysed him from the waist down. He had left the country for further medical care after being poorly handled by another incompetent institution - a Nigerian hospital. When abroad, it was then confirmed that his ability to walk could not be salvaged. Years later, he was to return to the country and special arrangements were to be put in place by the Ministry of Culture to welcome him not only because of his standing but also of his state of limited mobility. Anikulapo recalled with disgust that no such arrangement was made. Achebe, revered father of African literature was carried on the back of a woman perhaps an air hostess to the waiting lounge. There was no fanfare, red carpets, not even the humanity of a wheelchair. A jolt of shock blitzed around the gallery. How could a national treasure be treated so? Anikulapo then remarked cynically that the same members of government, who treated Achebe with such disdain were the first ones with empty, patronising words, claiming kinship with him at his graveside. An interesting side-note, Ojo Maduekwe was then the Minister of Culture. He is now Nigeria's High Commissioner to Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anikulapo also charged everyone (everyone being today's generation, presumably) guilty of a reductive regard for Achebe. He declared as regrettable how the media throughout Achebe's life and career berated him perhaps unwittingly, fingering him in apocryphal, long drawn-out stories of bad blood with his contemporaries notably Wole Soyinka, Elechi Amadi and Cyprian Ekwensi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reading session ended on Anikulapo's reproof and then guests present were afforded the floor to tell what Achebe meant and represented to them, the impact his work had on their lives. Yet another compelling story unravelled during this. One guest, flushed with emotion, (she didn't even give her name) revealed that it had been a lifelong dream of hers to meet Achebe in the flesh. However, this was not to be while he was alive. Upon his death however, a chance presented itself to meet him. As fate would have it, she is a journalist and similar to Anikulapo, was detailed to cover his funeral. She went above and beyond following Achebe's body as it was honoured and celebrated on a tour across the country from Abuja, to Nnewi, Nsukka and finally his hometown, Ogidi. On this tour, she connected ephemerally, in a somewhat spectral fashion to this man who had inspired her beyond measure. She finished her tale, mysteriously, with the words, &quot;I am Achebe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other guests had their say. One, an (also) unnamed, dreadlocked man opined that Achebe was a revolutionary. Like his character Okonkwo, he spoke up on the issues that mattered. He never cowered. He never pandered to any affiliation; he fought with his words, voice courageously despite numerous attempts to stifle it. The dreadlocked gentleman even went as far as to draw a parallel between Achebe and the slain black American teenager, Trayvon Martin; a boy who, according to him, stood his ground when challenged though he paid dearly for it with his life. He encouraged all to imbibe this brand of fearlessness in the face of perceived wrong. Concluding, he spoke against the now fashionable trend in today's literary circles wherein supposed luminaries or experts dictate to others how they should write. He drew from one of Achebe's timeless quotes, &quot;If you do not like someone's story, write your own... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another guest, Zack Brisson, revealed that Achebe was the light that showed him the way out of a crisis of identity, in his past. On the cusp of adulthood, not sure of what to do with himself, the book, Things Fall Apart was the brainwave that informed a crucial move on the chessboard of life. He decided to study history at the university, a decision that has contributed positively to making him the man he is today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, time having danced away into the night, the event came to an end but not before a crisp white procession of waiters permeated the gallery serving tall, gleaming glasses of champagne from delicately balanced trays. Drinks in raised hands, the room toasted heartily to the extraordinary life and work of Chinualumogu Albert Achebe.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. No one doubts that. But it was only one tragedy among many thousands that have been essentially ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, speaking out on July 19 on the result of the Zimmerman trial, scolded us all for essentially stereotyping and profiling black men in our society. He said that he himself had been a victim of such profiling when he was younger. He told us that most African American males, himself included, have had the experience of hearing locks clicking on the doors of cars as they walk down the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's right: Young black men are &quot;profiled&quot; every day by nearly everyone, black and white. President Obama should ask himself why that is true. The answer is there, but you really have to look for it. With rare exception, politicians and the media ignore it. It's the elephant in the room that everyone wants to pretend isn't there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Nutter, the thoughtful and courageous black mayor of Philadelphia, is the exception. He sees the elephant very clearly. He says that in his city, 75 percent of the homicide victims are black men. About 80 percent of those arrested and convicted of those murders are also black men. A 2007 U.S. Justice Department study verifies the mayor's observation for urban areas throughout the nation. (You can find it at www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/bvvc.pdf.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Americans are the victims of roughly 8,000 homicides a year. At least 80 percent of those are committed by young black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bit of perspective is in order. We've fought wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for 10 years. As of February 2012, a total of 6,365 Americans have died in both conflicts combined. Young black men kill more of their fellow young black men in our country, each and every year, than the total number of Americans who have died in both wars over the last 10 years. During that period of time, nearly 80,000 African Americans have been murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the outrage? Has the media raised a fuss over these 80,000 tragic deaths? Has Attorney General Eric Holder threatened federal investigations or criminal civil rights indictments because of any of them? Have there been mass demonstrations to mourn the loss of any of them? The answer is &quot;no&quot; the media, the president, the politicians and civil rights leaders with the exception of Nutter and a few others have managed to largely ignore this monumental American tragedy. No one asks on behalf of the 80,000 victims: &quot;Why did this happen? Why does it continue to happen? Who is responsible? What can we do to stop this epidemic of needless deaths?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Nutter asked recently, &quot;Why is it that African American males are so disproportionately both the victims and perpetrators of violence, more often than not against each other?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this big city mayor the only man in America with the courage to confront these issues head on? On one occasion, Nutter blasted the city's absentee fathers who, he implied, were at least partly responsible for the crimes that their children committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have made vast progress in race relations in America in the last 50 years, stunning progress that I have been privileged to witness. But until we have the courage to acknowledge the ongoing tragedy of black on black crime in America have a genuine, honest and far reaching conversation about it, and apply our very best efforts to remedy it future progress is doubtful indeed. If there is a more important or pressing problem for the leaders of our nation to tend to, you would be hard pressed to name it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nutter says, &quot;We can change things, that I know. The question is, are we ready to do it? Are we willing to set ego aside, be vulnerable and hear things that none of us necessarily want to hear? We have to try right now, because our children are dying in the streets every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the Zimmerman case, while hard for some to accept, was understandable. Standing by silently while 8,000 African Americans are murdered each year is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When will our leaders, black and white, state, local and federal, join hands with Nutter to look for solutions to this pressing crisis?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has launched yet another racist diatribe against an innocent white community which, largely, couldn't care less about a person's color. This is not 1960. More than 50 years of great progress, greater than anywhere on the planet, is tossed aside in an attempt to continue the victimhood of the black community. King, Cosby, and so many others are nothing but the wind when they call on blacks to take personal responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not lock my car when a black man passes. I don't care about skin color. The tragedy is that this president and his political operatives continue to stoke the fires of mistrust, continue to preach victimhood, and continue to make the color of a person's skin at birth the most important event of their lives. How demeaning! How condescending! How unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's thoughtful speech on race in this country sounded exactly the right note to frame this discussion. He challenged each of us to raise our unconscious biases to consciousness in order to confront them and defeat them. Race and racism are difficult topics, but ignoring them does not advance understanding. I challenge those who immediately criticized the speech to listen to his words without their Obama hatred screens in place. I am proud of my president's leadership.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am so disappointed (again) in our president taking such a racially combative stance in the Zimmerman/Martin case. He should be standing up for our Constitution and justice system by supporting the decision of a jury. The jury has spoken and said that they were not convinced of clear cut wrongdoing in the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me see if I have this right. The attorneys in the Zimmerman trial did not once bring up the subject of race as a factor in the self defense shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because all the facts and witnesses said otherwise. But what does President Obama do? Yep, you got it. He holds a White House press conference and brings race into the issue. Way to go, Mr. President why not throw gas on the fire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Canino, Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have to take exception to those who are criticizing President Obama's speech as opening and/or exacerbating divisions in our society best left alone. Rather, I see his speech as sharing a very personal perspective that many of us who are not African American males could not have related to before he shared his perspective. This is the sort of leadership we should appreciate and expect from our first African American president. Yes, it is uncomfortable, but these are the sorts of discussions we need as a nation to get us to the next level in terms of ridding ourselves of racism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Scarcity of GOP candidates,&quot; July 21 letter to the editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Letter writer Zach Frederick comforts himself by rationalizing the GOP's current lack of credible candidates is due to them preferring private jobs over governing in a two party system. More likely, it's because potential GOP candidates are discouraged in the knowledge that their own party today wouldn't support what many in today's topsy turvy GOP might call &quot;tax raising, soft on immigration RINOs&quot; like Ronald Reagan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Time for immigration reform is now,&quot; July 21 guest commentary by U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an evangelical leader from Denver Seminary and a constituent of Colorado's 6th Congressional District, I was pleased to read Rep. Mike Coffman's guest commentary in last Sunday's Denver Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was pleased for two reasons. First, the Bible is very clear about the matchless value of every human being and God's concern for immigrants. Second, I work with undocumented immigrants and attend a Hispanic church in Aurora. For me, immigration reform is personal. It is about friends and fellow Christians real people and families, with faces and names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need immigration reform that respects the God given dignity of all persons, as well as changes that constructively engage security and economic issues. Rep. Coffman's courageous call to work on our badly broken immigration system is imperative and one that needs bipartisan support. I hope our other representatives are willing to come together to support this pressing initiative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here we go again &quot;Midterm Mike Coffman&quot; comes across as thoughtful, compassionate and reasonable. Although if you read the last few paragraphs of his immigration article carefully, he uses the obstructionist language of border security and enforcement, &quot;treated like any applicant&quot; and a much higher standard for English proficiency and understanding of civic culture. He points a finger at employers but will be silent in Washington as industry diverts attention away from their role, reliance and profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If 6th Congressional District Coloradans want to elect someone who really supports immigration reform, Andrew Romanoff will bring that honest and compassionate commitment that so many of us are waiting for from Congress, especially the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's not be fooled again by Coffman, a staunch obstructionist Republican.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Tempers run high, unlike water,&quot; July 21 news story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When our state's drought is so severe that neighbors are fighting neighbors over water, why is the oil and gas industry allowed to continue using the extraction method known as fracking? It has been reported that one fracked well requires a much as 5 million gallons of water. A well may be fracked multiple times. Unlike in agriculture or household use, most of that water never returns to the water cycle. It is permanently consumed. Can we afford to allow our most precious resource to be plundered in this way?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protecting Denver's parks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;Missing the mark on Denver's parks,&quot; July 21 Susan Barnes Gelt column; and &quot;Holding open space is a battle,&quot; July 21 Tom Noel column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kudos to Susan Barnes Gelt and Tom Noel for their columns in last Sunday's Denver Post regarding the critical importance of protecting existing parks and open space. Having parks and natural areas close to home where all of us but especially those with limited transportation, such as children and the elderly can connect with nature is vital to our quality of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, it seems that some government entities, including those responsible for protection of our parks and open space, do not share this perspective. Shameful examples are the case of Denver trading away part of Hentzell Park and the proposed Chatfield reallocation project, which would effectively remove 587 acres (approximately 15 percent) of park land from the heart of Chatfield State Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a sad situation when citizens have to resort to litigation to protect these irreplaceable public amenities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gene R. Reetz, Denver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for the park columns by Suan Barnes Gelt and Tom Noel. The issue in Denver parks is not the manager so much as the policy. Shoving parks into the city's revenue stream and selling them off is a deep misunderstanding of what the role of parks in our city should be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: &quot;McBudget for the Boss,&quot; July 21 Al Lewis column (Wall Street Journal Sunday section in The Denver Post).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I always enjoy reading Al Lewis' Sunday column, usually about the rich gaming the system and getting richer at others' expense. Now we learn that the CEO of McDonald's makes 550 times the wages of his counter service employees. I am wondering what the CEO is doing to justify a salary of a quarter million dollars a week. Deciding when to relaunch the McRib?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adjusted for inflation, minimum wage is 20 percent less than it was in 1967. It's time to limit CEO compensation to, say, 200 times the wage of the lowest paid employee. McDonald's employees should not be the serfs of Don Thompson's kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Aldridge, Golden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re: July 21 Mike Keefe editorial cartoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Keefe's cartoon asks readers to guess the outcome of the trial if the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin/George Zimmerman roles had been reversed. How fast we forget O.J. Simpson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Mouton, Centennial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Keefe's cartoon misses the mark. It implies that had the shooter been black, there would be a different trial verdict. Had George Zimmerman been black, there is no chance there would have been a trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the summer the city Parks and Recreation Department offers summer swimming leagues. There are two, the public league and the private league. My children have been participating in these programs for at least 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds, if not thousands, of El Paso's children compete each summer. The teams my children have been on practice four days a week, getting up early on Saturday mornings for the meets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The championship meets for the two leagues were held the past two weekends at the Pavo Real park pool. Yet I can only recall two times that in all the years my children have competed that I have seen in the news or read in the El Paso Times any coverage of these events. I am pretty sure these kids would love to see their names and results in the Sports section of the El Paso Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people are interested they can see the results on the city Parks and Rec website in the aquatics section under the summer swim league.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Council on right track</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Great job, City Council, for denying former Mayor Cook reimbursement of legal fees. This is the kind of level-headed, clear thinking the council has lacked for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cook took this upon himself and disregarded the will of the people, so in true form he should own this on his own. There are more wrongs to be corrected. Go Oscar and crew!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Horan East El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raising taxes without questions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it when a taxing entity wants more money, taxes are raised without really any questions asked? How are we as tax payers to honestly believe in these extremely hard economic times that more taxes are really needed or is it a wish list? Are these taxing entities looking inward first for cost savings before looking outward for more revenue? I challenge the City Council to randomly poll &quot;tax-paying&quot; citizens around the city to find out what their constituents really think. Let's try the transparency idea and see where it takes the council. This should be an eye opener for sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Horan East El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So confused about killings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm confused. A mother kills her 2-year-old baby and is charged for murder. A mother chooses to kill her baby in the womb and goes to a clinic to have a doctor kill her baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor has studied many years in the medical field and knows that a baby exists in the womb, and he kills the baby. No charges are filed against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the protesters, women, men and parents, want the women to have the right to kill the baby in the womb. Yet all these protesters are alive because their mother (and father) chose to give birth. They don't understand this? This is the reason they are alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution is so simple. Don't get pregnant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then we have all the politicians who know the law, but vote in favor of women to kill the baby in the womb. Unfortunately this starts from the president, Supreme Court, Congress and some judges and elected officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways we, the citizens of the country, are at fault for voting for the same officials over and over again. God forgive us for our actions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers should discuss Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though not talked about nearly as much as I thought it would locally, our social studies and language arts teachers may want to consider what kind of academic mileage we can get from a discussion about the George Zimmerman murder trial and the third branch of government. Despite what any of us might feel about the outcome of the trial and the verdict reached, the HOT (Higher Order Thinking) question -- How does our judicial branch and the Florida State Attorney's Office prosecute two firearms cases and reach such divergent outcomes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one case, prosecuted by Angela Corey, the Florida state attorney, under the provisions of &quot;stand your ground,&quot; Marissa Alexander fired a warning shot into the wall of her home to frighten away a violent and abusive husband. She is found guilty of &quot;unlawful discharge of a firearm and is later sentenced to 20 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the same prosecutor, and under the provisions of the very same law, George Zimmerman shoots and kills Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, is acquitted and goes free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How could the same state judicial system, with the same prosecutor, and under the provisions of the same law, reach such a different result?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey is one of the common denominators. The second, Alexander and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin are both black and both the victim. For Alexander, that court system confiscates her gun, sends her &quot;to jail&quot; and the other person, Zimmerman, is sent home with his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander put a bullet in the wall and Zimmerman put a boy in his grave and goes free. This is actually a great case study in any circle of academia as well as the NAACP, Border Network for Human Rights, MALDEF, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will our print and broadcast media step forward to facilitate such a dialogue?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent protests over the George Zimmerman trial and verdict speak volumes about how deep racism is in Florida and other parts of the country. Lately, though, we've seen racial hatred extend its tentacles far beyond people of color. Immigrants have become the latest target of bigotry and prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tea Party activists and GOP lawmakers recently gathered in Washington to rail against an immigration reform bill passed by the Senate. The event was linked to a number of political figures, including Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), and organizer John Tanton, who has called African-Americans a &quot;retrograde species.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech that could have been cc'd from Herman Goering, circa 1933, Tea Party co-founder Ken Crow brought xenophobia to a new high when he stated, &quot;From those incredible bloodlines of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and John Smith. And all these great Americans, Martin Luther King. These great Americans who built this country. You came from them. And the unique thing about being from that part of the world, when you learn about breeding, you learn that you cannot breed Secretariat to a donkey and expect to win the Kentucky Derby. You guys have incredible DNA and don't forget it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racism worries me, the stupidity frightens me. This obsessing about breeding is downright creepy. I had no idea the Tea Party had plans to incorporate Hitler's master race into their 2016 platform. Oh, and the reference to Dr. King? That was an obvious red herring, a kind of inoculation that gave Mr. Crow license to prove he was not racist and say whatever he wanted. Either that or he was referring to 16th-century religious reform leader Martin Luther.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Crow must be following in the footsteps of his dad, Jim. Not only was his speech offensive, it was un-American. He mentioned that breeding with immigrants was a no-no, and that American DNA was better. Sadly, the irony and hypocrisy was lost on the Tea Party leader. A little research on his part would have shown that the United States is a nation of immigrants. We are all just mixed-blood mutts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the nasty truth about immigration that Crow and his cronies like to keep under wraps. They believe that no illegal immigrant should be allowed a path to citizenship or amnesty because the wealthy would lose their never-ending supply of cheap labor. They're reluctant to change the immigration system because that would cut into their profits and dilute the country's so-called racial purity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White supremacists think they're better than everyone else when in fact they are the lowest of the low. They claim to be true Americans but are clueless about the history of our country. They have no idea that Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, and immigrants helped win the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, both world wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. They're unaware that these people built our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People like Crow represent the exact opposite of what America is about. The founding fathers wanted people with diverse beliefs and interests to form a government that would provide for the common good of all. The Tea Party (bless their tiny hearts) advocates for an exclusionary society comprised of self-interests without obligations to their fellow citizens, even if the gap between rich and poor becomes wide enough to drive a revolution through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guilt doesn't stop them. Nothing does. The Tea Party is indefatigable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Crow and his ilk, our nation is deeply and thoroughly racist, and many churches and religionists are among the most bigoted and discriminatory of all. We still have a Ku Klux Klan and a white supremacist movement filled with members who consider themselves good Christians. Go figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless we stop seeing ourselves as part of anything but the human race, we will remain a nation of fear and hatred. We are brothers and sisters whether we think differently, look differently, or worship differently. Until we are all of the same heart, spirit and soul, there will be more chaos. The tragic story of Trayvon Martin will play itself out over and over again. If we continue to view life through a racist lens, all we will ever see is racism.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for good people to stand up and get involved. To quote Rev. John Guns, pastor of St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, we need to &quot;build bridges and break barriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns is doing his part by leading a nationwide campaign called &quot;Save Our Sons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His approach is to take positive action within the African-American community in the spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness, not anger. For instance, he will be holding a seminar in September to help fathers be better fathers. But he can't do it alone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can congregations of different races meet to talk respectfully and openly about important issues? Can members have dinner together?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns' church across from Ribault High School was the site of a forum Saturday evening, July 20, to discuss some of the issues surrounding the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns said America is too often &quot;painfully polarized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to change how we see each other,&quot; Guns said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussion, moderated by the Rev. John Newman, senior pastor at the Sanctuary at Mt. Calvary, was filled with thoughtful comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns has received inquiries from dozens of cities interested in setting up their own chapters of Save Our Sons, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few of the issues raised at the discussion:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPEAK TO YOUTH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Jefferson, the former spokesman for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, said he tells his own son that if confronted, try to get away. Then call police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If confronted by police, be respectful, cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. R. L. Gundy said it seems the African-American male is an endangered species. There is a feeling that the criminal justice system doesn't work for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duval Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said he chose to speak to his young children about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing Guns' statement, he said, &quot;We don't know each other. We don't trust each other.&quot; Are we willing to have difficult conversations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People of good will need to leave their comfort zones and talk about issues that sometimes make them uncomfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, there are a number of changes in the public sphere that could be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REFORM STAND YOUR GROUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not have been the intent of the law, but it has helped produce a wave of justifiable homicides as documented by The Tampa Bay Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the governor's task force report, a South Florida prosecutor, Katharine Fernandez Rundle of Miami, proposed several helpful changes in the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The statute has removed all requirements of reasonableness on the part of the person who uses deadly force against someone ...&quot; she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her view, the law may present an &quot;irrebuttable presumption,&quot; meaning authorities cannot even look at evidence to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thus, a person who without permission, enters another's yard to ask directions, or sell something and forcefully opens a porch door, can be killed without questions being asked first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That person, who can be a child, may be conclusively presumed to have been there to do violence, and no evidence to the contrary can legally make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Jacksonville elected officials - Sen. Audrey Gibson and Reps. Reggie Fulwood and Mia Jones - have offered proposed changes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Eliminate the self-defense immunity if the defendant took himself to the fight when he could have stayed in a safe place instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Immunity should not be available to aggressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Provide less confusing instructions to juries, that justifiable use of deadly force is only allowed when a threat is imminent and when a person cannot safely avoid the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Require law enforcement to issue guidelines for neighborhood watch programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Specify that immunity provisions do not restrict law enforcement agencies from investigating use-of-force cases when a person claims immunity/self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these suggestions appear reasonable on their face and deserve consideration by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXAMINE CONCEALED CARRY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legislature also should analyze classes required for concealed carry permits. Are they thorough?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida law is fairly liberal about training courses required for concealed carry permits. For instance, it allows &quot;any National Rifle Association firearms safety or training course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's too vague. The Legislature needs to take a more proactive approach regarding these and other issues involving violence in the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Denton; Pg. E-1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">860 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This newspaper that aspires to journalism of hope populates its front page with seemingly hopeless stories: A 28-year-old mixed-race Hispanic shoots and kills a black 17-year-old, with racial overtones. A 19-year-old convert to Islam is indicted and arrested for conspiring and attempting to support terrorism, with religious overtones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where is the hope there? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it's in what we as a community learn from those three wasted young lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There actually is some positive that I think came out of the deadly encounter between Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, really from our subsequent conversations and discussions about who was responsible for what in those few dark minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman started the confrontation, ignoring a 911 request to stand back. Martin may have started the violence, banging Zimmerman's head. But Zimmerman brought the gun and pulled the trigger. Both brought attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he approached Martin, Zimmerman profiled what he thought was a hoodie-hiding black burglar on the make. Martin perceived the neighborhood-watch cop-wannabe as a &quot;creepy-ass cracker.&quot; It was dark, and the young men's testosterone fueled what may have been inevitable at that point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case took over TV coverage, water coolers and social media. We've all sorted out our opinions of relative culpability. Mine were aided by serious and constructive discussions in our editorial board and on a panel last week at the Florida Society of News Editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we've learned some things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope, and expect, that neighborhood watch programs across the country have studied the Sanford tragedy and will work harder on selecting and training their volunteers, particularly emphasizing their usual policies of not confronting suspects and not being armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I expect, sadly enough, that black parents will refine &quot;the talk&quot; they have with their sons. &quot;You know that 'talk,' &quot; KJ Dell'Antonia wrote in The New York Times. &quot;The one that has nothing to do with sex, and everything to do with what it means to be a black teenager in a country with a history of regarding young black men as a threat. The talk about standing up straight, dressing the part, keeping your hands in sight at all times and never, ever letting your anger get the best of you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While older people should have learned that a hoodie doesn't connote criminality or danger, maybe younger people will figure out that deliberately taking on thug attire as a style statement can get you perceived as a thug even when you aren't one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another positive is a national discussion on &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, though that didn't play a major role in the Zimmerman trial. The American Bar Association is studying the issue, and protesters, including in Florida, are asking for legislatures to reconsider the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We in journalism also should have learned some things. On that FSNE panel and elsewhere, we were criticized for not covering the Zimmerman case enough before he was charged, and then for covering it too much and sensationalizing it. But then panelists asked us to come back and dig more deeply into some of these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should have learned that not all controversies involving race and court decisions will drive angry black people into the streets. A number of reports speculated in advance on what a not-guilty verdict might mean. I saw TV reporters covering empty streets and marveling that no one had showed up to loot and burn. The Times-Union had contingency plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Orlando Sentinel editor on the panel said she was proud of her staff's truth-checking. &quot;We took a step back every couple of weeks in the beginning and we said, 'What are the ridiculous rumors that are going around out there?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Jacksonville, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force secured a federal indictment charging Shelton Thomas Bell, 19, with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we as a community should learn from that was down in our story: Bell came to the attention of the FBI because he aroused the suspicions of other Muslims at the Islamic Center of Northeast Florida by what he was saying to teenagers about &quot;liberating&quot; Muslims, jihad, training with guns, traveling to Middle East war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A teenager told his dad, who told center leaders, who notified the FBI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parvez Ahmed, board secretary, said &quot;the consistent message from the Islamic Center leadership to the community is: If you see something, say something. Be in communication with your children and alert to signs of radicalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did Bell constitute a threat, or was it just a part of his First Amendment free-speech rights? We turned it over to the experts [the FBI]. We certainly don't want anyone's free-speech rights to be abridged, but we also don't want anyone to incite violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have heard people blame Islam for terrorism and say it is inherent in the religion. They should learn from this episode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are far too many of these stories in our newspaper and websites, but within our reporting and your reading and thoughtful consideration, there is always hope, that we as a society do learn and get better, however frustratingly slowly, one day at a time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was killed sometime after his 71st trimester and it was undoubtedly a tragic loss. But millions of babies are killed before or during their third trimester and the Left celebrates that as a &quot;right&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the N.C. Republican legislature is trying to do is to keep North Carolina from becoming Debt-troit and its abortion clinics from becoming like Dr. Gosnell's. And for that they are vilified? If any &quot;Moocher Monday&quot; protesters don't like it here, I'll gladly buy them a one way ticket to Moretown. They need more wards of the state. By the way, protesters are OK with requiring a photo ID to get an abortion - but not to vote. (Do you think Dr. Gosnell will soon be glamorized on the cover of Rolling Stone?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Holder despises the stand your ground law so much that he urges everyone to exercise a duty to retreat when faced with imminent danger. Exactly where is a baby in the womb supposed to retreat to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memo to President Obama: If I had a daughter she'd look like Eve Carson and if you had two sons they'd look like the men who killed her. That has nothing to do with anything! Two human beings, Eve and Trayvon, lost their lives. By the way, one was a white Caucasian....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You also said Trayvon could have been you 35 years ago, but abortion has prevented millions of babies from becoming anybody 35 years from now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiscally responsible compromise doubtful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Obamacare is] a huge train wreck coming down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, one of its chief architects, back in April. Three months later, with the employer mandate being delayed (forcing more workers to rely on federal subsidies to cope with overheating, profit-driven insurance company premiums on the health exchanges) ... the tracks are starting to separate. Once again, Democrats have proven their eternal ineptitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Republicans - with their multiple sabotage attempts, pointless repeals and repackaging of the status quo - they have underlined their cold-hearted indifference. A patient-centered health law replacement? Is that with or without crosshairs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the business community, Republicans have long opposed the employer mandate (though supported the individual mandate). Now that it has been delayed, they still can't find it within themselves to seize the moment and finally do something constructive on health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bumbling Democrats should offer to make the employer mandate delay permanent. In return, Republicans should agree to allow a robust public option on the health exchanges, which would reduce the cost of - taxpayer funded - federal subsidies and provide real competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fiscally responsible compromise could be achieved, provided both parties step up and sever themselves from the hips of special interests. Doubtful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August will be a defining month for our new governor. The state legislature passed a large number of bills in July. We voted in a conservative Republican majority, so it comes as no surprise that most of the bills reverse long-standing laws enacted by Democrats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat McCrory ran as a Republican moderate, a fiscal conservative to be sure, but a moderate otherwise. He made us campaign promises to that effect. Though we are a &quot;red&quot; state in the media's eyes, most North Carolinians consider themselves middle America, leaning right on some topics and left on others. Our governor now has the opportunity with his pen to sign into law or veto bills that reflect our moderate values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is your chance to speak up. The bill reducing corporate tax rates to attract businesses to North Carolina is now law. Call or email Gov. Pat McCory this week and let your opinions be known on city rights, education funding, early voting, living wage and environmental deregulation. Call the governor's office at 919-814-2000 or email via www.governor.state.nc.us/contact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deliberate obfuscation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to thank Arlene Machen for her perceptive response to the letter by Paul Richardson in The Herald-Sun Saturday, but there's another important point to make about that letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Richardson said that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had been suspended from school because he was found to be in possession of burglary tools. Being unsure of what &quot;burglary tools&quot; meant, I consulted the Internet and learned the &quot;burglary tool&quot; in question was a flat-head screwdriver discovered in Trayvon's backpack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why did Mr. Richardson use the ambiguous term &quot;burglary tool&quot; instead of the more descriptive &quot;flat head screwdriver&quot;? Could it have been a deliberate obfuscation in order to demonize the victim of a vigilante killing?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood's summer tentpole strategy continued to suffer in North America with the muted debut of The Wolverine, but the X-Men spin-off more than made up for it overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20th Century Fox pic opened to $55 million domestically and roughly $86.1 million internationally for a worldwide total of $141.1 million -- easily covering the film's $120 million production budget. Internationally, it posted the strongest opening ever for an X-Men title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine certainly isn't a dud in North America and still claimed the No. 1 position, but came in at least $10 million behind expectations and well behind the $85.1 million opening of X-Men Origins: Wolverine in early May 2009. It opened on par with last summer's X-Men: First Class, an origins pic versus a sequel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows several all-out bombs, including R.I.P.D., White House Down, The Lone Ranger and After Earth, leaving Hollywood studios questioning the sanity of rolling out so many event pics in one summer. Unlike Wolverine, those films haven't been saved by a strong international performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine opened No. 1 in 100 countries, coming in 51 percent bigger than the first Wolverine and 51 percent bigger than last year's origins pic X-Men: First Class. Revenue from 3D screens represented 50 percent of the total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STORY: 5 Ways to Fix the Summer Movie Box-Office Crisis </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine was directed by James Mangold, with Hugh Jackman returning in the title role (the two worked together previously on the 2001 romantic adventure Kate &amp; Leopold).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox is hoping that the movie's long-term outcome will be boosted by strong reviews and a strong A- CinemaScore; X-Men Origins was roundly bashed by critics. Males made up the majority of the audience (58 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The A- CinemaScore and our excellent exit polls are a testament to the high-quality film that James Mangold and Hugh Jackman made. I think Wolverine has advanced to be a very compelling and complex character that audiences have really responded to,&quot; said Fox president of domestic distribution Chris Aronson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other box office observers question whether audience summer fatigue has set in, resulting in the lower turnout for Wolverine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set sometime after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan (Jackman) has renounced his superhero powers and is living as a recluse in the Yukon. However, he's drawn back into the world when a Japanese man he once saved requests to become immortal. He also asks that Logan protect his granddaughter. The movie has yet to open in Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Line's low-budget horror offering The Conjuring dropped a slim 47 percent in its second weekend, grossing $22.1 million to come in No. 2 and pushing its North American total to $83.9 million, the top showing of the year for a horror title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Universal's Despicable Me 2 continued to rule the family market, grossing $16 million in its fourth weekend to best newer offering Turbo, which declined 37 percent in its second weekend to $13.2 million for a domestic total of $55.8 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despicable 2 became only the sixth animated film to cross the $300 million mark in North America, ending Sunday with a total $306.4 million, the second-best showing of the year after Iron Man 3. It's worldwide gross is $660.9 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rounding out the top five was Sony's Adam Sandler ensemble comedy Grown Ups 2, which took in $11.5 million for a domestic total of $101.7, becoming the 14th Sandler film to cross $100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R.I.P.D., from Universal, tumbled 54 percent in its second weekend to come in a dismal No. 9 with $5.9 million. The movie's domestic total through Sunday is a scant $24.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine may have been the only new major release this weekend, but there was a flurry of activity at the specialty box office, including the stellar launch of Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film, headlined by Cate Blanchett, grossed $612,767 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles for a location average of $102,128 -- the best since The Master in September 2012 and ahead of the $99,834 opening location average of Allen's box-office hit Midnight in Paris. Sony Pictures Classics, Allen's longtime distribution partner, is releasing Blue Jasmine in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two high-profile specialty films expanded nationwide this weekend: Fruitvale Station and coming-of-age dramedy The Way, Way Back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STORY: Hugh Jackman Wants Wolverine to Join the Movie 'Avengers' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station, from The Weinstein Co., placed No. 10, grossing $4.7 million from 1,030 theaters for a location average of $4,377 and cume of $6.3 million. Ryan Coogler's critically acclaimed film, prospering in both art house and African-American theaters, recounts the real-life shooting of an unarmed young black man by a BART police officer in Oakland. The film, which should end the weekend with a domestic cume of $6.3 million, has drawn numerous parallels to the Trayvon Martin case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox Searchlight's The Way, Way Back, starring Steve Carell, Toni Colette and Sam Rockwell, placed No. 11 with $3.3 million from 886 theaters for a total of $8.9 million. The film, directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who wrote the script for The Descendants, posted a location average of $3,724.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other new specialty offerings, CBS Films' raunchy comedy The To Do List, starring Aubrey Plaza, opened to an estimated $1.5 million from 591 theaters, a softer-than-expected start.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">707 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was described as a beautiful boy with soulful brown eyes - moral, empathetic and gentle. Captain of the high school wrestling team and nominated to the National Honor Society, he was also a diligent student with high-achieving friends who knew they could call him at 2 a.m. if they needed a favor. &quot;Saving lives brings me joy,&quot; he once tweeted of why he became a lifeguard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sits accused of violently ending several lives, maiming others and inflicting terror with homemade bombs during the Boston Marathon on April 15. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far south of Boston, in Sanford, Fla., under different circumstances, a young man triggered unwarranted alarm in February 2012 merely for wearing a hoodie and walking in a gated community where an onlooker assumed he had no right to be. Because George Zimmerman felt uncomfortable with the young man's appearance, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin ended up dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases, both of which have triggered outrage, have one critical thing in common. Both show how lethally wrong we can be when we try to predict people's behavior according to the stories and stereotypes we've recorded in our heads about how they should or shouldn't look or act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I share the outrage over the fact that the killer of an unarmed black man doing nothing wrong got off without criminal sanction. But the outrage over a Rolling Stone magazine cover photo said to glamorize Tsarnaev is misplaced. In running that rock star-like picture of an accused bomber, Rolling Stone was making precisely this point: Appearances can lie, and terrorists don't necessarily come packaged in long beards as recluses. They can be the popular all-American athlete who smokes dope. They can embrace popular culture. They can even be hunks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on his appearance and what little people knew of him, &quot;terrorist&quot; would not have been an outcome predicted for Tsarnaev. It's not that the friends, teachers and other acquaintances lied. It's that they missed a side he worked to conceal. He was, concluded the Rolling Stone article, a &quot;deeply fractured boy&quot; who didn't start out believing in radical rhetoric, but, &quot;As each small disappointment wore on his family, ultimately ripping them apart, it also furthered Jahar's (his nickname) own disintegration - a series of quiet yet powerful body punches. No one saw a thing.&quot; Had closer attention been paid to the subtler clues Tsarnaev gave out - his sudden embrace of Islam, his contention that 9/11 was &quot;an inside job&quot; and the fact that non-Muslim friends were rarely allowed into his family's apartment, people might have noticed the widening double life he led. Had they observed his gradual process of alienation, disconnectedness and anger, they might have worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who study terrorists say this is how it most often happens. &quot;Rather than say, 'I'm lost, I've got a problem,' it's much easier to find a convenient enemy or scapegoat,&quot; Rolling Stone quotes Tom Neer, a retired FBI agent and now counterterrorism adviser, as saying. &quot;The justification comes later - say, U.S. imperialism or whatever. It's the explanation that is key.&quot; What's important, says Neer, &quot;is looking past their exterior and getting access to that interior.&quot; Who's to say if closer attention to Tsarnaev might have saved the Boston Marathon victims? Our justice system isn't supposed to throw people in jail on mere suspicions. But if those close to him had been attuned and concerned enough about his anger and angst to try and get him help, they might inadvertently have prevented the horrible upshot. Instead, they deferred to outside appearances: The guy was chill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is absolutely clear is that had George Zimmerman not jumped to conclusions about a black kid wearing a hoodie, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still be alive. If there is a lesson to be learned from both tragedies - one of missed clues, the other of overreaction - it's that both kinds of presumptions, about who looks like one of the guys and who doesn't, can be fatally flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profiling leaves innocent people dead. It lets us ignore warning signs of explosive rage brewing in someone close to us. It even, as we have learned, failed to predict a future president. We must stop relying on it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 28--The issue: President Obama reflects on the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our view: The president's call for calm reflection is good advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago,&quot; President Obama said recently during an impromptu visit at a White House press briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was reflecting on the not guilty verdict that freed George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Martin on Super Bowl Sunday 2012 in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The above quote got most of the attention, and in itself did nothing to soothe the tension surrounding the case. Martin, an African-American, was shot by Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer. At some point the two encountered each other and Zimmerman shot Martin. Zimmerman said Martin was beating him, and he acted in self-defense, a claim backed by his bloody face and wounded head. The jury rejected the charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was criticized by some for not speaking out about the verdict, so he finally did. And his comments taken in total were measured and offer sound advice for all of us, black and white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said the issue for blacks is seen &quot;through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot; He added that he has personally experienced the feelings of fear and distrust among whites when he, an African-American male, has walked by them, whether it's women nervously clutching their purses or nearby drivers locking their car doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama called on Americans to undergo a period of &quot;calm reflection&quot; in the wake of this incident. That's not easy, because emotions run deep on the matter of race, and emotional responses can easily make things worse and perpetuate the very stereotypes that may have played a role in triggering Zimmerman's decision to follow Martin and Martin's decision to engage in a physical altercation with Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the best example for young black males is to ask themselves that if Barack Obama could have been any one of them 35 years ago, what choices did Obama make that put him in the White House? The answer, obviously, is that he applied himself, worked hard and got an education. He got to be one of the most highly respected individuals in the world by acting respectable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As columnist Gregory Clay noted in a piece published on these pages last Sunday, even Jesse Jackson has admitted to being relieved when he learns a person walking behind him down the street at night is white. So, it appears, even the utmost champion for racial equality admits to racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking precautions to safeguard yourself and your property is not paranoid no matter where you live. What we'll never know what role race may have played in arousing Zimmerman's suspicions, leading to his call to authorities and the events that followed. Many in the African-American community certainly have their doubts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, Obama doesn't sound eager to see Zimmerman pursued on federal civil rights charges. There is no video as was the case in the Rodney King beating by police in 1991, and absent some new evidence, as Obama said, &quot;Once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said he is hopeful that the next generation will move us closer to where we want to get racially because they aren't as hung up on the stereotypes that scarred previous generations. Let's hope he's right, but we all can do our part by focusing on the content of our own character. If we do that, the color of our skin will become increasingly irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Activists Rising Against Cuts (Barac) co-chair Lee Jasper confirmed the move today after seven days of protests outside the US embassy in London against the racist killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin. Mr Jasper said the Martin killing resonated around the world and cited cases in Britain including the deaths of Stephen Lawrence, Jimmy Mubenga, Mark Duggan, Kingsley Burrell, Smiley Culture and Azelle Rodney. About 350 people joined the London demonstrations demanding justice for Mr Martin, whose killer George Zimmerman was acquitted of manslaughter after claiming self-defence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protests, culminating with a march and rally to Downing Street on Saturday, also backed the Lawrence family's call for a public inquiry into allegations that police attempted to smear them and other anti-racism activists. Mr Jasper said the brutal cuts being implemented by the coalition and other EU states would only exacerbate incidents of racism. &quot;You look at Europe and you can see that austerity has unleashed a tidal wave of racism in Greece, Spain, Italy and Germany and here,&quot; he said. &quot;We have seen a rise in violent racist attacks, the targeting of mosques and the persecution of immigrants. &quot;We have the Tories employing Lynton Crosby and making it very clear they want to demonise immigrants in the run-up to the elections and parties like Ukip spreading their lies about immigration.&quot; Saturday's protest was organised by Barac with support from the Public and Commercial Services union, Unite, the National Union of Teachers and a number of civil liberties and anti-racism groups. The new coalition, which has yet to be named, will be formally launched in September and is aimed at countering the xenophobic rhetoric of parties such as Ukip and the Tories.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is a transcript of an interview with President Obama conducted by Jackie Calmes and Michael D. Shear of The New York Times. The interview was conducted at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., on July 24, 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: So we're here with you, already four years since the recession officially ended. And as your speech sort of laid out, you still have a situation where growth remains slow, income's is unequal, and a lot of American -- unemployment high -- and a lot of Americans start to worry that this is the new normal. Your intentions aside like you stated them out there in the speech, why shouldn't we expect that you're going to leave behind an economy that's fragile, continued income inequality, and a weakened middle class?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Well, obviously, what Congress does matters. As I said in the speech, the economy is far stronger now than it was four and a half years ago. Most economists believe that growth will actually pick up next quarter and the second half of the year. And the one thing that could really screw things up would be if you have a manufactured crisis and Republicans choose to play brinksmanship all over again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'm glad to see that there are folks in the Senate who I think have already indicated that that is not good policy. We can have debates about fiscal issues without precipitating a crisis. Certainly the idea that we wouldn't pay our bills and plunge not just the United States but potentially the world into another financial crisis makes absolutely no sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what I also said out there is true that if we stand pat, if we don't do anything, then growth will be slower than it should be. Unemployment will not go down as fast as it should. Income inequality will continue to rise. Wages, incomes, savings rates for middle-class families will continue to be relatively flat. And that's not a future that we should accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the entire intention of the speech is to make sure that we are focused on the right thing. It doesn't mean that I expect Republicans to agree with all my prescriptions, but it is to say that the central problem we face and the one that we faced now that the immediate crisis is over is how do we build a broad-based prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we've spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: But do you worry, Mr. President, that that description of that sort of standing pat, what happens if you stand pat and the sort of slower than expected -- do you worry that that could end up being your legacy simply because of the obstruction that -- and the gridlock that doesn't seem to end?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Well, let's separate it from me for a second, because I think if I'm arguing for entirely different policies and Congress ends up pursuing policies that I think don't make sense and we get a bad result, it's hard to argue that'd be my legacy. And so I'll worry about my legacy later or I'll let historians worry about my legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do worry about what's happening to ordinary families here is Galesburg and all across the country. When we know that rebuilding our infrastructure right now would put people back to work and it's never been cheaper for us to do so, and this is all deferred maintenance that we're going to have to do at some point anyway, I worry that we're not moving faster to seize the moment. When we know that families are getting killed by college costs, for us not to take bold action -- which means that young people are graduating with massive debt, they can't buy a home as soon as they want, they can't start that business that they've got a great idea for -- that worries me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So as I suggested in the speech, what I want to make sure everybody in Washington is obsessed with is how are we growing the economy, how are we increasing middle-class incomes and middle-class wages, and increasing middle-class security. And if we're not talking about that, then we're talking about the wrong thing. And if our debates around the budget don't have that in mind, then we've got the wrong focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Well, you said it yourself in the speech that Washington has taken its eye off the ball. Do you have any -- are you culpable at all in that? Did you -- it's six -- it's July now, it's almost August. Do you wish you were giving a speech like this earlier and done it more often?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: If you look over the last six months, we right away delivered on the promise to make sure that our tax code was more reflective of our values; that middle-class families locked in relief that they needed; folks like me, at the very top, paid a little bit more. That, by the way, was a fundamental shift that was a decade in the making. That was a big argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after that, obviously, we had the tragedy in Newtown and the need for a response. And my wish and hope had been that that was a quicker piece of business and that we had gone ahead and moved forward on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration reform actually squarely fits into what I'm discussing right now. As I indicated before, we know the economy will grow faster if we get immigration reform done. We know that Social Security will be shored up if we get immigration reform done. And the Senate's done the right thing by passing a strong bipartisan bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what I will absolutely admit to is that I've been here -- I've been in Washington long enough now to know that if once a week I'm not talking about jobs, the economy, and the middle class, then all manner of distraction fills the void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Is there any part of your agenda moving forward that you think you are willing to move to the backburner so that you can spend more time on the economy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Well, immigration reform we've got to get done, and that right now is just a matter of the House Republicans recognizing that both the American people, businesses, labor, evangelicals -- there's a broad consensus to go ahead and pass that bill, and if that bill was on the floor tomorrow it would pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond that, though, we're working on a range of other issues -- from climate change to reforming government to reducing the backlog in the VA. So there's a bunch of stuff we're going to be doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will be spending my time over the next several weeks talking about the issues in more detail that I discussed today so that by the time Congress gets back in the fall, I want to make sure that the American people are paying attention and asking themselves, are we doing everything we can to boost middle-class incomes, ladders of opportunity, and middle-class security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if we're doing that, then ultimately I think that we won't get everything done that I want to see done, but we will have shifted away from what I think has been a bad -- a damaging framework in Washington, which is to constantly think about is there more we can do to cut the deficit without asking are we making the right cuts, the smart cuts that actually help people in their own lives and help us grow over the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Well, in contrast with the jobs plan that's now what you're reflecting today, it's almost two years old now, and which would measurably add to employment the studies show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: But in contrast with that, the policies that have been in place since the start of your second term, fiscal policies --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Right, because of the sequester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: -- that you and Congress agreed to -- right -- and some of the laws -- the payroll tax cut, and the increase in upper-end taxes to some extent -- but all of those things are by any economist's measure a drag on the economy. There's not a day goes by I don't get some analyst saying that -- and that the Fed is pursuing expansionary policies to offset that. How can you -- how are you going to -- what exactly can you do between now and the end of the year to overcome the Republicans' opposition and change that, to end sequester?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Well, let me back up, Jackie. First of all, as the economy got stronger during the course of my presidency, I had always committed to a responsible reduction in the deficit. I think that was the smart thing to do, the right thing to do, and good for our growth. And if we're growing faster, if businesses and the markets have more confidence, then ultimately that benefits middle-class families as well. So I make no apologies for putting forward budgets consistently that, as I had promised, would gradually reduce the deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the sequester I did not want to be in place. When you say I agreed to it, what happened, as you will recall, in 2011 is, is that we had the prospect of either default or a willingness on the part of Republicans and Democrats to spend a year and a half trying to come up with a sensible way to reduce the deficit. The sequester was supposed to be something that was so damaging to the economy that both parties would want to avoid it. The fact that Republicans embraced the sequester as what they consider a win during the course of this year, despite all the damage that they said they wanted to avoid, for example, to our military, is different from me agreeing to the sequester. All right? So that's point number one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Point number two, every economist will tell you that if we are being smart about growth and we're thinking about jobs and we're thinking about the middle class, but we're also thinking about fiscal responsibility, then what we should be doing is making sure that the drop-off in government spending on vital things like education and infrastructure don't go down too fast, and that rather we look at what the real problem is, which is long-term health care costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the Affordable Care Act and a lot of changes that are taking place out there among providers, we're starting to see health care costs slow. That's a positive. If we can build on that, then we can capture the same amount of savings that we're capturing through the sequester and use those to make sure that we're not cutting vital investments that I talked about today, and we can help middle-class families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, I think there are probably going to be 15 different ways for you guys to ask me the same question, which is, ''But there's Congress.'' (Laughter.) More specifically, ''There's the House Republicans, and what are you going to do about that?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Who are still embracing sequestration and who are still willing to use the debt limit to go to the mat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Well, this is what they say. On the other hand, we also have a number of very thoughtful and sensible Republicans over in the Senate who have said that we should not play brinksmanship, that we should come up with a long-term plan. I met with a couple of House Republicans over the last several weeks who would like to see that happen. They're not the loudest voices in the room at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And part of what I'd like to see over the next several weeks is, if we're having a conversation that's framed as how are we growing the economy, how are we strengthening the middle class, how are we putting people back to work, how are we making college more affordable, how are we bringing manufacturing back -- the answer to those questions I think force a different result than if we are constantly asking ourselves how can we cut the deficit more, faster, sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Have you yielded anything from your outreach to Republicans? And do you still have hope for a 10-year deal by the end of the year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: I think it's still possible. There are certainly Republicans who are deeply concerned about the effects of sequester. It's been interesting -- I've talked to a number of them who are from deeply red states, consider themselves very conservative, who say it doesn't make sense for us to cut discretionary spending more; it doesn't make sense for us to cut education further -- because they're seeing the impacts in their districts. Certainly there are a bunch of Republicans who say for us to hollow out our military as steeply, drastically as we're doing if sequester stays in place for next year makes no sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if the American people have confidence that there's a path that will grow the economy faster, put more people back to work, that doesn't involve massive new federal spending programs, but instead just make sure that we're investing in the right things, and if we're being attentive to debt and deficits over a 20, 30-year time horizon, then potentially some of those Republicans start giving voice to their concerns a little more loudly than they're doing right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one of the challenges, as I said in the speech, is that there's almost a kneejerk habit right now that if I'm for it, then they've got to be against it. And I think there are a lot of Republicans who are frustrated by that, because they want to be for something, not just against something. But they've got to work through that pattern that's developed over the last couple of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: A couple of slightly different topics. On the economy, the Fed is obviously an important player. You've got a big decision ahead of yourself in terms of the chairman. What are you looking for in a chairman? And there were reports yesterday that you are very close to naming Larry Summers as the new Fed chairman. True?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: I have not made a final decision. I've narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Do you want to say who?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: No. (Laughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: I tried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: And what I'm looking for is somebody who understands the Fed has a dual mandate, that that's not just lip service; that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets. But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract. The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and there's still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, let's make sure that we're growing the economy, but let's also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, let's make sure that we're not creating new bubbles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: And do you have a timeline in mind for announcing that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: I think you can anticipate that over the next several months, an announcement will be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Bernanke, by the way, has done a fine job as Fed chairman. And when you look at Ben Bernanke's testimony, not just last week but over the last couple of years, what he's consistently said is right now, our priority needs to be growing the economy faster and strengthening incomes for ordinary Americans. If we do that, our deficits come down because we're bringing in more revenue. If we do that, it becomes easier for us to handle the long-term fiscal challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one of the interesting things that we don't talk about enough is the contrast between what's happened in the United States and what's happened in a lot of other developing countries, Europe in particular. It's pretty rare where we have the chance to look at two policy approaches and follow them over several years and see which one worked. And the fact is there are a lot of European countries who followed the prescription that the House Republicans are calling for right now, and not only have they lagged well below where we've gone in terms of growth, in many cases their debt and their deficits have actually gone up because their economy is still effectively in recession. And although we haven't been growing as fast as we would like, we have consistently outperformed those countries that followed the recipe that the House Republicans are offering right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, I'm more sympathetic to those European countries because they, in some cases, didn't have a choice. They don't have the dominant world currency. They don't have people who want to invest in their countries the way folks around the world still want to invest in ours. But in some ways, we've got evidence here. This is not an abstract argument. We know what's needed to make our economy grow right now. And if we grow our economy, and middle-class families are doing better, and housing prices are stronger, and young people are starting families of their own and they're jobs at good wages, that's the thing that will bring deficits down the fastest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: A couple other quick subjects that are economic-related. Keystone pipeline -- Republicans especially talk about that as a big job creator. You've said that you would approve it only if you could be assured it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon in the atmosphere. Is there anything that Canada could do or the oil companies could do to offset that as a way of helping you to reach that decision?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Michael, Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that's true. And my hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Yet there are a number of unions who want you to approve this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Well, look, they might like to see 2,000 jobs initially. But that is a blip relative to the need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they can't ship some of that oil to world markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, having said that, there is a potential benefit for us integrating further with a reliable ally to the north our energy supplies. But I meant what I said; I'm going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: And if they did, could that offset the concerns about the pipeline itself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: We haven't seen specific ideas or plans. But all of that will go into the mix in terms of John Kerry's decision or recommendation on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: And then -- I'll let Jackie go -- but on the employer mandate, I don't think you've been asked the question directly why you made the decision to delay it, and whether, given your criticism of President Bush over the years for potentially exceeding his executive authority, there's been a lot of folks out there on the Republican side who claim that somehow you've exceeded your authority on this. Is there anything to that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Well, this was a very practical decision that actually doesn't go to the heart of us implementing the Affordable Care Act. The majority of employers in this country provide health insurance to their employees. And the number of employers who are potentially subject to the employer mandate is relatively small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way the law was originally written, it did not take into account the fact that we don't necessarily need to load up the vast majority of companies that are already doing the right thing with a bunch of additional paperwork; are there simpler ways for us to allow them to certify that they're providing health insurance? And if they do that, then the purpose, the spirit of the law is met, and we can concentrate on the few bad actors who are unwilling to provide health insurance to their employees even though they can afford it, and they're relatively large employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And businesses came to us and said, listen, we were supportive of providing health insurance to employees, in fact, we provide health insurance to our employees; we understand you want to get at the bad actors here, but are there ways to provide us some administrative relief? And what we said was, given that that is not critical to standing up the marketplaces where people are going to actually be able to buy lower-cost, high-quality insurance and get the tax credits that make it affordable for them, we thought it made sense to give another year not only for companies to prepare, but also for us to work with Treasury and others to see if there are just ways we can make this a little bit simpler for companies who are already doing the right thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program that's starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody. The fact that something like this generates a frenzy on Republicans is consistent with the fact that they've voted to repeal this thing 38 times without offering a alternative that is plausible. And from what I understand, based on recent reporting, they've just given up on offering an alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So essentially -- their central economic plan that they're currently presenting involves making sure that 50 million Americans cannot get health insurance; that people with preexisting conditions are potentially locked out of the market; that the rebates that people have received from insurance companies are sent back; that young people who are right now on their parents' plan because they're 26 or under, that they suddenly don't have health insurance. I do not understand the argument that that somehow grows the economy or strengthens the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And during the course of implementation, are there going to be some glitches? Are there going to be some complaints from employers who are still trying to figure it out and may not know what subsidies are available to them? Absolutely. Are there some folks who may say, we're going to try to figure out ways not to provide health insurance to our employees? Yes. But that's a small proportion of our overall economy, and the principle that everybody should be able to get health insurance is one that the vast majority of Americans agree with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally -- to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Jackie, if you heard me on stage today, what I said was that I will seize any opportunity I can find to work with Congress to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: No, but specifically --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: -- but where Congress is unwilling to act, I will take whatever administrative steps that I can in order to do right by the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if Congress thinks that what I've done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, they're free to make that case. But there's not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency. And I don't think that's a secret. But ultimately, I'm not concerned about their opinions -- very few of them, by the way, are lawyers, much less constitutional lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am concerned about the folks who I spoke to today who are working really hard, are trying to figure out how they can send their kids to college, are trying to make sure that they can save for their retirement. And if I can take steps on their behalf, then I'm going to do so. And I would hope that more and more of Congress will say, you know what, since that's our primary focus, we're willing to work with you to advance those ideals. But I'm not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Polls this week have shown your health care law has lost support. What are you going to be doing to build support?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: We're going to implement it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Are you going to be getting out on the road?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Here is what will build support, given that we've been outspent four to one from the other side with all kinds of distortions about health care. Here is what we're going to do to beat back that misinformation. On October 1st, people are going to be able to start signing up. And if right now they're buying insurance on the individual market, they're going to get on those computers or they're going to make a phone call to one of these call centers and they're going to find out that they can save 20 percent, 30 percent, or 50 percent on their premiums. And people who have not been able to get insurance before are going to be able to finally get insurance. And people who lose their jobs in the interim and find out that they've got a preexisting condition, it's hard for them to get insurance or they can't afford COBRA, they're going to have a place to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And over the course of six months to a year, as people sign up, and it works, and lo and behold, the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care, and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the ''sky is falling'' predictions that come from the other side do not happen, then health care will become more popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But until then, when we're getting outspent four to one and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them, we're going to continue to have some polls like that. And me just making more speeches explaining it in and of itself won't do it. The test of this is going to be is it working. And if it works, it will be pretty darn popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: March on Washington coming up soon. Are you going to do anything to mark it? Are you planning on being a part of the 50th anniversary?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Absolutely. It's obviously a historic, seminal event in the country. It's part of my generation's formative memory and it's a good time for us to do some reflection. Obviously, after the Trayvon Martin case, a lot of people have been thinking about race, but I always remind people -- and, in fact, I have a copy of the original program in my office, framed -- that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn't just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot. It was Walter Reuther and the UAW coming down here because they understood that if there are some workers who are not getting a fair deal then ultimately that's going to undercut their ability to get a fair deal. And if there's one thing that I wanted to try to emphasize today in this speech, it is that America has always worked better when everybody has a chance to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had a conversation a couple of weeks back with a guy named Robert Putnam, who I've known for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: He was my professor actually at Harvard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Right. I actually knew Bob when I was a state senator and he had put together this seminar to just talk about some of the themes that he had written about in ''Bowling Alone,'' the weakening of the community fabric and the impact it's having on people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the work he's doing right now has to do with this issue of inequality. And it applies to a city like Galesburg, where 30 years ago, anybody in this town who wanted to find a job, they could go get a job. They could go get it at the Maytag plant. They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kids here all went to the same school -- the banker's kid and the guy working at the Maytag plant's going to the same school. They've got the same social support. College is affordable for all of them. They don't have to take out $100,000 of debt to do it. And there was a sense of not upward mobility in the abstract; it was part and parcel of who we were as Americans. And that's what's been eroding over the last 20, 30 years, well before the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the financial crisis made things a lot worse. And so I had to spend the first four years in my presidency getting us back to ground level. We had to make sure the banking system wasn't collapsing. We had to make sure the auto industry didn't collapse. We had to make sure that we put people back to work short term and boosted demand until the markets got going and consumers got more confident and housing started to recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so here we are, having dealt with this massive crisis, but those trends -- that erosion of what a Galesburg or a [Port]* Clinton, Ohio, where Bob Putnam lived -- those trends have continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's what people sense. That's why people are anxious. That's why people are frustrated. That's what they talk to me about and that's what they write to me about: ''I'm doing okay right now, but what I've seen over the last 20 years and what I learned profoundly during this crisis is that the ground under my feet just isn't as secure, and that the work I'm doing may not be rewarded.'' And everything that I am proposing and everything I will be proposing over the next three years goes right at that issue. And if that's not what Washington's talking about, then we will be missing the boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And racial tensions won't get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if they've got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction. And so a lot of the other issues that we're talking about -- whether it's climate change or immigration, or how we manage our trade relations -- all those are eased if we've got our economic act together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's not what we talk about. And it's true that Congress moves at such a glacial pace these days that sometimes if you start a bill like immigration and you're thinking this should be done by now, it seems to take a year of folks just sitting around spinning their wheels, that can be frustrating. But we should be able to attend to some of these other issues even as we're staying focused on this central issue. That's at least what I'm going to be doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYT: Thank you, Mr. President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. OBAMA: Thanks, guys. Appreciate you.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. needs action, not speeches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the adjectives I would use to describe President Obama -- intelligent, articulate, charming, good father and husband -- I now have come to realize, after four-plus years of watching and listening to him, that the best adjective I would use now is &quot;boring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, he is scheduled to fly all over the country to make speeches about the economy, and no doubt Obamacare. His speeches are beginning to sound like all the adult characters in a Charlie Brown cartoon. His delivery is always eloquent, and the crescendo builds to a climax like a July 4 fireworks show, but in thethat's all it is: a show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even his most steadfast supporters on the various cable news networks seem to be noticing that he has a lot more bark than bite. Every time they speak about him, they are increasingly saying, &quot;what the president needs to do,&quot; not &quot;what the president needs to say.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may be America's first black president, and he sure promised he was going to be different, but other than the color of his skin I can't differentiate him from the boring, white, golf-playing, Washington elitists that have been running this country into the ground for years -- Democrats and Republicans alike. As a Republican I have had to admit to myself, and now others, that George W. Bush (though a good man) was quite the disappointment. Is it not time that Democrats admit that President Obama is too. I, like many others, am considering changing my registration to independent. We need real change!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An easy -- and almost shorter -- drive east to Daytona Beach is to get off Interstate 4 at exit 114, cross over I-4 and turn right at the first light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Beltway, which turns into Kepler Road, and takes you right to U.S. 92.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then you are home free into Daytona Beach, without stopping for accident delays or slowdowns on I-4 east.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman overstepped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What part of George Zimmerman's case do people miss? He was not a cop, but acted like one. He went out with a gun to try to stop &quot;suspects.&quot; Doing that -- no matter how you may love law and order - - was not his job. Thus, untrained as he was, he set up a situation that put himself in danger. If you don't flee danger, but instead pursue it, and the result is that you kill someone who was minding his own business until you bothered him, you should be held responsible. These seem to me to be the facts. But in my opinion, I feel Zimmerman got off because he was:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A white man of privilege,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Supported by the white power structure and cops,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protected by laws that foster gun violence -- not self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of us are troubled by that, others are outraged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on preventable deaths</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The publicity over the shooting of Trayvon Martin is being overdone. Most of this publicity is being pushed by Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson. To quote Sheriff Mike Scott of Lee County, in a letter to the Lee County branch of the NAACP:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A leading cause of death for young black males across our nation is murder, and an astounding percentage are being murdered by young black males. Tragically, record numbers of young, black males have been gunned down in the streets of Fort Myers and an epidemic of alarming proportions over the past few years. In virtually every instance the killer was also black and the majority of those cases remain open. Many more black citizens have been injured and were lucky to survive similar circumstances. To date I am unaware of any appreciable attention or public outcry the NAACP locally or nationally has afforded these issues in our own proverbial backyard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they want to do some good, they need to go to places like Chicago and New York and start working there to reduce some of the killings. In 2012, there were 506 murders in Chicago and 419 murders in New York. In Chicago, there were 54 shot dead during the George Zimmerman trial. I don't see Jackson or Sharpton up there publicizing that. I wonder if they feel that those people's lives are worth less than Martin's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way, Chicago has one of the toughest gun control laws in the country and so does New York City. It seems obvious from all of the killings in Chicago and New York that gun control is not working. If all these well-meaning people protesting Martin's death and Zimmerman's acquittal put their efforts into stemming the killings where it is an everyday occurrence, they might do more good.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work todivision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing up during the 1950s and 1960s, my neighborhood was mixed white, black and Hispanic. Racism and segregation were not issues. I didn't consider my friends and neighbors as white, black or tan. We played kids' games, attended school and church, rode buses, ate lunch and dinner at each others' homes. We grew up together, were drafted, or joined the armed services to serve our country in time of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was raised in the Christian faith. Because of my beliefs, I became involved with the anti-war and civil rights movements. America was a divided nation; on one side those who believed in peace and equality for all, and on the other, those who opposed those beliefs. Protesters were often beaten, bloodied and trampled or assaulted with fire hoses, rubber bullets and dogs. Some lost their lives. Those who supported these beliefs were also labeled as unAmerican, unpatriotic or traitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty years have passed since then and America has become a more united country, electing the first black man as its president. Those who now believe that the president is taking sides and bringing race into question, who believe that he is dividing the nation, are dead wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of Americans want an honest discussion and debate on race. The talking heads (the Rushes, Hannities and Becks) who preach fear, hatred and division daily don't speak for the majority of Americans. One must ask them this question: If America is truly a Christian nation, will we be able to overcome fear and hatred of people of color and differing sexual orientation?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One solution to gridlock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In seeking answers to the action and non-action in Congress, I firmly believe that one of the best answers to get Congress to do what is needed for our country is term limits. Term limits would stop all the politicking that goes on in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elect all senators and congressional representatives to one four- year term -- staggered -- and then don't let them run for elected office ever again. They should be paid a reasonable salary and should have to buy their own health insurance on the open market and pay into Social Security just like all the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would do several things. Not being able to run for office ever again, they would have to give their full time and attention to the job at hand. Politics as we know it would be vastly curtailed. Re-election is now foremost on the minds of the officeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special interest groups would still lobby but the officeholder (not being able to run again) would be more inclined to do the right thing for the general public rather than worry about the needed money for their re-election. Term limits would change the seniority for chairmanship of committees, passing around these jobs from person-to-person every couple of years instead of one person holding the position for many decades, depending on majority party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of change to our system would have to come from the grassroots of society. Many of the current legislators would fight this idea very hard, so as to keep their cushy positions. We need people in office who will do the job they were elected to do, keeping in mind what is best for the majority of the citizens that they represent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the president chides Washington for having &quot;taken its eye off the ball,&quot; declaring the economy would be the &quot;highest priority&quot; of his second term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, Mr. Obama, I've got some news for you -- you are Washington! While the president's rhetoric is absolutely magnificent, his follow-through or lack thereof has weakened our economic recovery, strangled small business, and polarized our nation. Poised to spend almost $684 million to market and sell Obamacare to a skeptical populace, the president will continue to advocate his progressive agenda despite the severe consequences to our country's economy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Sunday's story on Florida Blue's proposal to become a mutual insurance holding company (&quot;Nonprofit insurer pays millions to 14 executives&quot;) gave short shift to the organization's 70-year track record of innovation, community leadership and commitment to Floridians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article focused on the improbable risks associated with the often-used holding company structure without equal review of the many benefits Floridians would see with reorganization. As Florida Blue explains, restructuring would give the company more flexibility to compete with for-profit insurers and to offer new products, making health coverage more affordable. Other insurance companies have reorganized in a similar fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Affordable Care Act has drastically changed the health care equation, placing new requirements and rules on all of us, and it seems only logical that insurers like Florida Blue should be allowed to adapt to this new reality. A review of the company's proposal shows that while its structure would change, its fundamental mission would endure; it would continue to operate as a not-for-profit, policyholder-owned organization focused on helping people and communities achieve better health. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its insurance operations would continue under the oversight of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, and we would be wise to allow that body to complete its review of the application in an open environment. Florida Blue has stated that it would not change its policyholders' rights, and that its application includes an evaluation of certain risks only because regulators require a &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After decades of serving those most in need in our state, and after proving their commitment to our community through their donations of time and resources -- something I have witnessed firsthand -- Florida Blue has earned the right to have its proposal reviewed fairly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's note: Tony Argiz is chairman and CEO of the accounting firm Morrison, Brown, Argiz &amp; Farra. Florida Blue is the company's insurance carrier. Mr. Argiz is a former board chairman of United Way of Miami-Dade and the Orange Bowl Committee, and is the current chairman of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premiums making executives rich</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your articles on Florida Blue make be blue. To think that the monthly premiums I pay to the company for my secondary medical coverage -- we are retired and also pay for Medicare -- go to pay million-dollar salaries and to politicians ($4.8 million in 2012) is outrageous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What if these extravagant expenditures were used for medical research, paying for actual medical costs, or, heaven forbid, to help lower premiums? Where do these &quot;executives&quot; and regulatory officials find their moral compass, especially when we are talking about a not-for-profit? Shame.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed Florida Blue reorganization should be DOA. This is just another sad, and all too frequent, example of the few seeking to benefit at the expense of the many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Joe Abruzzo, D-Wellington, and his cohorts in the Legislature should be ashamed of themselves for so brazenly shirking their responsibility to the folks who elected them and trusted their judgment. They approved legislation to help Florida Blue, all for the sake of a campaign contribution payback (&quot;Insurance rule lacked scrutiny, critics say&quot;).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;Twinkies return to stores&quot;: When my mom packed my lunch, she always included a Hostess Twinkie. You did not have to share them, because we all seemed to have one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I bought a box of the &quot;new&quot; Twinkies. I was not thrown back to my childhood. I was thrown by the hype and the fact that you can chew this thing -- that is a lot smaller than I remember -- forever. The calorie count is down from 150 to 135, but I could not bring myself to have a second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read the ingredients. There is nothing &quot;real.&quot; There are preservatives that only a nutritionist who graduated in the top half of her class would understand. They do, however, have the redeeming fact that their shelf life has gone from 26 days to 45 days. Those preservatives must be very potent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Randy Schultz's column, &quot;Without a gun, there is no tragedy&quot;: I will always believe that if George Zimmerman, as captain of the neighborhood watch, had followed the Sanford police instructions, stayed in his truck and not followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, this whole event would not have happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case means that, in Florida, if you have a gun and a concealed carry permit, you can initiate a confrontation with a second person. If that person stands his ground, then begins to gain an advantage, you can shoot and kill and claim self-defense. Why don't we start renaming our cities Dodge and Tombstone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But changing this law will not be easy. The NRA wants &quot;stand your ground&quot; to remain intact. The NRA controls the Republican Party which, in turn, controls Florida, with the governor and a majority in the House and Senate. It will be easier to change legislators in 2014 than the legislation now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman case has inspired considerable debate about race in the criminal justice system. This is an important debate. However, another debate should also happen. This is over the epidemic of gun violence in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Cosby made an important point soon after the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He stated that the one thing we know about the case is that if George Zimmerman did not have a gun, no one would have died that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This country is awash in guns. We must begin to move toward tighter regulation of guns in this country. The Machin-Toomey bill, which closes the gun show loophole, would be a good beginning.</SPAN></P>

If I had shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, I would feel badly about it, but I would be alive. Self-defense is the defense that was argued, and that is why he was found not guilty, no other reason.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider this: A guy comes at you with a gun, knife or club, and you shoot him. You claim self-defense, but the prosecutor raises questions about your ability to retreat. You have to prove your innocence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So now, eight years too late, they want to say how they really feel about &quot;stand your ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As The Post reported Friday, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg and gubernatorial candidate Nan Rich believe that the Legislature should fix the self-defense law they blindly voted for in 2005 as Democratic state senators. Some might say they have come to their senses. More likely, their decision was about politics then and is about politics now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand your ground drastically expanded the right of self-defense in Florida, in three ways. No longer did someone who feared for his or her life have a duty to retreat before using deadly force if in fear of &quot;great bodily harm.&quot; No longer did the &quot;castle doctrine&quot; apply just in one's home; it applied anywhere someone happened to be. Finally, stand your ground protected someone who used the law as a successful defense from being sued in civil court for wrongful death. It is a unique immunity defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a change should not have come without lots of debate, with sponsors forced to justify the need for such a change. None of that happened. The law passed just halfway through the legislative session. The National Rifle Association wanted it, and Democrats wanted to show that they could kiss up to the NRA just like Republicans. One senator said this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even voters who are hurt by Republican economic priorities vote Republican because they don't trust us on cultural wedge issues like gun control and religion. The voters stop listening to us, and they don't even get to our economic issues. So we're trying to show that, if you are a gun owner, you are a Democrat, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That senator was Mr. Aronberg, who basically was admitting that Democrats were ignoring possible public safety consequences of the law, which should have been a bipartisan concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Aronberg wasn't alone. Nan Rich and every other Democrat in the Senate voted with him. So did plenty of Democrats in the House. One from the Panhandle joined the horde that co-sponsored the House version, saying that while the bill &quot;might go a little far, it sends a message that Democrats believe in the same core values&quot; as Republicans. Such as recklessness? The bill passed 39-0 in the Senate and 94-20 in the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One could argue that since the armed George Zimmerman killed the unarmed Trayvon Martin 17 months ago -- stand your ground was not invoked at trial but influenced the jury instructions -- Florida has had a belated debate on stand your ground. Gov. Rick Scott created a task force that held hearings. But the governor stacked the panel with stand your ground supporters, and it recommended no significant changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not coincidentally, however, the two panel members most skeptical of stand your ground were a prosecutor and a criminal court judge. Miami-Dade County State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle wrote that the law should not provide self-defense protection for those who provoke a confrontation, as George Zimmerman did. Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Krista Marx, a former prosecutor, said the law is too broad and vague. What is &quot;great bodily harm&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backing them up last year was a spokesman for the National Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. It has opposed parts of stand your ground. &quot;Before,&quot; the spokesman said, &quot;you would have an objective standard: What would a prudent person have done in a similar situation? And now, it's more of a subjective test: You have to get inside the mind of the person that has used deadly force.&quot; Because, of course, the object of that deadly force is unable to give his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2005, supporters of stand your ground provided no case of a Floridian who had been unjustly prosecuted after claiming self-defense. The Tampa Bay Times demolished the example some backers cited, that of a Pensacola man who shot a drunken intruder after Hurricane Ivan. The shooter never hired a lawyer, and wasn't charged. One state senator said the man's stress justified the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hype and fear prevailed. Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, who served on the task force, said in 2005: &quot;Some violent rape will not occur because somebody will feel empowered by this bill. Somebody's child will not be abducted. ... You're going to prevent a murder.&quot; During all those task force meetings, Rep. Baxley offered no examples of stand your ground preventing a rape, abduction or murder. He claimed that the law was responsible for the drop in violent crime that was happening well before stand your ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Aronberg blamed judges for expanding stand your ground beyond &quot;what the Legislature intended.&quot; In fact, warnings came in 2005 -- one came from Priscilla Taylor, then a Democratic House member and now a Palm Beach County commissioner. Interestingly, the man who preceded Mr. Aronberg as state attorney is a big critic of stand your ground. Pete Antonacci now is Gov. Scott's chief counsel. Perhaps Mr. Antonacci can persuade the governor to say and do something about stand your ground before it's too late.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARRISBURG </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 2014, Gov. Tom Corbett is defeated by Democrat Allyson Schwartz. In this hypothetical scenario, Schwartz then serves alongside fellow Democrat Kathleen Kane, the state attorney general. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawsuit is filed challenging the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, approved in 2011 by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Corbett, a Republican. It provides an expanded claim of self-defense for shooting an assailant outside the home - on the street, in a car, in the office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kane recently announced she won't defend the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's 1996 law banning gay marriage. She said she could not ethically do so because it is unconstitutional. Under the Commonwealth Attorney's Act, which established the Office of Attorney General, Kane said she is allowed to delegate defense of a lawsuit. It's sent to the General Counsel's Office, which is under the governor. Many matters routinely are deferred. But defending the constitutionality of a statute might be different, former attorneys general say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AG's office was established through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 1978. The office was set up separately because Pennsylvanians, fed up with corruption under the Milton Shapp administration, wanted to see the attorney general operate independent of the governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So under the hypothetical scenario described above, Kane delegates the case to the general counsel under Schwartz (or any liberal Democrat). But since the general counsel works for the governor, the governor then tells the general counsel he or she is opposed to the stand your ground law and defers to the attorney general. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The net result: Neither the commonwealth's top lawyer, the attorney general, nor the governor's lawyer defend the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not far-fetched given the uproar over the George Zimmerman case and the killing of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Florida jury's acquittal of Zimmerman on murder and manslaughter charges prompted calls across the nation for repeal of stand your ground laws. More than 20 other states, including Pennsylvania, have laws similar to Florida's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the commonwealth doesn't defend the law, the plaintiff would win by default. (Any third, private party that might step in to defend the law likely would be found to have no standing.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top state lawyer should defend a law approved by the General Assembly and signed by the governor. Lawyers regularly defend cases and defendants they find reprehensible. They are advocates. The attorney general is paid to defend state law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kane's move was bold. Pennsylvania polls show a shift toward acceptance of gay marriage. That, however, is not the point. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PLEASE DON'T SHOOT ME</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satirist Andy Borowitz at The Borowitz Report: &quot;Opponents of Florida's Stand Your Ground law are attempting to mobilize support for a new law called Don't Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason. The proposed law, which faces major opposition in the Florida legislature, would make it illegal for people in the state to shoot each other for no reason whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; 'Under the provisions of Don't Shoot Me for Absolutely No Reason, you will be required to have an actual reason for shooting someone,' said a spokesman for the measure, Harland Dorrinson. 'This will be a first in Florida.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The controversial bill has already drawn the ire of the National Rifle Association, which issued a statement today saying that requiring someone to have a reason to shoot another person would violate the Second Amendment. 'If you force someone to have a reason to shoot someone, soon you will be taking away his right to shoot that person altogether,' the NRA said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLACK LEADERS DIMINISHED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shelby Steele in The Wall Street Journal: &quot;The verdict that declared George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon Martin was a traumatic event for America's civil-rights establishment, and for many black elites ... When you have grown used to American institutions being so intimidated by the prospect of black wrath that they invent mushy ideas like 'diversity' and 'inclusiveness' simply to escape that wrath, then the crisp reading of the law that the Zimmerman jury displayed comes as a shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On television in recent weeks you could see black leaders from every background congealing into a chorus of umbrage and complaint. But they weren't so much outraged at a horrible injustice as they were affronted by the disregard of their own authority. The jury effectively said to them, 'You won't call the tune here. We will work within the law.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's black leadership pretty much lives off the fumes of moral authority that linger from its glory days in the 1950s and '60s. The Zimmerman verdict lets us see this and feel a little embarrassed for them. Consider the pathos of a leadership that once transformed the nation now lusting for the conviction of the contrite and mortified George Zimmerman, as if a stint in prison for him would somehow assure more peace and security for black teenagers everywhere. This, despite the fact that nearly one black teenager a day is shot dead on the South Side of Chicago -- to name only one city -- by another black teenager.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITTSBURGH, LOOKING GOOD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional economist Chris Briem at his Null Space blog looks at media coverage comparing Pittsburgh's resurgence with Detroit's demise. He posts a video of Mayor Luke Ravenstahl talking about Pittsburgh's &quot;lessons for Detroit&quot; on Bloomberg Television and writes: &quot;You know, I believe Pittsburgh is getting more and more positive earned media out of Detroit's bankruptcy than we did from the whole G20 gig. Beyond the list of media mentions already, Bloomberg today gives lots of air to the Pittsburgh story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POP GOES YOUR VOTE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dahlia Lithwick at Slate on North Carolina's runaway GOP legislature: &quot;The voter ID component of the bill is probably the most draconian in the nation. It cuts to seven the forms of permissible identification. If it passes, no county or municipal government or public employee IDs will be valid proof of voter identification. Nor will any photo ID issued by a public assistance agency or any student ID from any college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new voter ID rules will hit African-American voters, women and Democrats hardest. The indispensable Ari Berman sums up the aggregate effect as follows: 'According to the state's own numbers, 316,000 registered voters don't have state-issued ID; 34 percent are African American and 55 percent are registered Democrats. Of the 138,000 voters without ID who cast a ballot in the 2012 election, 36 percent were African American and 59 percent registered Democrats.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the scourge of voter fraud in North Carolina, at which the proposed law is directed? Between 2000 and 2010 there have been two cases of alleged voter impersonation. In that period three people also ate pop rocks and died.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, politicians are calling again for a national conversation on race. Previous attempts at this conversation have often broken down. Let's learn from our mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of my colleagues, here are some suggestions for thinking and talking about race and racism. I'm white, and so are the vast majority of my colleagues, so most of this advice is written from and to a white perspective. But I hope everyone will find something useful in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't freak out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When somebody accuses you of racism, it's natural to get angry and deny it. Relax. We'll never be able to talk about this stuff if racism is always a firing offense. Treat racism the way you'd treat sexism. You can have sexist moments or sexist blinders without being a pig. Inadvertent sexism is something you're allowed to work on. Racism should be the same. The way you're talking about that &quot;nice African-American gentleman&quot;? Yeah, that's a little bit racist. Don't get defensive. Just understand why and try to do better next time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treat each person as an individual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't tie yourself in knots trying to be politically correct. There's no special way you're supposed to treat this or that group. Just remember what Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned 50 years ago: a nation in which people would be judged not &quot;by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&quot; That's the ultimate principle. Resist inferences based on classification. Judge each person on his or her merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Practice what you preach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody likes to be accused of racism. The best way to open hearts, eyes and minds is to apply the same scrutiny to everyone, including yourself. If you want people to see racial bias in George Zimmerman's reference to &quot;punks,&quot; don't rationalize Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's use of &quot;cracker.&quot; No, these terms aren't equivalent. Yes, Mr. Zimmerman is the one who pulled the trigger. Yes, white-on-black racism dwarfs black-on-white racism. But if your goal is to persuade, get past the differences. Focus on shared failings, shared lessons and shared rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't pretend you're perfect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're racially colorblind, great. But it's more likely that you're human like the rest of us. Studies have documented pervasive, unconscious racial bias even among people with pure hearts. That's understandable, given our history and the common tendency toward intergroup bias. To overcome this bias, you have to notice it. You don't have to think about it all the time -- that would make your interactions weird. But every now and then, reflect on things you've done or said. The seat you walked past on the bus, next to that woman. The way you tightened up as you passed that guy on the street. What was that about? Little by little, you'll clean yourself up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be forgiving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People have been uncomfortable around race for a long time. Some will presume, accuse, rationalize or deny. Others will speak obtusely or ineptly. Resist the urge to rebuke them. Summon the grace to forgive. Don't just correct people; change them. You'll get your message across more effectively through kindness, good humor and clear but friendly engagement than through confrontation. And by listening, you might learn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put yourself in the other person's shoes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you hear President Barack Obama when he talked about the Martin case?: There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African-American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. ... There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, like me, you've never had any of those experiences, imagine how they feel. Imagine how you'd react to the story of a young man like you, your brother or your son being suspected, followed and killed. How can you comprehend the outcry over Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death without understanding that feeling? You don't have to shut up about the case. But try to understand where others are coming from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separate the issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal case against George Zimmerman is related to, but different from, nationwide problems affecting young black men. Everyday personal prejudice is related to, but different from, ways in which our institutions -- schools, markets, sentencing laws -- exacerbate racial gaps. Black-on-black violence, like white-on-white violence, is a bigger killer than white-on-black profiling, but all three problems are real. It's a lot easier to discuss these questions intelligently once you distinguish them and stop using one issue to drown out the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race isn't everything, but race isn't nothing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversations about cases such as this one often get bogged down in a fight between &quot;This is about racism&quot; and &quot;You think everything's about race.&quot; Let's drop the caricatures. Consciously or not, race influences many things: Mr. Zimmerman's suspicions, Mr. Martin's reactions, the police response and the jury's inferences. But other factors also come into play: vigilantism, concealed firearms, self-defense laws and 911 protocols. Race isn't the whole story. But if you leave it out, you're kidding yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't polarize</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world isn't black and white. The U.S. population is 17 percent Hispanic/Latino, 13 percent black, 5 percent Asian, 1 percent Native American and 2 percent biracial. Mr. Obama descended from Kansans and Kenyans and grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. Mr. Zimmerman has a Peruvian mother, an &quot;Afro-Peruvian&quot; great-grandfather and an old Myspace account that once disparaged Mexicans. Everything about race and ethnicity -- identity, integration, prejudice, conflict -- is getting more complicated. Don't oversimplify the topic or the individuals involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They' don't all think alike</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't speak loosely for or about &quot;white people&quot; or &quot;the black community.&quot; Charles Blow, Charles Ogletree and Charles Barkley see things differently. So do Cornel West, Allen West and Kanye West. These differences don't weaken black America any more than the differences between Joe Biden and Joe the Plumber weaken white America. It's diversity. Deal with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put things in perspective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slavery, segregation, cultural dysfunction and economic stratification are, to put it mildly, a difficult legacy to transcend. It's easier to say &quot;get over it&quot; when you're not the one being followed through the store. But don't forget how far we've come, either. Laws and culture have changed. Disparate treatment persists, but it's less racially motivated and more mediated by class. Forty-three percent of whites voted for our first black president. We have an attorney general who knows what it's like to be profiled. &quot;Things are getting better,&quot; says the president. He's right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Build trust</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can stand there all day defending drug laws, racial profiling and a jury with no black members. But if millions of black Americans vehemently disagree, that's not just their problem. It's your problem. A healthy society requires broad public confidence in its institutions. When people march in the streets because they don't trust the criminal justice system or the voting process, their confidence must be earned. These are your countrymen. They need answers, reform and hope.</SPAN></P>

Black Americans are far less likely to be adjudicated as justified in using deadly force in a firearm-related death. John Roman of the Urban Institute compiled the following figures from the Supplemental Homicide Reports submitted by local law enforcement to the FBI between 2005 to 2010. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He grew up in the mostly white suburban landscape of Morris County, N.J. His mother would tell him &quot;OK, we are one of the only black families in a white neighborhood. You need to behave yourself.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She would also tell him when he was out with his friends -- who were all white -- not to do anything foolish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'They may do it, but the first person the police will look at is you,'&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a grown man now, but still carries the burden of self-consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent events, including the Trayvon Martin trial, have exposed a great divide in this country's race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's just as true here in the Poconos, I discovered based on your reactions to last week's column on the topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This community was transformed by migration from New York and other parts of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monroe County's population changed dramatically over the past decade, and now has the third-highest percentage of minorities among all 67 counties in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black and Hispanic population more than doubled here while the overall population only grew by 22 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a lot of assimilation in a small community, with the potential to create some rifts among different groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bigotry comes in all shapes and sizes: racism, anti-Semitism, fascism, national, cultural and ethnic supremacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some believe it's an uninformed viewpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others argue, sometimes convincingly, it's time to put political correctness aside and face reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What kinds of discrimination do you experience here? What's it like to live as a black person in the Poconos? Or as a Hispanic or white person?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all see the world through the lenses of our upbringings and experiences. Those events can distort our vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is, do we try to correct that vision? Or do we continue to filter reality through our own tinted glasses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not a rhetorical question. We really want to know what you think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pocono Record will host a private roundtable conversation about the issue of race in the Poconos. For 90 minutes, we'll get together at our Stroudsburg office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Shawver signed up to co-edit the award-winning movie &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; which opened nationwide Friday, because he had worked with director Ryan Coogler while they were both graduate students at the University of Southern California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said yes before reading the script because I felt very comfortable working with Ryan,&quot; said the North Providence native by phone from Los Angeles where he is working on another movie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then I read it and was blown away,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is based on the true story of Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old black man who was shot and killed on Dec. 31, 2008, at the Fruitvale subway station in Oakland, Calif., by a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer. Grant was unarmed when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Described as &quot;outstanding&quot; by The Los Angeles Times, and &quot;both sorrowful and suspenseful&quot; by the Fort Worth Star Telegram, &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award for U.S. dramatic film at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where it debuted in January and was picked up by The Weinstein Co. It also won the award for Best First Film in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival in France in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's general release comes amid the national debate generated by the July 13 acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting and killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 18-year-old black man in Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The similiarities are pretty obvious,&quot; said Shawver, adding he had found the not guilty verdict &quot;really, really tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On an emotional level, I was very, very upset by it,&quot; he said, adding that the driving force behind &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; was to show &quot;the human being behind the statistic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; is 27-year-old Coogler's first feature-length film. &quot;It was a very, very low budget movie,&quot; said Shawver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he and his co-editor Claudia Castello worked out of an apartment so small that he slept in a closet. &quot;Nobody was working for the money,&quot; he said. &quot;We all felt it was an important story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For three months we edited like mad people,&quot; he said citing &quot;seven days a week, 12-, 14-hour days to make the deadline for Sundance. We were editing up until five days before the deadline. It was a very tense, tough time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shawver, 29, grew up in North Providence and said he always knew he would be involved in movies. He said he remembers his father picking up &quot;Star Wars&quot; videos and how he became entranced by &quot;the story&quot; and by being &quot;transported to a different world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always had a passion for images and fell in love with that,&quot; he said, adding that whenever I had a school report I asked to do a video. He said when he discovered he could edit movies on a computer, &quot;I would go around and record anything and everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 2006 with a degree in communications and film media, worked odd jobs for a couple of years before heading west and enrolling in the famed film program at USC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shawver said &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; had &quot;zero buzz going into Sundance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once it premiered, people started talking,&quot; he said. &quot;I heard it more and more. It made working in a small room for months and months worth it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that he remembered hearing people cry during the first screening and how he was moved by &quot;having something I did affect people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 28--Despite a call from President Barack Obama and protests in major U.S. cities, there seems to be little interest in revisiting, let alone repealing, Pennsylvania's version of the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand your ground legislation differs from standard self-defense laws because it deals with people protecting themselves, or standing their ground, in a public place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Gov. Tom Corbett signed into law the state Castle Doctrine amendment to the self-defense law in 2011, Pennsylvanians had a duty to flee an attacker and could use deadly force only if they were trapped and had no other option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pennsylvania's law differs from Florida's law in that it requires that an attacker have a firearm or other weapon that could be used to kill. Florida's does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases of George Zimmerman fatally shooting unarmed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford, Fla., or the local bicyclist who defended himself against three unarmed teenagers on the Thun Trail, fatally shooting one, were not stand your ground cases, said Berks County District Attorney John T. Adams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adams said he was frustrated by media accounts and a general public perception that led to attacks on stand your ground laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were self-defense cases,&quot; Adams said. &quot;I see no need to amend our law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading Police Chief William M. Heim said he opposed the state Castle Doctrine when it was first proposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was against Pennsylvania passing such legislation because I don't feel it's needed,&quot; Heim said. &quot;We already have self-defense in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the stand your ground law does is kind of muddy the water as to what can be claimed for self-defense in a public place and can allow criminals to skirt the law by calling on that kind of defense,&quot; Heim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislators split</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years after Corbett signed the Castle Doctrine into law, state legislators remain polarized on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Thomas R. Caltagirone, a Reading Democrat and minority chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that when he was a young legislator he also served on the city's town watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the 1980s and for about a decade Caltagirone patrolled the neighborhoods around his Franklin Street home from about 7 to 10 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We never got out of the car, never confronted anybody,&quot; he said. &quot;We used common sense, and we never challenged anybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, that experience influences his opinion of Pennsylvania's current law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caltagirone believes stand your ground laws encourage violent confrontations that might otherwise be avoided by residents and handled by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think stand your ground goes a little too far,&quot; he said. &quot;Why antagonize or bring on a situation when you could avoid it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the aisle, state Rep. Mark Gillen, a Robeson Township Republican, said the stand your ground language in Pennsylvania's version on the law addresses the fact that people can't always flee an attacker in a public place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I try to personalize things if I can,&quot; Gillen said. &quot;My wife and I have five children, one who is 2 months old, who have to be carried or shepherded around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my mind there are clearly situations where retreat is not an option.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal views</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading defense attorneys Jim Polyak and Allan L. Sodomsky, both with long experience in state and federal courts, had different takes on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a proponent of the justification defense,&quot; Polyak said. &quot;Clearly, if the incident had happened here with the same set of facts, George Zimmerman would have been convicted. In Pennsylvania the other person has to be in possession of a firearm or dangerous weapon. You come up short in that (Trayvon) Martin didn't have a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our law is stricter. It's an added safeguard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sodomsky said he believes the state's old self-defense statute was enough to protect victims of assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 28--The rallies that rippled through the country last weekend spread to Reading on Saturday as people marched down Washington Street from City Park to celebrate Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life and to draw attention to violence in the community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diana Rivera O'Bryant of Reading organized the march because she knows the grief Martin's family is feeling. In 2005, her son Jamar O'Bryant, 26, was fatally shot in the back nine times by rival drug dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a mother who has suffered,&quot; Rivera O'Bryant said. &quot;I can't even explain the pain a mother deals with when she loses a child. What quality of life can our children have if they are growing up in a violent environment?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally focused on &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws debated following the February 2012 fatal shooting of 17-year-old Martin of Sanford, Fla., but also highlighted other civil rights issues, including racial profiling and the Supreme Court decision to strike down a key portion of the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks after a jury acquitted George Zimmerman of second-degree murder in Martin's death, Devonne Lindsey, 41, of Reading was still infuriated. The customer service specialist marched in a black T-shirt that had a white silhouette of Martin's face peeking out of a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am looking for justice, and justice was not served for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Lindsey said. &quot;The stand your ground laws did not protect him at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She carried a sign with words President Obama offered after the not guilty verdict: &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's true,&quot; she said. &quot;A black man living in society today is judged by the color of his skin, not the contents of his character. I have a 23-year-old son and it could have been him, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march concluded at the Penn Street Bridge, where people linked hands to form a human chain and chanted words from &quot;We Shall Overcome.&quot; Then, 17 white balloons were launched into the sky, one for each year of Martin's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the 80-degree heat, Victor Perez Jr., 49, of Reading wore a black hoodie and carried Arizona iced tea to resemble Martin the day he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perez said injustice must also be fought locally. About seven years ago, he said, his daughter was caught in crossfire when leaving a nightclub. She was shot in the back and paralyzed from the waist down, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is beautiful to see the youth here today,&quot; Perez said. &quot;We all need to get along and work together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julia Zion, 33, of Kutztown, a transgender woman, marched because she sees herself in Martin, too. To protect all minorities, Zion said the stand your ground law must be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a trans-woman, I'm scared that someone can come up to me, shoot me, and also get away with it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend's debut of Woody Allen's &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; is one of the veteran writer-director's best ever, and easily the year's strongest specialty box office opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comedy, starring Cate Blanchett and Alec Baldwin, took in $612,726 from just six theaters for distributor Sony Pictures Classics. That's a spectacular $102,128 per-screen average, topping the $87,667 average that &quot;Spring Breakers&quot; managed on three screens in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; debut tops that of &quot;Midnight in Paris,&quot; Allen's 2011 hit that went on to take in $151 million globally. That film opened to a $99,834 average, also from six theaters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Paris&quot; received four Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Allen won for Original Screenplay; the success of &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; is sure to set off awards buzz for the movie and Blanchett in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis C.K., Bobby Cannavale, Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg co-star in the PG-13-rated tale of a woman facing a life crisis, who heads to San Francisco and reconnects with her sister (Sally Hawkins).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only five other movies have debuted with per-screen averages of more than $100,000: &quot;Dreamgirls,&quot; &quot;The Master,&quot; &quot;Moonrise Kingdom,&quot; &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; and &quot;Precious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two movies that expanded this weekend   the Weinstein Company's &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; and Fox Searchlight's &quot;The Way, Way Back&quot;  both connected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale&quot; went from 34 to 1,064 theaters in its third weekend, and cracked the national top ten with $4.6 million, an average of $4,377 per location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First-time director Ryan Coogler's drama is about the last day in the life of 22-year-old Oscar Grant, who was fatally shot by a guard after an altercation on a BART train in Oakland, Calif., on New Year's Day, 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film, which stars Michael B. Jordan, Melonie Diaz and Octavia Spencer, is clearly tapping into the national discussion surrounding the recent verdict in Trayvon Martin murder case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard not link them, and we're getting more mention than we otherwise would have because the media is making that connection,&quot; said Weinstein's head of distribution Erik Lomis. &quot;But this is a movie that deserves to be seen, and we're glad diverse audiences are discovering it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Way Way Back&quot; went from 304 theaters to 886 and brought in $3.3 million, a $3,725 per-screen average for the coming-of-age comedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Carell, Tony Collette and Liam James star in the film, written and directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. It's taken in more than $8.9 million since opening on July 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBS Films opened its Aubrey Plaza comedy &quot;The To-Do List,&quot; written and directed by Maggie Carey, in 591 theaters and it brought in $1.5 million   roughly its production budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the movie Plaza was promoting when she crashed Will Ferrell's presentation at the MTV Movie Awards in April, with the movie's title written on her chest. (For the record, CBS says the stunt was all her idea.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young women were the target demographic for the R-rated film, and audiences broke down 60 percent female, but 58 percent over 25. The story follows high school girl Brandy Clark (Plaza) who, feeling pressured to become more experienced before she goes to college, makes a list of sexual achievements to accomplish before heading off to college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Hader, Alia Shawkat, Rachel Bilson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Adam Samberg co-star in the film, which has a 72 percent positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The primary election ballots are out now, and I'll bet many voters won't know who to vote for. There are only six offices in Spokane County with three or more candidates running for a senate, city council or a school board position. Many voters might think &quot;Why bother?&quot; Answer: Because the primary is a critical election. It decides who will be on the November ballot. Hopefully, the two most qualified people will move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a member of &quot;We Believe - We Vote,&quot; I was privileged to join a team of 18 average conservative citizens to interview all of the willing candidates for contested offices. We have posted our preferences and why we recommend one or two candidates over the others at www.WeBelieveWeVote.com. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm happy that another reader was upset by The Spokesman-Review's July 13 coverage of the $25 million dollar bequest to Gonzaga University. The man's gift of money was relegated to &quot;News in brief,&quot; while his legal problems made front-page news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I guess that says it all about which is more important to the paper. Rather uncharitable of you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE TRIED SHRINERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My name is Brooke Davis, and I am the mother of Jameson Davis. Kaitlin Gillespie wrote an article about our story on July 14. I came across a comment made by Carole Folsom of Cheney in the July 21 (newspaper) about Kaitlin's article and wanted to let you know that her opinion is incorrect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We did not overlook Spokane Shriners Hospital. In fact, that was the very first place we sought help and any information for Jameson's prosthesis. Our consultation was with Dr. Paul Casky. He informed my husband, Jim, and I that they could not treat Jameson due to the fact that they lack a prosthetics department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have had many people suggest Shriners here in Spokane, and we appreciate it, but the fact of the matter is that they do not have the &quot;state-of-the-art procedure&quot; that would benefit our son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My husband and I wish for the correct information to be told and let it be known that we have been to Shriners and they just do not have the facility to help us here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spokane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LET US SPEAK FOR OURSELVES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I couldn't help but be perplexed and somewhat amused by Paul Carpenter's use of the pronoun &quot;our&quot; in his July 21 letter to the editor. Carpenter, who is a Colville resident, was venting his concerns about the Spokane City Council's proposed changes to gun-buying ordinances within the city itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last time I drove to Colville, it was 74 miles away and not even in the same county. I can only assume that the &quot;our&quot; reference to Second Amendment rights and tax money is toward those of us who actually live inside the Spokane city limits, who can vote on local leadership or social and political issues and pay taxes on our property, utilities and retail purchases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, Carpenter does have a right to weigh in on just about anything he chooses. This is America. However, he should speak for himself as a Colville resident and don't presume to be a spokesperson for &quot;our&quot; concerns as actual taxpaying residents of Spokane.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CATHY'S KIT DISHONEST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The July 24 article on Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers' &quot;planning kit&quot; for Republican House members to use during the August recess should be cause for alarm. I assume she follows her own advice to other Republican House members and will make sure that all participants and attendees to her Obamacare tour meetings in the 5th Congressional District will be adamantly &quot;on message&quot; that Obamacare needs to be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This way, McMorris Rodgers can then &quot;honestly&quot; tell her constituents and fellow House members that Eastern Washington is 100 percent against Obamacare, and in favor of repeal, because she will have talked with people throughout the district and received such message loud and clear during the August recess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I would expect such shenanigans from former Louisiana Gov. Huey Long, but not from our 5th District representative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CANDIDACY EMBARRASSING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I read the article about state Sen. John Smith, 7th District, and I was shocked. In the July 14 article, Smith admits to getting married in a white supremacy church, and he also admits to having white supremacy relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is no room in today's America for politicians with white supremacy ties. And I can't understand how the Republican Party, or any other party for that matter, could support or endorse a politician associated with hate groups. This is absolutely embarrassing to the Republican Party, the Senate seat once occupied by Bob Morton and to Eastern Washington.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An arrest was made, a trial completed, followed by a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. Now, those same radical people are still ranting &quot;Justice for Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Justice was served. It makes me sick that this is still going on, and making it a racially charged topic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Butler&quot; saga, continued: The Weinstein Co. film, scheduled to open Aug. 16, must amend its title to &quot;Lee Daniels' The Butler,&quot; with the director's name at 75 percent the size of the title. The studio also must pay $400,000 to the MPAA, with a $50,000 fine per day until compliance is complete. In what Harvey Weinstein might term better news, its Sundance winner &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; now in release, has attained new relevance because of its resonance with the Trayvon Martin case. Of course, Harvey is too classy to play up that angle, but he's not above reviewers doing it for him. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was cleared after shooting dead unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in February 2012. Protesters angry with the verdict have spent nearly two weeks at the Capitol building. Belafonte said Scott still has a chance to act before the protests intensify.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEARING down the highway to New York City, we take a turn off looking for a cheap motel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, we find ourselves driving along North Street, Greenwich, one of the wealthiest streets in the wealthiest town in the wealthiest country in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are definitely no rooms for rent in these mega mansions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you've got a cool $US10 million ($A10.79 million) you can secure an entry-level home in the region with six bedrooms and seven bathrooms set on 5ha. Sure, the Aussie dollar is good, but it's not that good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Greenwich, in the state of Connecticut, about half an hour's drive north of New York and home to America's finance overlords, it's old wealth and its richest celebrities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the American dream. On steroids. Frankly, it's obscene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of things I've always admired about Americans is their ability to dream big. Their spirit of optimism, confidence and entrepreneurship is unique in the world. And it couldn't be any further from our Aussie spirit, which tears down tall poppies and generally takes harshly to anyone seen to big-note themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans dream big. And they fall hard. The US economy has been in, or at the edge of, recession since its housing and credit boom imploded in 2008 causing the global financial crisis. American families have watched their real incomes go backwards. Unemployment remains near 8 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While on holiday there, we heard the news that the mayor of Detroit has declared that city bankrupt, its debts so high they will never be repaid. The population of Detroit has shrunk by a quarter since the car industry began to close its doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by far the biggest news story in America while we are there was of the trial and acquittal of a man charged of racially profiling and shooting dead a young black man, Trayvon Martin, in Florida. We watch on TV as President Obama gives a heartfelt press conference calling for calm, while sorrowfully admitting, as a black man, it could just have easily been him a few decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another US president, in another time, declared ``all men are created equal''. In principle, that's true. In practice, the US has a long way to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveys of income mobility reveal that for all the rhetoric of being a ``land of opportunity'', America's poor have less chance of becoming rich than Australia's poor do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The great mythology of America, of rags to riches, is statistically more likely to happen here. Australia: the land of the free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2007 study by economist and federal Labor MP Andrew Leigh found the income of Australian sons are less determined by their father's pay packet than American sons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is Australia home to less extremes of wealth and poverty, it is also easier for Australians to move between the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia has managed to achieve this despite our high influx of migration. In America, about one in 10 citizens were born overseas. In Australia, it's one in four. We have managed to absorb great waves of immigrants and come out the stronger for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's harder to look at a person in the street in Australia and know, just by their ethnicity or the colour of their skin, how rich they are. According to the study by Leigh, it is this difference in the income mobility of immigrants in Australia that makes us so much more mobile than Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, we've got our own obscenely rich people too. But there are fewer of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's just how I like it. I'm proud to live in a country where the circumstances of your birth are less likely to determine the circumstances of your life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're not perfect in Australia but I wouldn't want to live anywhere else in the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no sidewalks here. Only beech tree lined streets with neatly trimmed verges, thick-stone walling and automatic gates.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have a cool $US10 million you can secure an entry-level home in the region with six bedrooms and seven bathrooms set on 12 acres. One such property currently on the market promises an ``Enthralling two-storey entrance foyer, with inlaid limestone and wood flooring with sweeping circular staircase. Ballroom-sized sunken living room with beautiful coffered ceiling, limestone fireplace and French doors to the veranda.'' Sure, the Aussie dollar is good, but it's not THAT good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Greenwich, in the state of Connecticut, about half an hour's drive to the north of New York and home to America's finance overlords -- it is old wealth and it is richest celebrities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a place abundant in French doors, sweeping driveways, marble fireplaces, 3000-bottle wine cellars, front doors framed by stone colonnades, mahogany-panelled libraries with antique hemlock wood floors and dangling chandeliers. These houses have elevators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2010, Aussie actor Mel Gibson sold his 75-acre, Tudor-style Greenwich home `The Mill', which he shared with his wife Robyn, for $24 million. It was listed again last year for $33 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George III's defeat was celebrated again on Independence Day earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were fireworks popping all over American media as they joined the British with saturation coverage of Kate's labour, &quot;easel watch&quot; and princely name fever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hilarious watching American media pundits ask - themselves why they cared so much - for hours on end. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet nothing else was on TV. On Fox, one talking head &quot;suggested they name the child &quot;HRH Prince Barack Obama of Cambridge&quot; because the president wanted &quot;a monarchy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Didn't George Washington lay it down?&quot; he spluttered, enraged at the fact the media storm continued, while little George, right, lay quietly unconcerned in his cot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do we look up to Kate Middleton?&quot; he demanded. &quot;What did she do except be attractive and meet the prince?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I heard The King's Speech and &quot; Princess Diana cited again and again. The Yanks were also keen to comment on our national culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're all celebrating in the pub,&quot; said one TV anchor. &quot;Well Brian, at this time of night Brits are in the pub anyway,&quot; replied his correspondent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was clear that the British monarchy really is the only one that counts across the Pond - proving again the huge value of the Crown to our tourism industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince George was 8lb 6oz of baby and billions of dollars worth of free advertising for Visit Britain. Celebrated Left-wing pundit Chris Matthews explained it in terms of the special relationship, pointing out that we Brits are the only ones who &quot;really fight with the Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the chips are down, GI Joe and Tommy fight together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a special relationship - and now we have a new baby in the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awww. Kind of sweet, isn't it? If it was satisfying to see the US networks slavishly bending the knee to our smallest prince, it was even better to see him upstaging the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As ever, Barack was as slow as he could be in paying a royal tribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Twitter account was putting out standard political fare as the birth was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, a standard tweet of congratulations was sent WITHOUT the initials &quot;B.O.&quot; - always appended when the president writes something himself, meaning that he left this one to staffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House message came after many others from world leaders too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But our nappy-clad royal was able to strike back with a rather effective snub of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's major economic address - a Left-wing spectacular on income inequality - was interrupted in the middle by the network announcements of the royal moniker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The po-faced president - who is rumoured to have a strong personal dislike of Great Britain - was swept from the air by Kate's bundle of joy, to instant mockery from Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sorry President Obama, Imma let you finish, but this baby's name is GEORGE!&quot; crowed one, giving it the Kanye West-Taylor Swift treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Must suck when your speech on income inequality is overshadowed by a baby that was literally born with limitless wealth and privilege,&quot; chuckled @sambaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Obama hates Britain&quot; idea has a lot of traction over here in the US - with many suggesting the timing was deliberate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, this is the man who thought it appropriate to give Gordon Brown a stack of wrong-region DVDs as a state gift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Westminster is trolling @BarackObama?&quot; suggested @ThePantau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Payback for the iPod and the Churchill bust,&quot; laughed another tweeter, referring to the time Obama presented our 80-year-old Queen with that very gadget - and removed the statue of former PM Winston from the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Royal infant interrupts infantile &quot;Aeader,&quot; was a popular line, as was &quot;Always Presidenting in the shadow of a George&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The little prince's shared name with George Zimmerman - acquitted of the killing of Trayvon - Martin - didn't go unnoticed either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Prezzy got interrupted by a little George guy,&quot; said a commenter on one blog. &quot;Must be that karma thingy.&quot; Indeed, it was surely no comfort to Obama to read his latest approval figures - the lowest since after his first presidential debate disaster against Mitt Romney last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That other George, Zimmerman, has also dented Obama's public standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His speech on race went down poorly with many Americans, who agreed with my column last week that the president should respect the jury's &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict and butt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, for Obama this week has been a royal pain in the ass.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene Robinson (July 19) has no desire to &quot;talk honestly about unresolved racial issues,'' because if he did he would address, in addition to slavery, Jim Crow and white racism the following issues:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Young black men perpetrate violent crimes, including murder, at a rate far above their numerical representation in the population. According to the Bureau of Justice, black victims were killed by blacks 94 percent of the time during 1976 to 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Black men and women far too often choose to have children without marrying. According to NBC News, 72 percent of black children are born to unwed mothers. This number was lower several decades back, when racism and oppression of blacks were worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Too much of black popular culture (e.g. hip-hop) glorifies threatening behavior and dress, as well as thuggery, promiscuity and violence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am aware that many in the black community abhor these behaviors and trends, and some are working hard to improve matters, including several hip-hop artists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, whenever I see some yahoo driving around with a Confederate flag on his car (excuse me, moron, it was about slavery!), I am reminded that racist troglodytes persist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, you can't have an honest discussion about any social issue without gross generalizations with lots of exceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson is correct, our president contributes enormously by just being who he is, a model family man. Honestly, race relations will improve when substantially more young black men and women follow the president's and first lady's model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Brooks, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason that the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial feels different to everyone is because it is different. It is based on the new laws that were passed to make the &quot;stand your ground'' law work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those laws included a greatly expanded definition of self-defense that basically allows a person to shoot anyone that scares them, as well as greatly expanded concealed-weapon laws that allow anyone to carry a concealed weapon anywhere they wish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two expansions make the &quot;stand your ground'' law possible and are responsible for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's legal killing. And until this entire set of laws is repealed in Florida and the other states that adopted them, we will continue to see tragedies like this play out all across America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judy Ginter, Pequea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict allows George Zimmerman to go on with his life, fractured as it might become once his identity morphs into a viral commodity. His relief will no doubt be quelled in the days ahead by people who have no right to impeach his existence but who will do so anyway. That's life in our technology age; we have a vast supply ready to sate the heartless demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much was made of the news agencies framing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as an angelic 12-year-old. The argument was made that the media was introducing a racial element where none existed by airing grade-school pictures instead of those showing a taller, stronger Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, that &quot;hulking,&quot; &quot;thuggish&quot; version of Trayvon that was posited for counter-purposes was equally erroneous. As author Tim Wise pointed out on CNN, the reports of a 6-foot-2 Trayvon&nbsp;Martin stretched the truth of his height by almost half a foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Race mattered in this trial, the same way race matters in our everyday lives. Too much, and for all the wrong reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peaceful protests that have sprouted up in cities across the country shouldn't be dismissed; they should be welcomed. You know the conversations we're always talking about starting? Well, here's one being started for us. Here's our chance. If we can't come together to mourn the loss of a young man taken too soon and to seek solutions to the problems, then all is lost. Not simply for African-Americans, but for each and every one of us. Society deserves better than that and we should expect better of ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Anthony Hondares, East Lampeter Township</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as I'm aware, the New York subway police are still assisted in patrols by the Guardian Angels, a civilian group identified by their red berets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If neighborhood watch volunteers wore an identifying garment such as a light-colored windbreaker or hat with &quot;neighborhood watch'' prominently displayed on it, maybe tragedies such as occurred in Florida could be averted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, George Zimmerman should have identified himself as a neighborhood watch and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin should have replied that, while not a local resident, he was visiting his father at a nearby address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many young males have a tendency to use physical aggression first and ask questions later. Similar young male behavior can be seen in schools. Often misidentified as &quot;bullying,'' it is really just young males sorting out their pecking order, which will continue in one form or another throughout most of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such behavior can also be observed in the service. for example, if some sailors are in a bar and a group of Marines or soldiers enter, you can bet there will be a rumble. It's not that the servicemen hate each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real challenge for any young male is to not let a verbal confrontation or fistfight escalate into serious physical harm or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Gerasim, East Lampeter Township</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent demands of commissioner Scott Martin requesting each county department refund monies spent fighting unions is the height of foolish self-positioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general public knows that he and many other Republicans are anti-union. What they seldom think about is, what is a union? It is an agreement that binds two or more people together because of a common bond or mutual interest, such as the Republican Party and corporations or Democrats and the rights of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parties have chosen extreme positions and both are crippling the business of the people. They are continuing to waste taxpayer monies in any way possible for their own benefit, such as robbing the state pension fund without paying into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The core of county workers are the backbone of our local government. They need protection from the greed of the political parties who hand county jobs to their union friends who are often paid more and given line offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Martin, good management respects its workforce and balances the best interests of the public. Look what your union is doing in this state and the nation. Leadership demands some common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William R. Hazlett, Warwick Township</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 40 years ago Congress set up the Community Development Block Grant program to return federal tax money to communities around the country for local investment. From what I have seen, it has been a good program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican House wants to cut this $3 billion program to $1.6 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lancaster County currently receives $2.62 million and Lancaster city $1.4 million. This program has already been reduced by 25 percent since 2010. To cut it further is unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hate to see long-standing programs that addressed community needs be undressed by a Republican House that seems to have little compassion for the people they were elected to serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our representative, Joe Pitts, is wrong on this issue. I urge you to call him and tell him so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas R. Hassler, Lancaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We appreciated Steve Cornell's column (July 14) so much. It presented a level-headed look at the subject without getting in anyone's &quot;face.&quot; Steve was not pushy on the moral issues but presented them as they are and should be looked at by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we are open to others' opinions, there are some things that are not to be changed. Many are loudly demanding their view be accepted, when their view does not measure to the standards God himself has instituted from the beginning of mankind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe God has the best plan for all mankind. There would be less conflict at hurt and violence if his plans were followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not much of a person to have the right words to say - but Steve said it well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don and Kay Kurtz, Ephrata</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't touch my pension&quot; has been the ongoing theme of our elected officials. C. Beyl's cartoon (July 21) &quot;Pension Ice Cream&quot; and Eric Epstein's &quot;In My Opinion - Rep. Pitts enjoys bountiful harvest&quot; (July 21) are both right on target concerning the problem of unrealistic pension programs that will continue to burden today's taxpayers and the taxpayers of generations to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time has come for these programs to be adjusted. These politicians need to be including their pension plans and free lifetime health care insurance coverage on the cutting table with the other programs that they so freely cut and squeeze, such as education, public libraries, Medicare and Medicaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Winters, Marietta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in reference to the excellent &quot;In My Opinion&quot; article in the July 21 Perspective section. I endorse the comments of Eric Epstein. This is another illustration of a politician who does not know when to retire and is definitely overpaid with his annual income plus lifetime benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also demonstrates why terms of office should be limited to reduce the outrageous pensions of members of Congress. Let us tell it like it is: &quot;Joe Pitts is the pits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarence W. Martin, Lititz</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviewed this week:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**Le Show**KCSN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**The Last Word**Today FM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**Le Show**(KCSN), the long-running brainchild of US actor and impressionist Harry Shearer, is a difficult programme to review. Much like Seinfeld, which tapped into a similarly sardonic strain of American humour, it's not really about anything in particular. Tune into it at any random moment and it'll take you a while to settle into its stop-start groove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hugely talented Shearer has enjoyed a lucrative career. He voices Mr Burns, Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner, Kent Brockman and dozens of others on The Simpsons, for which he gets paid $300,000 per episode. He also played walrus-faced bass player Derek Smalls (&quot;I've taken acid 75, no, 76 times . . . so I've had my moments in the sky&quot;) in This Is Spinal Tap, and was a leading light in the glory days of Saturday Night Live. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Show is his weekly personal playpen. A tapas menu in radio form, it hops from comedy sketches to news items, niche slots, meandering monologues and snippets of music (usually jazz). It typifies the in-out-shake-it-all-about format favoured by, among others, Danny Baker when he was running amok at the BBC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend's Le Show was recorded not in Shearer's home of LA, but in Britain, and there was a distinct environmentalist tint to the programme. His news monologue covered Barclays Bank's manipulation of electric power prices in California; Britain's ongoing wayward weather (this was two days before huge downpours flooded large tracts of the country); the threat of drought in the US due to water shortages; and the logistical nightmares of Afghanistan's reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I got the feeling that this was a starchier and worthier than usual edition of Le Show. But the dagger of derision was unsheathed numerous times. There was a withering riff on Rupert Murdoch's inability to shake off the phone-hacking scandal (&quot;NiceCorp&quot; drawled Shearer, &quot;nice people doing nice things&quot;), and an acerbic comparison of Ed Snowden's situation to that of Robert Seldon Lady, a rogue CIA operative just returned to the US. Shearer squeezed the maximum comedic mileage out of the man's name without poking fun at it outright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shearer's speaking voice is essentially an unexaggerated Kent Brockman, and he also likes to drop in long, hanging pauses for effect, as Kent does -- making you feel as if you're watching a Simpsons news bulletin, which may or may not be the desired effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Show ran for nearly three decades on Californian station KCRW, which last April made it webcast-only, much to Shearer's annoyance. He now signs off each week by harrumphing that the programme has been brought to us &quot;by the Change Is Hard Radio Network&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain parts of Le Show tend to drag, and chopping off 10 or 15 minutes would do a lot for its focus. But when it's good, it's extremely good. You can listen to it at kcsn.org/programs/le-show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is it with our drivetime shows and their inexplicable fondness for US conservatives? The Right Hook has Michael Graham, of whom no more need be said, while **The Last Word**(Today FM) gives Cal Thomas a prime slot once a week. Do these lads come with a tax break or something?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas is less preposterous than Graham, which is like saying parsnips are better than turnips. A Bill O'Reillyesque figure in his 60s, he's a regular presence on Fox News and writes books with titles like The Death Of Ethics In America. He was initially restrained last Tuesday when analysing the bankruptcy of Detroit, content to recommend a strong dose of Chicago School of Economics elixir to save the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk then turned to the Trayvon Martin case. Here, normal service was dispiritingly and wearyingly resumed, with Thomas accusing &quot;so-called civil rights leaders&quot; of &quot;stirring the pot&quot; and &quot;keeping [Americans] racially divided&quot;. If The Last Word and its Newstalk rival can't find more clued-up voices than these to commentate on America, they're not trying hard enough.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMPA  - While the country raged about the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case, it seemed no one was paying attention to what was happening in Chicago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the same weekend jurors delivered their verdict in Orlando, five people were killed and 16 were wounded - most of them in their 20s - in a part of the city that is becoming synonymous with violence. Marchers' pleas for peace on Chicago's South Side, led by a local priest and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, went unheeded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I grew up north of Detroit, another city torn apart by racial unrest, gang shootings and drug deals gone bad. I will never forget the riots in the summer of '67. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The noise is louder now, with cable TV commentators and Facebook commenters assigning blame and dredging up old biases. Everyone has an answer, but nothing really changes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me introduce you to Keith Babb III, who doesn't waste his time pointing fingers. He is determined to be a change agent in Tampa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the perks of my job is that I get to meet ordinary people in our community doing extraordinary things. Keith, 29, certainly fits that description. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He's doing his part in reversing what is so destructive in our society. Even if it's just a small step, it's in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">right direction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keith could have gone in the wrong direction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raised in Pahokee, a poor rural community outside of West Palm Beach, he started running with the wrong crowd after his father dropped out of his life. He did stupid things, including vandalizing a cop car when he was 13. Even getting a football scholarship to Nebraska didn't help. After his first semester, his girlfriend called and said she was pregnant. Determined not to be an absent father, he dropped out of school and came back to Florida to work a menial job to support the baby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three years later, a paternity test determined the child wasn't his. He directed his anger at all women, sleeping around and evolving into a not so nice guy, as he describes it. He decided to return to school and came to Tampa to attend the University of South Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Life turned around for Keith. He rediscovered the Christian faith instilled in him as a child by his grandmother. Then he met Sarina at a Wendy's in 2006, and married her two years later. He got his bachelor's in social work and a master's degree in public administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keith has that inner something so necessary to tackle what seems to be an impossible task. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By day, Keith earns a paycheck working as the teen outreach program coordinator for the Wyman Center. But it's what he does on weekends that deserves the most kudos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He's the founder and director of 2nd C.H.A.N.C.E. Center 4 Boyz, a nonprofit faith-based juvenile delinquency and diversion program for at-risk kids. He and his fellow volunteers work  with youth sent to them by the court or concerned educators, providing mentoring, character development, community service and extracurricular activities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They lead roundtable discussions on mistakes they made in their own lives and how to make better choices. They teach the importance of good manners and setting goals. They organize competitive games that demonstrate good sportsmanship. They have pizza parties, visit college campuses so the boys can envision a future there and they participate in clean-up initiatives in the neighborhood. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most important, the adults listen and give feedback. Some of these kids have few, if any, adult males providing that kind of attention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And they do it every Saturday in five-week sessions.  For no pay. This is strictly a volunteer effort. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keith doesn't have a facility, a center, as the name of his organization implies. One day, maybe. For now, we go from pillar to post, he says and laughs. We're always on the move. It's not an ideal situation, but we make do. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What's the motivation? In his day job, Keith deals with youth - and I'm borrowing the language right from Wyman's own description - living in low-resource environments and whose circumstances create risk of lower life opportunities. His goal is to redirect them to lead successful lives and build strong communities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Keith wanted to do more. He wanted to build relationships with troubled kids that went beyond a scripted plan. Something looser, something more casual that would be meaningful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And something that would avoid what is happening in cities like Chicago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So Keith developed 2nd C.H.A.N.C.E. and launched it in 2010 in Sulphur Springs, one of Tampa's most impoverished areas. He found like-minded volunteers - at his church, in the community and at the University of South Florida - whose own lives could serve as a role model for at-risk youth. As the program gained momentum, he made a proposal to his contacts at the juvenile courts. His experience, reputation and passion were in his favor. The powers that be agreed to give it a try. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had one request. Keith wanted to work with teens. But that's not what they had in mind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We needed more help with our younger kids, says Monica Martinez, supervisor of the Juvenile Court Diversion Program. You start early, and maybe they won't end up in the system as teens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She refers kids ages 9 to 12 to Keith's  program because of the early intervention it offers. They're getting positive reinforcement from an adult outside the home, she says. It shows the kids there are people in the community who care about them, who will encourage them to stay in school and make the right decisions. That is so crucial. You can't take that attention for granted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rhonda Ervin of Ybor City is already seeing changes in the behavior of her 11-year-old son, Randall, who just completed a five-week session. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of his teachers at Community Charter School of Excellence recommended that Randall take part in the program - not because he had gotten into trouble with the law or at school, but because he was on the cusp. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had a flip mouth, Rhonda Ervin says. An attitude problem, you know what I mean? She felt he could benefit from some one-on-one attention from an older male with a positive influence. I was willing to try anything, she says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now her son is helping with the dishes. He's opening doors for his mom. He's addressing her as ma'am and not sassing back. He's talking about getting good grades in school so he can eventually go to college. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I asked Randall how the 2nd C.H.A.N.C.E. volunteers are making a difference in his life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They're teaching me how to be a gentleman, he says, looking me directly in the eye. I'm a better person now. I don't want to end up a ghetto kid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There's no telling if these small steps will turn into significant strides. But it's a start. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Aug. 17, Keith and his fellow mentors will host A G.R.O.W.N. Man's School Survival Guide, a day for program participants and their parents. They'll get backpacks and back-to-school supplies to encourage academic success for the coming year and participate in several workshops. The acronym stands for principles dear to Keith's own heart: Grounded in values, redefined by your inside, owning your actions, willing to be selfless and navigated by your purpose. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the long term, he's directing his passion into creating a 5,000-square-foot permanent home for the program. He needs supporters and benefactors to share his vision of changing lives before hatred and anger take root. Before the kids end up in prison or, worse, dead. From his own experience, Keith knows it is possible to turn things around. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I've had my second chance. And every day, I thank God for it, he says. So now it's my purpose to do for others. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama is talking about it, and so is the attorney general. There are marches in Florida and across the country, and protesters have been camped inside the state Capitol for more than a week. Yet Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature's Republican leaders continue to defend the indefensible &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. That is not a winning strategy for Florida's national image, its economy or the safety of its residents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial two weeks ago sparked more outrage over the 2005 &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which allows the use of lethal force with no duty to retreat if a person reasonably believes his or her life is in danger.While Zimmerman did not seek a pretrial hearing and specifically invoke the law as a defense, the law played a role in his acquittal. The judge referred to the law in open court, the jury instructions included the law's expanded protections for using force without retreating, and the jurors discussed it. Respecting the jury's verdict and appreciating the difficulty of its deliberations should not translate into a stubborn defense of bad law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument for repeal was strong even without the Zimmerman case. The Tampa Bay Times reviewed 200 &quot;stand your ground&quot; cases last year, and in about one-third of those cases the defendant started the fight and went free. The law has freed killers and aggressive attackers, drug dealers and other criminals whose claims of self-defense were questionable. Since Florida enacted the law, some two dozen states have embraced similar laws, and one study has found an 8 percent increase in murders and non-negligent manslaughters in those states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely Florida legislators did not expect these results when they overwhelmingly voted for the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law eight years ago. Some lawmakers who acknowledge the law's flaws fear tackling the issue now because race has become a larger issue since Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, killed Trayvon Martin, who was African-American. But race already was an issue. The Times investigation found that 73 percent of those who killed a black person walked away free, while those who killed a white person went free 59 percent of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor continues to defend the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law despite the overwhelming evidence of its unintended consequences. Scott cites the task force he appointed after Martin's death last year that recommended only minor changes. But the task force was stacked in favor of the law's supporters, and the Legislature failed to make even the few changes that were recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conventional wisdom says the Legislature should never go into special session without having a plan first. But repealing the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law does not require a plan. It requires courage to stand up for Florida, acknowledge the mistake and vote to repeal a bad law that cannot be fixed. The sooner the better.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The law had little opposition when it passed, and most who voted for it still would.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida has become a broad national target for its &quot;stand your ground&quot; law since the July 13 acquittal of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Daily Show mocked Florida as &quot;the worst state.&quot; A protest group entering its third week staging a sit-in outside Gov. Rick Scott's office has gained fans in England and Japan. And the law has sparked a rebuke from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who said it may encourage &quot;violent situations to escalate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the &quot;Gunshine State&quot; finds itself in the cross hairs of world public opinion, the lawmakers who approved &quot;stand your ground&quot; in 2005 have received little, if any, electoral blowback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not been a campaign issue,&quot; said Sen. John Legg, R-Trinity, who voted for it as a representative. &quot;It's not like homeowners insurance or nuclear recovery costs.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current state lawmakers who voted for &quot;stand your ground&quot; outnumber those who opposed it by a 4-1 margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans who approved it are unapologetic. Not one would repeal it now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's never come up on the campaign trail, pro or con,&quot; said former Sen. Victor Crist, R-Tampa, who now serves as a Hillsborough County commissioner. &quot;The firearm abolitionists are stirring the pot, using 'stand your ground' as a platform to eliminate guns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats are far less unified. When SB 436 was signed by then-Gov. Jeb Bush on April 26, 2005, it enjoyed solid bipartisan support. It passed the Senate 39-0, a tally that included 14 Democrats, such as 2014 gubernatorial hopeful Nan Rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I voted based on what I thought was the intent of the law,&quot; Rich said. &quot;Obviously, if I knew then what I know about how the law was implemented, I would not have voted for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Miami, voted for it as a state senator, but in February issued a resolution urging the repeal of &quot;stand your ground.&quot; At a Miami rally following the Zimmerman verdict, Wilson told a crowd: &quot;This legislation is so difficult to even decipher what it means. It applies to some cases, doesn't apply to another case. The Justice Department is confused. The legislators are confused. Everybody's confused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She didn't return messages asking about her earlier support of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 133 lawmakers who voted for the legislation, 48 hold elected office today. A state representative from Miami became U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. Eight others went on to Congress, where five still serve. State Sen. Jeff Atwater is Florida's chief financial officer. State Reps. Jeff Kottkamp and Jennifer Carroll ascended to lieutenant governor. Of the 94 representatives who approved it in the Florida House, 16 graduated to the state Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, some hadn't reconsidered their votes. Sen. Gwen Margolis, D-Aventura, said she had to look up the roll call on the Web to remember how she voted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Trayvon was shot, the first thing I did was check my vote,&quot; Margolis said. &quot;It didn't sound like something I voted for, but when I saw it, I was absolutely amazed. It was just one of those things, where it sounded reasonable, but wasn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Margolis and Rich said the bill breezed through the Senate with minimal discussion partly because of the reputation of its sponsor - Sen. Durell Peaden, R-Crestview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Peaden was a solid, quiet Southern gentleman,&quot; said Margolis, who favors repealing the law now. &quot;There are people you have to worry about doing bad things as lawmakers. He wasn't one of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another reason for the unanimous Senate support was Sen. Al Lawson, D-Tallahassee, one of seven African-American senators to vote for it. Then the minority leader for the Democrats in the Senate, Lawson said Peaden's message of self-defense resonated with him because of a 1996 home invasion in which his wife, Delores Lawson, was bound, gagged and assaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me, it was a self-defense issue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawson said he doesn't favor repealing the law. Like most Republicans, the Democrat said it didn't apply in the Zimmerman case. But he said he's convinced the law should be reviewed following a Tampa Bay Times investigation last year that showed in 200 cases where &quot;stand your ground&quot; was used, nearly 70 percent of those who invoked &quot;stand your ground&quot; to avoid prosecution were successful and defendants were more likely to prevail if the victim is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate in the House was more robust. Twenty Democrats voted against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill's sponsor was Rep. Dennis Baxley, who has been a divisive figure and is a fierce champion of the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reps. Dan Gelber of Miami Beach and Jack Seiler of Fort Lauderdale led the Democratic opposition. Gelber later served in the Senate and ran for attorney general in 2010. Seiler is now mayor of Fort Lauderdale. Both spoke during debate of concerns that the law would lead to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former federal prosecutor, Gelber foresaw how &quot;stand your ground&quot; would become perilous. On the House floor, he presciently imagined a case in which an argument escalates to the point where an armed person fires a weapon in self-defense and, protected by the law, accidentally shoots an innocent bystander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I simply believed it was going to create (legal) defenses that people should not be entitled to,&quot; Gelber says now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seiler envisioned gang members would use the law for immunity, which has played out in a number of cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was so frustrated that it passed in the language that it passed,&quot; Seiler said. &quot;The way the law was written was flawed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some say they still don't understand why Senate Democrats, like Les Miller, who is now a Hillsborough County Commissioner, voted for it en masse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I based my vote on what research there was and the testimony at the time,&quot; said Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, who voted against it as a representative. &quot;It was a very bad bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 12 House Democrats voted for it, including Bob Henriquez, now the Hillsborough County property appraiser, and Charlie Justice, now a Pinellas County commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to look back that many years ago and say we could have foreseen any of this,&quot; said Henriquez, a conservative Democrat. &quot;It didn't have anything to do with the Zimmerman case. Does it have flaws? Yes, and it should be looked at. But I stand by my original vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not like anyone has been asking, though. Henriquez, Crist, Margolis, Legg and Lawson said they hadn't been questioned about the legislation until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one else has asked me questions about it since I voted for it,&quot; Lawson said. &quot;You're the first.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expanding self-defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People have had the right to defend themselves from a threat as far back as English common law. The key in Florida and many other states was that they could not use deadly force if it was reasonably possible to retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That changed in 2005 when Florida Gov. Jeb Bush signed the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. It says a person &quot;has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground'' if he or she thinks deadly force is necessary to prevent death, great bodily harm or commission of a forcible felony like robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law only requires law enforcement and the justice system to ask three questions in self-defense cases: Did the defendant have the right to be there? Was he engaged in a lawful activity? Could he reasonably have been in fear of death or great bodily harm?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without convincing evidence to the contrary, &quot;stand your ground'' protection prevails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If prosecutors press charges, any defendant claiming self-defense is now entitled to a hearing before a judge. At the immunity hearing, a judge must decide based on the &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; whether to grant immunity. That's a far lower burden than &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; the threshold prosecutors must meet at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, the judge said in jury instructions that George Zimmerman not only had no legal duty to retreat, but had the right to stand his ground.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their deep racial divide is in lock step with public opinion polls released during the past week showing that African Americans overwhelmingly disagreed with the verdict, compared with a narrow majority of white Americans who agreed with it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One poll also showed a stark difference of opinion in the role of race in the case, which exploded into the public consciousness last year when Zimmerman, then a 27-year-old armed neighborhood watch volunteer for his gated community, confronted and killed Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old who was walking back to the home of a family friend after a trip to the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges by a jury of six women was accepted by Muth, who is white, and rejected by Henderson, who is black, reflecting a wider racial rift. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the jurors were split in their views of whether justice was served. On Thursday, the lone minority on the panel, a Puerto Rican woman , said in a television interview that Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder,&quot; but based on Florida law she had no choice but to vote for his acquittal. Earlier, a white juror said in a television interview that she accepted Zimmerman's claim of self-defense and that he was justified in shooting Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the verdict, Martin's parents and activists have held rallies around the country urging the Justice Department to consider federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman and calling for reforms to gun laws such as &quot;stand your ground&quot; that jurors and legal experts say played a role in Zimmerman's acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henderson, a Detroit radio news talk show host, was clear on why his opinions about the case track with those of many African Americans. He thought that Martin was profiled by Zimmerman because of his skin color, a perspective that he said is informed by experience. When he was 15, Henderson said, police in Los Angeles detained him because he was wearing the same color shirt as a black man suspected in a purse snatching. The officers handcuffed him and pushed him in the back seat of a patrol car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My heart was racing. I was as nervous as can be,&quot; Henderson said, recalling that day in the late 1970s. Had his white friend's mother not come running out of an office shouting, &quot;He didn't do it,&quot; Henderson said, &quot;who knows what would've happened.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think about how many brothers have been in the back seat of that car and there was nobody who could come,&quot; Henderson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muth, 56, a retired airline industry worker living in the Tampa Bay area, was just as clear on why his opinions track with those of many white people. The Retreat at Twin Lakes, the gated community where the shooting occurred on Feb. 26, 2012, had recently experienced several burglaries and, according to Zimmerman's accounts, Martin, who was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, was &quot;acting suspicious.&quot; Muth said it is not surprising that the teenager caught Zimmerman's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no way of knowing who approached whom and initiated the confrontation that led to Martin's death, Muth said, citing indecisive reports. Still, Muth, a gun advocate, believed Zimmerman had a right to be armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also believes that black people are profiled, sometimes unfairly, but there's a reason for it. &quot;I think there's a stereotype, and some people feed the stereotype, like hip-hop culture. There is a bias, prejudice or profiling that comes from experience.&quot; Muth added: &quot;There's a perception that young black men are disrespectful of authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henderson's and Muth's views align with social research on racial attitudes toward the criminal justice system that has been collected for decades. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not at all surprising that Blacks and Whites have such different interpretations of the Zimmerman verdict,&quot; said political scientists Jon Hurwitz and Mark Peffley, whose book, &quot;Justice in America: The Separate Realities of Blacks and Whites,&quot; focuses on disparate racial perspectives on the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our research, as well as the research of many others, has shown that African Americans are quite aware of, and familiar with, racial biases in the system, and the large majority of criminology studies have found these biases to be real in many respects,&quot; said the authors, who answered questions in tandem by e-mail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Hurwitz and Peffley asked why African Americans are more often arrested and imprisoned than white people, black respondents tended to focus on bias within the system itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But white respondents had a different explanation. &quot;The difference in arrest and incarceration rates comes down to their judgment that 'blacks are just more likely to commit crime' &quot; or that &quot;many younger blacks don't respect authority,&quot; Hurwitz and Peffley said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is often quite difficult for African Americans to interpret certain events without a racial perspective, just as it is quite difficult for many Whites to interpret these events with an appropriate appreciation for this perspective,&quot; the authors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls conducted in the days after the July 13 verdict bear out these starkly different views of the criminal justice system. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll, 87 percent of African Americans said Martin's shooting was unjustified and 86 percent disapproved of the verdict. A Pew poll also found that 86 percent of black respondents were dissatisfied with the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whites, by a slight majority, 51 percent, approved of the verdict, according to The Post-ABC News poll. In the Pew poll, 49 percent of whites approved of the verdict, with 30 percent disapproving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the Pew poll found that 78 percent of black respondents thought the case &quot;raises important issues about race that need to be discussed.&quot; But only 28 percent of white respondents agreed with that statement, with 60 percent saying race was &quot;getting too much attention.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama sought to bridge the divide and explain African Americans' strong feelings about the case in an impromptu speech several days after the verdict. He said he could have been Trayvon&nbsp;Martin 35 years ago and said that, like many African American men in this country, he had been followed in the past while shopping in department stores and heard &quot;the locks click on the doors of cars&quot; while walking across the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henderson believes that Obama's remarks rang true and the speech shows that &quot;having a black president matters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henderson sat down his son, Grant, 19, for a lecture that many black parents, including Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., have had with their sons since the Martin case captured the country's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to explain that you can't do some things as a young African American as others can, like walk through some neighborhoods without being profiled,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his speech, Henderson said, Obama reinforced that message. &quot;Black America needed him to say that, needed to know that he cared and that he could relate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, Muth believes the president was wrong to inject race into a case that, in his opinion, had nothing to do with it. Muth, born in Chicago and raised in Los Angeles, said his grandfather and grandmother would say a neighborhood was going bad because black people were moving in. But he said that his family never used racial slurs and  that he has a low tolerance for racists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman case &quot;was not the right battle for this cause,&quot; Muth said, meaning the issue of civil rights. He said Martin's case does not compare with such racially charged incidents as the bombing deaths of four girls in a Birmingham, Ala., church in 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local municipality there, the original district attorney, the law enforcement&quot; in Sanford, Fla., had it all right in their handling of the Martin shooting, Muth said. Obama, he said, &quot;jumped to a conclusion&quot; that supported Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To bring all this racial stuff into it seems counterproductive,&quot; Muth said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trauma nurses who took care of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after his arrest have a straightforward explanation. &quot;I don't get to pick and choose my patients,&quot; one told the Boston Globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three public defenders assigned to Tsarnaev would have been similarly constrained. But what about the two prominent defense lawyers who have offered their services? Why choose to represent a man accused of turning the Boston Marathon finish line into a war zone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, how can the lawyers representing Cleveland's Ariel Castro  fight for a man who pleaded guilty on Friday to 937 counts related to the kidnapping, imprisonment and rape of three women? And what about the attorneys for the recently acquitted but still controversial George Zimmerman? Do they really believe he is completely innocent of any wrongdoing in shooting an unarmed teen? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been a criminal defense lawyer for more than 30 years, first as a public defender and now as a law professor running a criminal defense clinic. My clients have included a young man who gunned down his neighbor in front of her 5-year-old daughter while trying to steal her car, a man who beat a young woman to death for failing to alert drug associates that police were coming and a woman who smothered her baby for no apparent reason. These are the kinds of cases that prompt people to ask: &quot;How can you represent those people?&quot; All criminal defense lawyers are asked this; it's such a part of the criminal defense experience that it's simply known as &quot;the question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of us have a repertoire of stock replies about how the system can't work without good lawyers on both sides, or the harshness of punishment, or the excessive number of people - especially minorities - locked up in this country. Capital defenders such as Tsarnaev lawyer Judy Clarke tend to cite their opposition to the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But our motivations are usually personal and sometimes difficult to articulate. I often say I was inspired by &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&quot; There is no more compelling figure than Atticus Finch defending a wrongly accused poor black man. Innocence, though, is not a chief driver for me. To the contrary, I often call my life's work &quot;the guilty project.&quot; Criminal defense is, for the most part, defending the factually guilty - people who have done something wrong, though maybe not exactly what is alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That works for me because, as it happens, I like guilty people. I prefer people who are flawed and complicated to those who are irreproachable. As legendary American lawyer Clarence Darrow put it more than 80 years ago: &quot;Strange as it may seem, I grew to like to defend men and women charged with crime. . . . I became vitally interested in the causes of human conduct. . . . I was dealing with life, with its hopes and fears, its aspirations and despairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers try to find the humanity in the people we represent, no matter what they may have done. We resist the phrase &quot;those people&quot; because it suggests too clear a line between us and them. Clarke has managed to do this with some of the most notorious criminals of the past two decades, including &quot;Unabomber&quot; Ted Kaczynski. &quot;Even if it's the smallest sliver of common ground, Judy's going to be able to find that,&quot; said Kaczynski's brother, David . &quot;There's no doubt in my mind that Judy saw my brother's humanity despite the terrible things he'd done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may even come to develop affection for our clients - as did the Boston nurses, who caught themselves calling Tsarnaev &quot;hon.&quot; &quot;There are very few clients I have had who I didn't like,&quot; Miriam Conrad , another Tsarnaev lawyer, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal lawyers are sometimes accused of investing all our sympathy in our clients and having none for victims. But we are human beings; we have feelings. Over the years there has been a handful of cases that tested me: sympathetic victims, unspeakably cruel crimes, clients who seemed to lack any conscience. I once represented a young man accused of an armed rape of a recent college graduate who was an AmeriCorps volunteer. She could have been me at that age - full of passionate idealism. It was hard to face her in court. I represented a man accused of child abuse who seemed to hate everyone, especially women. I admit I derived some satisfaction from the fact that his defense lawyer, prosecutor and judge were all women - even though I did everything I could on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people I have in mind when I say &quot;I like guilty people&quot; are not those who commit acts of such depravity that it's painful to read news stories about them. I mean the vast majority of my clients, who, for a variety of reasons, have committed crimes but who are not evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My car-thief client was only 16 when he killed his neighbor. He was immature and impulsive, and he'd had a hard time fitting in. He'd never been in trouble with the law, but on that day he got in trouble at school and was trying to escape his dad's wrath when he grabbed a gun to frighten his neighbor into giving him her car. Thirty years later, he still can't believe he pulled the trigger. He has grown up in prison and is more than sorry for what he did. I've been trying to get him released on parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My baby-killing client has no recollection of harming her 18-month-old. She accepts that she must have done it and feels regret and shame. In prison for more than 26 years, she has shown herself to be a woman of faith and service, working in the prison hospital and the Catholic chaplain's office. I took her case because she has served her sentence and been a model prisoner, yet she has been repeatedly denied parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My drug-dealing client knew the woman he killed - he once bought presents for her kids. He wishes he had made different choices on that day and at other points in his life. Released from prison after 20 years, he is grateful to have a second chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I realize this may be what every defender says: My clients, no matter what they may have done, aren't wicked. They are damaged, deprived or in distress. Their crimes can be understood as the products of awful lives, or of being young, hot-headed and lacking in judgment, or of not having the mental wherewithal to know what they were doing. There is always a story. Castro lawyers Craig Weintraub and Jaye Schlachet were typical in insisting, after meeting with their client for several hours, that he isn't the &quot;monster&quot; he had been made out to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If knowing our clients makes it too easy to explain how we can represent them, maybe it's better to ask whether we would represent other people's clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending Castro would be especially difficult for me. Although I have never turned down a court appointment based on the nature of the case, there are crimes I find especially abhorrent: child abductions that feature sexual abuse and hate crimes of all sorts. With its kidnapping, sexual assault and torture, Castro's is exactly the kind of case I find hard to stomach. It's distressing to read fiction about these kinds of crimes - such as Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones &quot; or Emma Donoghue's &quot;Room&quot; - let alone grapple with the real thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't envy the lawyers representing Tsarnaev. He is young - I can understand why those nurses were instinctively kind to him - but there is overwhelming evidence that he killed, maimed and terrorized innocent people in the place where he grew up. I'd want to say to him: &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot; But good defense lawyers resist the urge to pile on; it isn't a useful way to form a relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there's something about cases in which everyone is calling for blood that makes it easier to fight for people like Tsarnaev and Castro. Maybe there's a contrarian streak in all good criminal lawyers. Frankly, the uproar over the image of Tsarnaev on the cover of Rolling Stone made me want to stand up for him - or at least for the editors of the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I confess that I gravitate more to Trayvon Martin - the young black man unfairly targeted - than neighborhood-watch volunteer Zimmerman. But that doesn't mean I couldn't have defended Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent criminal lawyer Edward Bennett Williams once noted that he took on difficult cases for unpopular clients &quot;not because of my own wishes, but because of the unwritten law that I might not refuse.&quot; That unwritten law still motivates criminal lawyers, along with the knowledge that none of us would want to be defined by the very worst thing we ever did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We represent &quot;those people&quot; because we can always find aspects of them that represent us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A block party that Paul Soglin helped organize against the Vietnam War during the 1960s continued even after the war ended, as those of us with insight into future expenses to the city warned would happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, about 40 years later, Mayor Soglin says the block party has to stop! Wow, what took him so long?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he wants Rhythm &amp; Booms moved Downtown to John Nolen Drive. This would bring traffic gridlock for the event, with little parking for the estimated 200,000 attendees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should also not forget that there are many liquor outlets within a mile and a half of the proposed site. Families and others attending would be exposed to the drunks and the rowdy, destructive behavior we have experienced during the block parties of past years. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With recently released information about Stephen Heimsness, people may have changed their minds one way or the other about the shooting that killed Paul Heenan last year. I have not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer under stress is what I saw in the reports. He didn't get that way by walking puppies and bouncing babies on his knee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heimsness has, in our names, met daily with the worst people in our community and held them at bay, sometimes meeting force with force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the police union and management to blame each other is the tragedy. So is the loss of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need a process in which other officers, union representatives and management all look for signs of stress and help people attain the services that are needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a shame to need these services - it's a shame we can't find the cooperation to get it done so that the people who serve us can live a life of honor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sad about the judging, blaming and attacking throughout our political process - local to global.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear intense feelings, and feel unmet needs that are unlikely to be met without the consciousness, humility and vision provided by groups such as the Center for Nonviolent Communication (cnvc.org) or The Shift Network (theshiftnetwork.com), for example.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why has Trayvon&nbsp;Martin become a national hero?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death was a tragedy. George Zimmerman's life may well be another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am curious why this young man has become a national hero. Young black men are being murdered all over our nation by other young black men, but this young black man has become a symbol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An eye witness stated that Martin was the aggressor and Zimmerman defended himself. None of the Monday morning quarterbacks saw anything, knew anything or were party to the circumstances which not only made the neighborhood watch a necessity, but resulted in the circumstances of this tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, even the president has jumped into the fray. Why incite and further divide an already divided country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have a justice system and the jurors took their obligation seriously, knowing their decision could cause repercussions. Some may not like the outcome, but that does not mean it was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zimmerman had been dressed in a hoodie, walking in Martin's neighborhood and been killed by Martin, would we have the same hysteria?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Walker want Wisconsin to fail like Detroit?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michigan's Republican Gov. Rick Snyder recently approved plans for Detroit to file for bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to BuzzFeedpolitics.com, Snyder said &quot;the fiscal realities confronting Detroit have been ignored for too long,&quot; adding bankruptcy was the &quot;only reasonable alternative that is available.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to BuzzFeed, Snyder told reporters in 2011 at a meeting with bond rating agencies that Detroit would not go into bankruptcy, that bankruptcy shouldn't be on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Detroit's bankruptcy, workers fear the loss of pensions and healthcare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How financially prudent is it for divide-and-conquer Gov. Scott Walker and our tea party/GOPLegislature to pass a budget which funds the public school system while also funding the private school system? Private education is not cheap and should not be funded by Wisconsin tax dollars through vouchers for the rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are Walker and the Legislature putting Wisconsin at risk and threatening the health care and pensions of workers through tax giveaways to the rich?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Daniel Holzman, Baraboo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our justices require more oversight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding a recent letter to the editor titled &quot;Give justices a single six-year term,&quot; I applaud this author's suggestions, yet something has been forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be it one six-year term, a 16-year term or a life term, our justices are meant to hold their offices during terms of &quot;good behavior&quot; only. Common sense holds all judges accountable to the same standards of behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holding them accountable will control their tendencies to fall victim to the influence of special interest groups, and may even curtail abusive judicial review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our founders warned us that our democracy could become dysfunctional, and our justices are left unchecked, unaccountable. They have instituted an oligarchic system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must take back our government. Our representatives have failed us, and the judiciary has become the oppressive government that our founders once faced. What we see from our courts today is unacceptable. Let there be better oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Wallace Walker, Oshkosh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abortion makes one wonder about civilization</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislation passed banning abortions after 20 weeks does not stop all abortions. It still allows a woman who is around five months pregnant to abort her baby. And still some women are not satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes you wonder if civilization has gone over the cliff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At five months the baby has a beating heart. This little boy or girl has fingers and toes, probably a cute little nose and beautiful eyes - eyes that will never gaze upon its mother's face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And God forbid that we should put these women through an ultrasound!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do we allow abortion to be called a health issue? What is healthy about aborting a baby? Is it any different than throwing a baby into a lion's den? Would the baby be any less savaged?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What abortion supporters are doing is making evil seem good. To get the deed of darkness done, they disguise it as a work of light.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there's no thought given to the people, only to political favor. Let the lines be drawn based on population changes, not on political parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government should let gay people marry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am aware of gay couples who are Christian. I am also aware of atheist couples who are married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither would be able to be married under most church doctrines, but both should be afforded the right to the pursuit of happiness in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personal lives of two consenting adults should be none of our business, much the same as our medical records are no one else's business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I believe churches have the right to abide by their doctrines, I believe the government has the obligation to allow gay people to enter into a legal marital contract, just as atheists are allowed to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We allow people of legal age of all races and religions to get married. Why are we afraid of gay people?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday marked the 60th anniversary of the armistice or &quot;cease fire&quot; of the Korean War, the first hostile action during the Cold War by a Communist country in an effort to conquer another country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We veterans who have been able to revisit South Korea at the invitation of the South Korean Veterans Association call it the &quot;forgotten victory.&quot; Without the intervention of the United States and United Nations, South Korea would have become what North Korea is today, and not the economic success it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 36,000 died, including combat, prisoner of war and non-hostile deaths. We should not forget the more than 800 with ties to Wisconsin who were killed, died as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action. There are still many whose remains have not been recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope and pray that our efforts from July 1950 to July 27, 1953, were not in vain, and that there can be peace between North and South Korea as there was between East and West Germany.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">782 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RICHMOND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been estimated in various group studies that there are 270 million civilian firearms in the United States of America and 88.8 of every 100 people own a gun. (Look out for those .8 people. They are more dangerous than they look.) All 50 states allow people to carry a concealed weapon, most with permits but some without. The state of Illinois held out as long as it could, but a federal appeals court forced it to draft a concealed weapon law and when it goes into effect next year, you might want to go slow and easy when debating prairie staters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is possible to get a concealed weapon license in Massachusetts and bring your gun from place to place in your car. Large capacity rifles and shotguns have certain restrictions, but handguns are sort of freewheeling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also have &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in some states which basically gives you free rein if somebody breaks into your house and you decide to maim or kill them. Florida's law specifies in part that if an &quot;occupant was in his dwelling at the time of the offense and that he acted in the reasonable belief that the person unlawfully in such dwelling was about to inflict great bodily injury or death upon such occupant or another lawfully in said dwelling, that said occupant used reasonable means to defend himself or such other person lawfully in said dwelling. There shall be no duty on said occupant to retreat from such person unlawfully in such dwelling.&quot; This means that you may not have an 007 rating but you do have the right to defend yourself and your family to the death. Of somebody else, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin at the hands of 28-year-old George Zimmerman and the subsequent jury finding of not guilty of any of the three charges ranging from second-degree murder to manslaughter is not atypical. The cable channels went their usual berserk and there is barely an adult in this country who is not aware of the basic facts of the case and the innumerable sidelights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the pressure of the Martin-Zimmerman case has been relieved by the controversy over the allegedly rock-star-like picture of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover of Rolling Star magazine. Just as with Newtown and all the other recent tragedies, a new outrage dampens the hullabaloo over previous tragedies, no matter their importance. The shooting death of the young man might not have lost its relevance but it must take its place in the long list of atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point that lingers with me is one that is a significant part of the picture -- America's fascination with guns and their impact on our politics, everyday living and future. I spent an important part of my life with men who were armed and dangerous. Their mentality was quite often pretty low and in some of them their boiling points were even lower. But they had guns, some of them potently big guns, and were well trained in their use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I myself was instructed in the use of a rifle during my basic training, but when I was transferred to the Army medical corps, I gave up the guns and learned how to deal with the damage that can be inflicted by guns. When World War II ended, most of the combat veterans brought home guns as souvenirs and an inordinate number of these weapons are still usable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily, they were not the wholesale killing machines that are available now. But you'll remember that 88.8 of every hundred Americans own a gun and a huge number either legally or illegally carry their weapons concealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, a wannabe law officer, had a gun, a black Kel-Tec PF-9.9 mm. semi-automatic pistol, which he had owned for three years. Certain personalities can handle possession of a weapon capable of killing a person or animal while others can't. For three years Zimmerman didn't know whether he could or couldn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then that fateful night he followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin around until he had the young man as unnerved as he was. Finally, frontal confrontation was achieved. Finally, blows were struck and the young man was obviously giving better than he was receiving. In desperation, Zimmerman reached for his gun which had been sitting protectively on his body for some time. I don't know if he intended to kill the young man or just scare him off. In either case, the trigger was pulled and the bullet launched its way into the young man's heart. Sporadic attempts were made by police and emergency medics to revive him, but nothing availed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had a cousin in Texas who carried a concealed gun for years, just itching for an opportunity. Cancer spoiled his plan. We don't know what plans Trayvon might have had. A bullet took care of them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year marks the 10 year anniversary of when our son, PFC Kyle Gilbert, was killed in Iraq. We invite all of his family and friends to the VFW on Aug. 10, 2013, from 1 to 6 p.m. to celebrate his life. There will be music, photographs and stories to share as well as light food and beverages available. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 3 p.m., we will be toasting Kyle's life and his service to our country, followed by a demonstration in his honor by the Rouleau-Holley karate team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We invite the public to stop in so we can share our thanks and appreciation for helping us through the last 10 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beware false courage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor of the Reformer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman only confronted Trayvon because he had a gun. Zimmerman was armed with false courage that night. His acts were nothing more than the acts of the coward he is. It has been mentioned that he was interested in law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well so far, George, your resume's not looking good (What do you think America?), but don't just take my opinion. There are those who aspire and those who wanna be. Mr. Zimmerman definitely falls into the latter category. Zimmerman said that he feels for Trayvon's family, but then interjected that if it were to happen all over again he wouldn't change a thing, and he had no regrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is nothing more than a grandstanding of his cowardice and a feeble attempt to keep alive his version of what transpired that night. Why do I feel Trayvon was put on trial when he was the one being followed by George? Why did George continue to follow him after even being told not to by a dispatcher? His response was, &quot;I have a gun.&quot; Which clearly shows that he relied on it and was prepared to use it no matter what. Is it not natural to run or even confront your stalker? Mr. Zimmerman chose to walk/run into that situation. Not Trayvon! Trayvon was just walking. Why would anyone walk, run, even follow someone into what might be a potentially dangerous situation? There's no good reason, unless, of course, you have a gun. Trayvon was treated as nothing more than prey. Trayvon's civil rights were violated at three different levels: state, federal, and, most importantly, human. While we may feel progress, we are also occasionally reminded of the bile that emits from the deep cavities of wrongness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately the winds of times past blow back into our faces, and it can be harsh. Let us not disinter and slight the souls of those who have walked, marched, prayed, displayed, and, in too many instances, gave their lives to ensure that men, women and children alike be treated equal. Let us not judge people for what we foresee them to be, but by what we are certain they are not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The George Zimmerman verdict is an American tragedy for families and in particular African-American families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When my son was 16 years old he had just left Annapolis High School and he went to the old credit union located next to the school. He wanted to go to the ATM in the lobby, but the door was locked. It was around 1 p.m. He left and caught the city bus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halfway down Riva Road the bus was pulled over by the police. He was removed from the bus in front of everyone and was spread eagle and frisked on Riva Road. They opened his wallet and found $10. He was asked by the police officer where did you get the $10. Forever humiliated, he was told by the police that someone reported seeing him come out of a locked building. I am 100 percent sure that he was profiled because of his race and this would not have happened to a white male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These incidents are repeated over and over with blacks. There is a residue of institutional racism that many has turn a blind eye or maybe people just aren't aware of the problems. A young unarmed 17-year-old child is killed and the justice system says it was self defense and no time is served. But, we have young African-American males serving long sentences for minor offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many people of all races who are working toward equality and trying to make this country a better nation. We need open discussions about race in America and not to place blame on any particular person or race. And most of all we need to pray for a nation that is seeking justice and liberty for all.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THERE are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.&quot; - Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distill it to its marrow, and that is what African-Americans have been telling other Americans since February 2012 when the unarmed teenager was stalked and killed by George Zimmerman, who, for no good reason, thought him suspicious. And it is essentially what President Obama said in an impromptu appearance in the White House press room last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We African-Americans see ourselves, our sons and grandsons, in this dead boy. And we hear no whisper of &quot;there but for the grace of God,&quot; but, rather, a nightmare scream of what could yet be, in a nation that would afterward slander them till it seemed they deserved what they got and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pointedly including himself among our number, in testifying that even the most powerful man in the world once saw women clutch their purses when he got on an elevator, Obama committed an act of moral courage. It was all the more remarkable, because it carried no political upside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that everyone understood. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me,&quot; said the president, after which Sean Hannity, a grand wizard of the extreme right, professed confusion, wondering if by this, Obama meant he &quot;smoked pot and he did a little blow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so it goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That coarse attempt at wit pretty much emblematizes the behavior of many so-called conservatives since Zimmerman's acquittal. They have redoubled their efforts to fashion a fairly ordinary teenager into some general purpose thug who somehow needed shooting, and his killer into some righteous street avenger who stalked him from justifiable fear, because &quot;we all know&quot; young black men are criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Young black men.&quot; Not Trayvon Benjamin Martin, 17, son of Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton. Because the first casualty of racism is individuality, the right to be your singular self.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what was stolen from Trayvon even before his life. It is stolen anew every time some pundit bloviates upon the perceived criminality of young black men to justify his killing. That perception is rooted more in stereotype and fear than actual fact, but put that aside and ask yourself this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What man or woman among us would be willing to let the rest of us judge them based not upon who they are and what they have done, but solely upon our perceptions of people like them? There is, for instance, a perception that methamphetamine use is concentrated among white people in red states - in other words, Sean Hannity's audience. May we treat all white people in red states accordingly? Will they go for that deal? Of course not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet we daily crucify young black men upon that cross and pretend to moral righteousness in the doing. Trayvon is not the first victim. He's not even the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is the one whose death has made us cry, &quot;Enough!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There comes a time when people get tired. So said Martin Luther King in his first speech as leader of the Montgomery bus boycott. From that fatigue grew a movement that reshaped America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hopes people are that tired again - and that it spurs a new movement to challenge not just laws, but attitudes so corroded and stained some of us cannot even muster compassion for the death of a blameless boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is wrong. It is unworthy of decent people. And so, it cannot stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thing the rest of the country may not fully appreciate is how deeply that loss of individuality cuts for African-Americans, how closely it binds us. So yes, of course Barack Obama is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. And let there be no mistake:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am Trayvon, too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wow! I was shocked to read that another Illinois politician had pleaded guilty to fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former state Rep. Constance Howard, you need to go directly to jail and repay all of the money you stole from the contributors to the fund you established, for the sole purpose of lining your pockets with cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are a thief and should be treated as a thief; spend some time in prison. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When will this stop? Illinois politicians abusing their elected positions for their personal gain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pension assumptions on returns unreliable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we often hear the primary reason for the massive unfunded liability of the pension funds is due to &quot;underfunding&quot; by the state, that answer masks the primary cause -- unrealistic investment return assumptions by the pension funds. Using TRS data, the unfunded liability increased from about $11 billion in 2000 to about $52 billon in 2012. From their &quot;Reconciliation of Unfunded Liability&quot; reports, $22 billion of the $41 billion increase to its unfunded liability was due to annual &quot;investment returns&quot; lower than assumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now here's the rub. In any given year should the state not immediately pay the necessary amount to cover the actuarial losses causing the unfunded liability to increase, then the lost investment income for the larger unfunded liability balance for all subsequent years gets attributed to &quot;employer costs in excess of contributions,&quot; also known as &quot;underfunding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2000, taxpayers contributed over $21 billion toward TRS pensions, which was meant to cover just the $10 billion employer &quot;normal cost.&quot; Instead it was fully consumed by the $22 billion &quot;investment return&quot; overestimation. Mostly because of these investment return misses, the unfunded liability increased each year despite the taxpayers paying more than twice what they should have. And just like the owner of a credit card who doesn't pay the full month end balance, it simply gets worse when the interest charges get added to the unpaid amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By keeping its investment return assumptions so high, the pension funds hide the true cost of pensions. In June the Illinois Policy Institute suggested that should the pension funds use investment rates of return prescribed by Moody's, the current actuarially computed unfunded liability could double. However, reflecting the true cost might highlight that employees are not paying enough toward their very generous pensions, something the unions don't want to hear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns don't ensure a safer community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been written about the right of George Zimmerman to stand his ground and defend himself, thus justifying his shooting and killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin when Martin held him down. Less has been said about Martin's right to defend himself when stalked by an unknown assailant. Had he no right to stand his ground and defend himself when being approached?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue is not whether one should be able to stand his ground and defend himself when attacked but what weapons should be permitted for this purpose; The more lethal the weapon the more risky the outcome. Martin was innocent of wrong doing and Zimmerman, in spite of not heeding instruction from a police dispatcher, apparently thought he was a law-abiding citizen protecting his neighborhood. This tragic event make a lie of the argument that guns in the hands of law abiding citizens make for a safer community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Choice of Trayvon photo devisive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can anyone tell me why our unbiased media keep showing an old picture of Trayvon where he actually looked like the innocent child instead of the real Trayvon? I'm sure if President Obama had seen a recent picture he never would have made his &quot;if I had a son&quot; comment. Of course that picture will help Jesse, Al and Eric with their agendas. Way to keep racism alive and well in America. The divide grows wider.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expedite permits for natural gas exports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be tens of thousands of Illinoisans who recognize the enormous economic benefits to be derived from the exportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States to the rest of the world. It would be nice if every one of us wrote to U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and encouraged him to speed up the export-permit approval process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That really isn't necessary, however, because Sen. Mark Kirk has already done so for us. In a letter cosigned with 33 other U.S. senators, Kirk thanked Secretary Moniz for his department's recent approval of a second LNG export permit and urged him to &quot;make decisions on the remaining applications in an expeditious manner.&quot; Kirk and his colleagues emphasized the environmental and geopolitical benefits of increased gas exports, pointing out that U.S. LNG can &quot;curtail the need for Iranian energy&quot; and ensure secure energy supplies for &quot;long-standing allies and strategic partners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time is of the essence, however. If the permit review process were to be drawn out over a two-year period as currently anticipated, &quot;By then, the private financing and market opportunities making these projects attractive may have dissipated,&quot; Sen. Kirk, et al. warned, &quot;and foreign customers will be forced to turn to other suppliers. ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liquefied natural gas exports will create and support thousands of jobs for American workers who are currently unemployed or underemployed -- engineering jobs, manufacturing jobs, construction jobs, support services jobs, etc. LNG exports will spur domestic gas production and increase state and federal government revenues, too, reduce our nation's trade deficit, and improve U.S. energy security. Sen. Kirk should be congratulated for passing on this vital message to Secretary Moniz. He probably wouldn't mind if we wrote our own letters, too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One aspect of the aftermath of the Zimmerman verdict that I have not heard about is the potential impact on Florida's all-important tourism. More specifically, I wonder if families of any color are asking themselves, &quot;Is it safe for us to go there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine the scenario: The family arrives in Orlando and stops for dinner. In the parking lot a couple &quot;good ol' boys&quot; who have had a little too much to drink (not too hard to imagine) confronts them and asks what &quot;they&quot; are doing in their town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Florida's &quot;Pick a Fight and Come Out Firing&quot; law, any normal resistance to these guys could be deadly, if they are among the many carrying weapons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISTANBUL (CIHAN)- Violent and nonviolent street protests are as old as human history, and sometimes these demonstrations have been the first spark of revolutions. Even during Roman times, people were accustomed to taking to the streets to collectively express their grievances, but events as radical as the French revolution are less frequent in history.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In brief, doing politics in the street is an old story, and people are more inclined to protest during times of political and economic crisis. In recent history, the most notable street protests happened in 1968 in the Western world and in the late 1980s in Eastern Bloc countries. These demonstrations changed the course of history. <BR><BR>Today, we're in an environment similar to that of those two eras. The devastating economic crisis in Greece, the Trayvon Martin case in the United States, the political turmoil in Tunisia, the budget negotiations in Bulgaria, the excessive costs of the Rio Olympics in Brazil and urbanization projects in Turkey like Gezi Park encourage people to organize rallies and come together to shout their disapprobation out loud. A number of demonstrations are taking place in different countries and continents simultaneously, and this is a fact worth studying. <BR><BR>The common denominator of these demonstrations is that they prove people's dissatisfaction with existing political mechanisms. People pour into the streets because they feel that neither governments nor opposition parties are hearing their voices. In the era of globalization, the role of worldwide communication tools is also critical. Protesters in different parts of the world hear and see each other, and even if they are protesting completely different things, they adopt similar symbols and slogans. And they encourage each other. <BR><BR>Another common theme in today's demonstrations is the fact that they symbolize the refusal of the entire political system. Protesters insult political decision makers, they criticize governments and heads of state, but most of all they repudiate the current unfair political and economic order. Thus, they are protesting every person and institution that they believe benefits from the current state of affairs. <BR><BR>It is undeniable that grave injustices exist within the global economic system, and there are many people who believe that existing political instruments are insufficient to deal with them. Besides, it is in the nature of democracies to constantly adapt the regime's rules and adjust them when needed through negotiation. However, even though demonstrations are part of the democratic system, they sometimes prevent democratic institutions from working properly. History shows that in many cases, street protests didn't result in more democracy and freedom. Some political groups will always try to &quot;hijack&quot; these demonstrations and exploit them to install an authoritarian regime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another common theme of these recent demonstrations is the fact that they bring together completely different segments of society. In the past, such rallies were often organized by trade unions or the usual political cliques. Now ordinary people from all horizons who have no political affiliation at all take to the streets at every opportunity with their flags, trumpets and whistles, or put up tents in city squares and parks. <BR><BR>That's why politicians everywhere are now looking at city squares to assess the country's current political atmosphere. Besides, governing parties are also calling on their supporters to take to the streets to prove they still enjoy the support of large crowds. In Egypt, for example, different political groups are organizing rallies in different squares simultaneously. <BR><BR>Nevertheless, this situation of permanent demonstration is not that healthy. There is always a risk of clashes between different crowds rallying in different parts of cities. <BR><BR>What is clear is that citizens are getting used to expressing themselves differently. So maybe it's time to modify our political structures accordingly. <BR><BR>BERIL DEDEOGLU (Cihan/Today's Zaman) CIHAN</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They once were black boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I raised them in the '70s as a single mother, mostly in Oakland, and Washington, D.C. They're grown now, but the conversation we've embarked upon as a nation in the wake of the Trayvon Martin verdict brings back vivid, painful memories of them as young black boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not a normal life, raising them in the inner city. Which streets can they walk down, which stores can they go into without being followed, harassed, or worse? Who will walk them to school? Not because they don't know the way, but because I was too afraid to let them out of my sight for one minute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've started this conversation again, but when do things change? Not only am I the mother of two black men, and now the grandmother of two black boys, but I'm also a member of Congress who has been fighting this battle in legislatures for decades. In the early '90s, I led the California legislative effort to establish the California Commission on the Status of African American Males, and proudly served as its chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we must recognize is that our issues with race do not just seep into our relationships on a personal level, they are endemic in our institutions, in our society, in our systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty years since the March on Washington and Martin Luther King's, defining speech, African-Americans may be &quot;more free,&quot; but we are certainly not close to equal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From cradle to grave, African-Americans, and men in particular, are still wrapped in chains, and it begins before they are even born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the poor prenatal health care they receive to a propensity for being born prematurely, black babies start their lives from behind, forecasting future health disparities, complications and diseases. When toddlers should be learning to read and share, Republicans gut Head Start with cuts from sequester and push early childhood education aside. We send our black children to crumbling schools that are understaffed and overstuffed, where they are far more likely to be suspended than white students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost one in two black boys drop out of school. Far too many that do graduate don't have good prospects for jobs, and the Supreme Court scaled back affirmative action this year, making it that much harder for students of color to succeed in college. When our boys realize they can't get out of their neighborhoods, oftentimes, some resort to violence: Oakland alone has had 54 homicides this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our young black men are folded into the criminal justice system at rates that make my heart ache. We have made strides on mandatory minimums in recent years, but there are still deep-seated biases in our sentencing guidelines, laws and enforcement practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our economy as a whole is recovering from the Great Recession, but black unemployment remains in the double digits and is unacceptably high. Because of this and many other factors, the poverty rate for African-Americans is more than 27 percent. These rates are deplorable and show a deep rift in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's more. The Voting Rights Act has been gutted. African-American household net worth is down to $5,600 on average, and the health disparities that plague African-Americans will not be closed without a full embrace of the Affordable Care Act. From HIV, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and heart disease, the average life expectancy for an African-American is a full four years shorter than the average white American. So not only are African-Americans living harder lives, but they are living shorter ones, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of these realities, memories, and statistics, what is to be done? President Barack Obama last week gave an unannounced, unrehearsed, heartfelt and difficult statement on race. He reminded us that we need to give African-Americans, and boys in particular, the sense that their country cares for them, values them and is willing to invest in them. We have to encourage them, support them and remind them that they have more opportunity than their jump shot. But first, we have to make sure that's true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we can't have this conversation at our kitchen tables where we look like each other and have more than likely already made up our minds. We need a hard look at ourselves, the historic and cultural context in which we live, and the institutions around us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need targeted resources for our most ailing communities; we need pathways out of poverty, ladders of opportunity, and not just a conversation, but a plan for action, which includes public policy initiatives. I'm so glad to hear the president speak out on this issue, and that he didn't just call for a conversation, he started one. I hope it leads somewhere, but we can't just talk: We must act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE many Americans who are upset about the verdict in the George Zimmerman murder case continue to focus on the motives of the defendant or insist that racism played into the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Protest marches last weekend had a common theme: Justice absolutely was not served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Actually, it was. Focusing on race is a sideshow. Even one of the prosecutors - who tried to convict Zimmerman for second-degree murder or manslaughter - said race wasn't an issue in this case. What was at issue was Florida state law and whether Zimmerman broke it when he shot and killed Martin during a scuffle. A jury, after hearing the testimony and weighing the evidence, and spending 14 hours in deliberations, determined in acquitting Zimmerman that the law had been followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts are percolating to change or repeal &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws. Oklahoma is among about two dozen states since 2005 that have approved such laws, which allow citizens to defend themselves, with deadly force if necessary, instead of retreating if they feel they're in danger. We support the laws. Nevertheless, a debate about their worthiness is not inappropriate. Legislatures approved them; legislatures or voter referendums can get them changed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Working to change Stand Your Ground laws, either through legislative or voter repeal, is following the democratic process. Using race as a basis to protest Martin's death and to demonize the laws is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reverse brain drain?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apartments.com has released its latest Top 10 Best Cities for Recent College Graduates list. Oklahoma City ranks seventh-best in the nation. Given that job competition is fierce - the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 11.7 million unemployed persons in April and just 3.8 million available jobs in March - the website prioritizes cities with low unemployment. Since new graduates' income is limited, Apartments.com gives high ratings to cities where the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment costs no more than 25 percent of a graduate's gross monthly income. Oklahoma City fared well on both counts. The ranking also took lifestyle and social scene into consideration, giving priority to cities with a high population of young single adults, especially those in their late 20s. Oklahomans once worried about a &quot;brain drain&quot; of college graduates leaving the state. Now, other states have reason to fear that their graduates will decamp for Oklahoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 70-30 split</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phil Mickelson got into a pickle earlier this year when he complained about high taxes in California. Mickelson had to walk back his remarks about relocating because the tax-and-spend crowd thinks the Golden State's high income tax rate isn't excessive. For winning the 2013 British Open this week and the Scottish Open a week before, the professional golfer earned $2,167,500. &quot;Earned&quot; is a relative term here. It's more apt to say Mickelson &quot;grossed&quot; that much money. Forbes magazine says the golfer gets to keep only 39 percent of the winnings. The rest will either stay in the British Isles or be sent to Washington and Sacramento. &quot;We assume the British government's share,&quot; wrote the USA Today's Nate Scott, &quot;will go directly to the Royal baby's binkie fund.&quot; High taxes are par for the course in the world of high-paid athletes, but if Mickelson were to move to Texas or Florida, he would at least get to keep the 13 percent of his winnings that will go to California. After paying his agent and his expenses, the golfer actually &quot;earned&quot; an estimated 30 percent of his actual winnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing against repeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since George Zimmerman was found not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, those upset with the verdict have argued for repeal of &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws. Those statutes, including one in Oklahoma, allow the use of deadly force when an individual believes his life is threatened, with no obligation to first retreat. It appears there's little public appetite for repeal, however. A new Rasmussen Reports poll found 45 percent of American adults favor having a stand your ground law in their state. Just 32 percent are opposed. Another Rasmussen Reports poll found just 34 percent of voters think the federal government should be responsible for gun ownership laws. Thirty-six percent believe state governments should have that responsibility; 17 percent feel that local governments should be in charge of gun laws. The findings suggest strong public support for defensive use of guns - not an outcry for stricter federal gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summer's savior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 17 was a scorcher in New York City. The week before, seven deaths tied to the heat were reported. People were desperate to find ways to cool off. That was the news that was fit to print in The New York Times regarding the heat wave - of 1902. Yes, long before the summer heat became global warming and global warming became climate change, July could be quite hot in Gotham. July 17 is the official birthday of air conditioning, one of the greatest gifts to humankind ever invented. An industrial area of Brooklyn is where Willis H. Carrier worked out a way to artificially chill the air. This July, 111 years later, the air conditioners in New York have been busier than the ones in Oklahoma City. Carrier changed the climate of the indoors by controlling it. He couldn't do a thing about conditions outside, but we're ever so thankful that a man from more northern latitudes created something that has made our part of the country tolerable through the long slog of southern summers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic math</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Obama administration is doing its best to put lipstick on the pig that is its economic record. White House press secretary Jay Carney recently touted the creation of 7.2 million private-sector jobs under Obama as proof that the administration's policies are succeeding. But Gregory Gwyn-Williams Jr., writing at cnsnews.com, notes there are now 15 million more Americans on food stamps than when Obama assumed office. &quot;That means that more than two Americans have been added to the food stamp rolls for every one job the administration says it has created,&quot; Gwyn-Williams wrote. And for every job the administration claims to have created, he noted 1.3 Americans have dropped out of the labor force. It's understandable that Obama officials would seek to put the best spin on their policies' results, but they should keep this in mind: When it comes to the economic record, math is not their friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Phony' baloney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama would rather Republicans in Congress, and indeed all Americans, forget about learning more details regarding IRS misdeeds or the killing of an ambassador by terrorists in Libya. To Obama and his camp, these are getting in the way of their grand plans - and they're bogus to boot. The White House press secretary called these scandals &quot;phony&quot; during his press briefing Tuesday, and used the same word the next day on MSNBC talking about the IRS mess. Also on Wednesday, Obama mentioned these non-stories during his speech about the economy. &quot;But with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And I am here to say this needs to stop.&quot; No, what needs to stop is this administration's constant blame-shifting and obfuscating about these very real and serious events.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE mother of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin said his family was &quot;devastated&quot; after one of the jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman revealed that she believed her son's killer &quot;got away with murder&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from the juror, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true,&quot; said Sybrina Fulton, the mother of 17-year-old Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with ABC News, the only ethnic minority member of the sixwoman jury said that she &quot;owes an apology to&quot; the Trayvon's parents because she felt that she &quot;let them down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The black Hispanic woman, 36, who has eight children, said that when the jury deliberations began, she believed that Mr Zimmerman, who is white Hispanic, was guilty of the second degree murder charge. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury,&quot; said the nursing assistant, identified by her first name Maddy. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But others finally persuaded her that there was not the proof under Florida law to convict Mr Zimmerman, 29, a neighbourhood watch volunteer, who claimed that he shot Trayvon in self-defence during a confrontation in a gated community in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she said. &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her comments provoked fresh controversy about a verdict that led to nationwide protests and a heated debate about racial profiling and self-defence laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benjamin Crump, lawyer for Trayvon's parents, said the family was particularly disappointed to hear such comments as a unanimous verdict was required in the case. But legal experts noted the intense pressure on a lone viewpoint in a jury room. The jury deliberated for 19 hours before they returned a not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the slaying last year of the unarmed 17-year-old.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re &quot;Why do people hate their jobs?,&quot; July 8: I'm not so sure it's the job itself that people hate. I'm inclined to think it's the long hours we have to work and the lack of decent vacation time. In Europe and the UK, they don't have to work as many hours in a week; they get a lot more public holidays and much more vacation time than we do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think if people were not so darn stressed, tired and run-down, they would cope with and enjoy their jobs a lot more. Our kids would be happier and not sent off to day care for eight to nine hours a day (longer for some poor kids), and Mom and Dad could be home more during summer vacation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of us want the lifestyle that two incomes provide but, like everything else in life, usually there is a cost to be paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone gets home, eats fast food from the drive-through, runs to any sports or other activity the kids are in, gets kids ready for bed and school - and oh, did I mention homework? Is it any wonder we hate our jobs? After kids go to bed, lots of people still have to do more work in preparation for the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wonder why so many people get divorced; there's no time for the married couple. With six or fewer hours of sleep and an early rise the next day, who's happy to go to work? And don't forget the boss you love to hate; they just went through the same things you did the night before. So everyone is stressed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Zimmerman verdict a travesty of justice'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the evidence and circumstances, the Zimmerman verdict by the six-woman jury (mostly white women) was a travesty of justice. After listening to opening and closing arguments and ongoing testimony by witnesses, I believe this jury was intimidated by the defense lawyers' plea of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a travesty of justice that this jury allowed a man who murdered an unarmed child to go free. It's unbelievable the jury believed the defense lawyers' constant harping about reasonable doubt. There was no doubt that Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman with his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a badly chosen jury. Where were the male and African-American jurors?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More facts needed on speed cameras</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several weeks ago the newspaper ran a story on the accuracy of radars connected with speed-monitoring cameras. Factual and much appreciated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please consider another story - one on red-light cameras - covering the timing of yellow lights relative to state requirements; the legal definitions of an intersection and running a red light; and what is required to trigger a camera. For example, is being in an intersection when a light turns red sufficient to trigger a camera? As I understand the law, this would not be grounds for a ticket. Also, I have read about drivers getting a ticket for not stopping before making a right turn on red. Is this true, and what determines how long a car has to stop before making the turn? You may think of other factors to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I support traffic-monitoring cameras, provided they are fairly and legally implemented. Shortening the timing on the yellow light below requirements and positioning a speed camera without proper warning of the legal speed, for example, appear to be entrapment to me, and should be addressed by the courts or the legislature. But considering the number of drivers who routinely exceed the posted speed limit by more than 10 mph and enter an intersection after a light has turned red, some better means of traffic control are needed beyond the patrol car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No $700,000 for ex-mayor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the saga continues from under former Mayor John Cook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First it was the demolition of City Hall and the science museum coming after the issue on domestic partners benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, add salt to the injury. Cook wants the city to pay him $700,000 for his bad judgment in causing an attempt to recall him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cook, you need to move-on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Mayor Oscar Leeser, when will the complete audit on city department heads and salary of staff begin? This will be a great benefit to taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria Garcia, East El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing competition in wireless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT&amp;T and T-Mobile's decisions to allow more frequent device upgrades (AT&amp;T introduces option for faster phone upgrades, July 16) is further evidence of the growing competition for consumers in the wireless market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon there will be four national providers of 4G LTE service that offers mobile broadband speeds of up to 20 Mbps -- speeds fast enough for virtually any video or other Internet application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We owe a lot of credit on this to President Bill Clinton, who set this in place in his 1996 Telecom Act, an approach that required these three kinds of broadband technology to compete against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington's goal now should be to see how we can continue this kind of brass-knuckled competition between all of these technologies and how best to incentivize the investment spawned by that competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Campos, President &amp; CEO, Minority Business RoundTable, Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dropped-off dog finds good home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to say thank you to the family that surrendered their dog to the Humane Society for adoption. I don't know who you are, and I am sure it was not an easy decision to make, but I wanted you to know he went to a family who adores him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is such a wonderful, smart, obedient dog. He listens, is house-broken, and has so much love to give. You did a wonderful job and we are reaping the rewards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, thank you to the Humane Society for the wonderful job they do. We were truly impressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elaine Coiro-Herrada/Irene Bromley, East El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman's rights violated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Eric Holder and Obama must call a civil rights violation in the Trayvon Martin case. George Zimmerman was unlawfully arrested. His rights have been violated. A jury found him not guilty, so shut up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O.J. Simpson was found not guilty and there were no protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leno Puentes, Central El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Storm drainage assessment fee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our business has been paying thousands of dollars for six years for the stormwater drainage assessment fee. It is quite obvious that nothing has been done to curb the tremendous flooding that occurred Tuesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doniphan Drive was again impassable. Mesa Street could have floated the ark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are totally disgusted with no progress in six years to correct this flooding problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Campbell, West El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stop fights when boxer hurt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was 13 on March 24, 1962, and was watching a championship fight for the welterweight title. Champion Emile Griffith was fighting Benny &quot;The Kid&quot; Paret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a good fight and Emile stopped Benny &quot;The Kid&quot; Paret in the 12th round, but Benny went into a coma and died 10 days later. The referee that night, Ruby Goldstein, never worked another fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emile Griffith died recently at age 75. He said he lived with guilt but kept boxing because he didn't know anything else. Emile said he was never the same after that fight. He would do enough to win, but never wanted to hurt the other guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight left a cloud over boxing for many years. It was sad to see someone die from boxing on national TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have remained a boxing fan and believe in stopping a fight immediately when one of the boxers is hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Curtis Drabner, West El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men establish women's rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules of life prescribed for women of the world have always been established by men, without their consent. Women's rights are being lost through asinine laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing horseplay in the Texas Congress, abortion-restricting laws against women, is a repeat of this injustice. Fueling the continued oppression of women are religious and social psychopathic men who have hijacked the name of our creator to commit oppressive acts against women. No human can ascertain the day of its conception, nor predict sexual anatomy, nor choice of family. It is certain, though, that a woman is the natural incubator of the human race. Therefore, a woman should have sole decision power over what can grow inside her body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henceforth, laws should be established restricting men to hold the pendulums in control until they are of age and responsible enough to cater for the planted seeds during intimacies with women.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you tired of all the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman talk?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe we have not done enough to turn all that talk into something positive. Race often is a difficult, emotional subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we can never make progress unless we do a better job of listening to each other, seeking empathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is where a group of thoughtful readers comes in. We asked members of our Email Interactive Group to search for positives that can come out of this national case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Active listening takes effort. But it's a key to understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LISTEN BETTER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think in all matters of change or adaptation, be it big or small, job or marriage or culture or trying to grow up or let a child grow up, ongoing talk without rancor or hatred is the most important step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as we can keep talking, communicating and listening, there is the possibility that we can move forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we do have to do it without getting furious or outraged, and we do have to listen to the other side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julie Mason, Jacksonville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS MEDIA SHOULD LOOK INWARD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the positive steps forward should be fair and accurate media coverage. We saw the picture of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as he was at age 12, not the age he was at the time of the shooting. Why? Might he have looked a little more intimidating? Might it have appeared that George Zimmerman could actually have felt his life threatened? Who knows?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury was not fooled by the attempted manipulation, but the outcry for shooting a &quot;child&quot; shows many more were. This does not mean I approve of what Zimmerman did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shooting anyone should be the absolute last option available, but the media perpetuated and inflamed the already shaky emotional response to the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about a news media that presents the facts, not one that pushes the popular agenda? That would be a positive forward step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angela Siragusa, St. Augustine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SET ASIDE EMOTIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an aftermath of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman controversy, it is critical for all segments of society to conduct an open dialogue across racial and economic lines without bias or recriminations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must stop pretending that racial bias does not exist today and start talking about how we can best deal with it in our neighborhoods, at our churches, at our schools, club meetings and social events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an elderly white woman I cannot walk in the shoes of a black man, but I must evaluate how I respond and react to those who think and feel differently than I do and participate in civil discourse, be compassionate and free of conflict or confrontation. Only then can anything be accomplished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama recounted his past experiences as a black man in our society before becoming a U.S. senator. His statements proved to be enlightening to some of my colleagues and associates. He was certainly correct when he said our young people are better than we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many prominent black men and women have discussed how they prepare their sons to act appropriately in public when stopped by law enforcement officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps this controversy is the opportunity for a teachable moment for us to follow our young dreamers in Tallahassee, to take a good hard look at the laws that need to be changed and how our law enforcement agencies are enforcing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still time for us to learn how to correct some of these injustices by opening our ears, our minds and our hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annette Cappella, Elkton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AVOIDING TRAGEDY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever you think happened the night that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin died, there is no doubt that this was a tragedy that could have been avoided. If you find yourself in a dangerous situation like this, do not let testosterone rule the day. Find a way to de-escalate the situation so that everyone goes home to their loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curtis Wolf, Jacksonville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOW MEN ARE VIEWED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Martin-Zimmerman tragedy can yield positive outcomes if it leads us to change the way men are portrayed in our media, change the way we relate to our neighbors and change our expectations for ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, men are often portrayed in commercials and TV shows as dumb, clueless creatures with no self direction or ambition. If this is the expectation we send, the attitude will filter out into the mainstream consciousness and be adopted as an unconscious template for acting in those situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to TV shows that portrayed men as responsible, wise, hard-working family leaders? I hope that we can extend to the every day men in our society the same dignity and respect that women have demanded for the last century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, I hope this tragedy leads us to treat our neighbors with the tangible respect, caring and kindness the Bible envisioned when Jesus commanded us to &quot;love our neighbor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, I hope the tragedy leads us to expect more from ourselves, to pursue the best and highest purpose for our lives, to do the best we can with the skills and strengths God gives us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This aim would be in stark contrast to being ruled by the emotion of the moment and satisfying our most base desires in the most immediate way possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheila M. Saffold, Jacksonville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WALK IN THEIR SHOES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who have not lived in the flesh of a person of different ethnicity cannot know what events have been leveled upon that person. Until all of us are willing to face the facts, there will always be a simmering problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's truly turn this into a positive by attempting to find out what a person of a different ethnicity experiences. Let's learn to work and live together without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We still have stubbornly high unemployment in North Carolina and in the United States as a whole. Yet Congress is not loosening the purse strings to fund sorely needed maintenance of our infrastructure such as roads, bridges and schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding infra-structure projects will put people back to work and rebuild our state and our country. I assume the concern in Congress is the huge yearly budget deficits. Yet we readily are appropriating over $1 trillion each year for our military to fight another war overseas and to build another multi-billion-dollar weapons system. U.S. Senators Richard Burr and Kay Hagan and U.S. Rep. David Price better start spending money in North Carolina and not keep sending billions overseas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's suspicious look like?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I resent the comment Paul Richardson made about Trayvon Martin being a prowler. Never ever, nowhere was it ever mentioned that Martin was prowling around on the night that he was murdered. I or no one else saw it written in The Herald-Sun articles, or said in the media. The word prowler was never used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young man was simply on his way home to his father's house in the gated community after coming from the store with a pack of Skittles with his hoodie on because it had started to rain. That's what hoods are for; to protect your head from the falling rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And another thing ? the trial was not about marijuana or jewelry. It was about a young man being followed simply because in the eyes of a paranoid fool, he looked suspicious. What exactly does suspicious look like? I would like to know because, I am a beautiful, attractive woman and I have stared other beautiful women up and down only because I was admiring something about them. Maybe their outfit, their beautiful hairstyle, skin tone. Does that make me suspicious that I am going to rob or kidnap them or something? If you don't touch anybody or anything or get too close, how in the world can you be a threat?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check your facts next time you make a comment about something you haven't been following in the news.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signaling that the box office malaise for tentpoles isn't entirely over, 20th Century Fox and Marvel's The Wolverine may only hit $56 million in its North American debut after slowing considerably Friday night to gross $21 million for the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superhero pic is still easily in the lead, however, and certainly isn't considered a bomb, though Fox was anticipating a $65 million opening, roughly on par with World War Z, which debuted to $66.4 million earlier this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine was directed by James Mangold, with Hugh Jackman returning in the title role (the two worked together previously on the 2001 romantic adventure Kate &amp; Leopold). The film opens four years after X-Men spinoff X-Men Origins: Wolverine played in theaters, opening to $85.1 million in early May and grossing $373.1 million worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STORY: Hugh Jackman Wants Wolverine to Join the Movie 'Avengers' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine is doing huge business overseas, where it's opening in much of the world. The movie's long-term outcome should be boosted by strong reviews and a strong A- CinemaScore; X-Men Origins was roundly bashed by critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set sometime after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan (Jackman) has renounced his superhero powers and is living as a recluse in the Yukon. However, he's drawn back into the world when a Japanese man he once saved requests to become immortal. He also asks that Logan protect his granddaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox spent just under $120 million to make Wolverine after tax rebates, a fairly reasonable number for a superhero summer tentpole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine is the only new major release this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, a flurry of activity at the specialty box office, including the outstanding launch of Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine is six theaters in New York and Los Angeles. The pic, headlining Cate Blanchett, grossed roughly $175,991 on Friday for a per screen average of $29,332 -- and $5,063 ahead of Allen's box office hit Midnight in Paris.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blue Jasmine is expected to earn roughly $550,000 for the weekend, putting its location average at nearly $93,000, by far the best of 2013 so far. Sony Pictures Classics, Allen's longtime distribution partner, is releasing Blue Jasmine in the U.S.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two high-profile specialty films are expanding nationwide this weekend, Fruitvale Station and coming-of-age dramedy The Way, Way Back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station, from The Weinstein Co., impressed on Friday, coming in No. 10 as it grossed $1.4 million from 1,030 locations. The critically acclaimed drama is expected to earn $4.6 million for the weekend, easily beating The Way, Way Back, which took in $970,000 Friday from 886 theaters for a projected $3.4 million weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale, directed by Ryan Coogler and now in its third weekend, is prospering in both art house and African-American theaters and recounts the real-life shooting of an unarmed young black man by a BART police officer in Oakland. The film, which should end the weekend with a domestic cume of $6.3 million, has drawn numerous parallels to the Trayvon Martin case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox Searchlight's The Way, Way Back, starring Steve Carell, Toni Colette and Sam Rockwell, is directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who wrote the script for The Descendants. The film, a Sundance Film Festival darling, should end its fourth weekend with a cume of $9 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other new specialty offerings, CBS Films' raunchy comedy The To Do List, starring Aubrey Plaza, took in $590,000 from 591 theaters on Friday to place No. 14. The movie is anticipating a so-so debut of $1.8 million.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE mother of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin said his family was &quot;devastated&quot; after one of the jurors who acquitted George Zimmerman revealed that she believed her son''s killer &quot;got away with murder&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from the juror, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true,&quot; said Sybrina Fulton, the mother of 17-year-old Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  In an interview with ABC News, the only ethnic minority member of the six-woman jury said that she &quot;owes an apology to&quot; Trayvon's parents because she felt that she &quot;let them down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black Hispanic woman (36), who has eight children, said that when the jury deliberations began, she believed that Mr Zimmerman, who is white Hispanic, was guilty of the second degree murder charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury,&quot; said the nursing assistant, identified by her first name, Maddy. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others finally persuaded her that there was not the proof under Florida law to convict Mr Zimmerman (29), a neighbourhood watch volunteer, who claimed that he shot Trayvon in self-defence during a confrontation in a gated community in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can''t put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she said. &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can''t get away from God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her comments provoked fresh controversy about a verdict that led to nationwide protests and a heated debate about racial profiling and selfdefence laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Trayvon''s parents, said the family was particularly disappointed to hear such comments as a unanimous verdict was required in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But legal experts noted the intense pressure on a lone viewpoint in a jury room. The jury deliberated for 19 hours before they returned a not guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a US firearms group has raised more than $12,000 ((EURO)9,000) to be spent on guns or a security system for Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buckeye Firearms Foundation believes his gun rights are being violated by the US Department of Justice. The department has taken all the evidence from the trial, including the gun that killed Trayvon, as part of a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foundation''s donation for Mr Zimmerman is meant to be spent on guns, ammunition, protective gear or a security system, said Ken Hanson, the group''s legal chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protection &quot;The Department of Justice refused to return him his gun, and he''s in need of protection,&quot; he said. &quot;The money is intended to be used for anything he needs to defend himself or his family. He has complete discretion on how to use the money.&quot; &quot;  The money could end up being used to pay for Mr Zimmerman's defence costs and fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His spokesman, Shawn Vincent, said Mr Zimmerman has been offered free guns, but such donations have not been accepted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Diamond is a criminal defense attorney at Diamond &amp; Associates located in Los Angeles, California. Attorney Diamond was recently a featured guest speaker on several radio shows and on a major Television station to discuss the high profile Zimmerman murder trial involving the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford, Florida.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin took place on the eve of February 26, 2012 in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, where Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was staying temporarily. George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old mixed race Hispanic was the neighborhood watch coordinator for the gated community where the fatal shooting took place. After Zimmerman placed a call to police, law enforcement arrived within two minutes of the fatal shooting that took place during the scuffle. <BR>Zimmerman was taken into custody, treated for his head wounds and subsequently questioned for five hours. The police chief released Zimmerman for lack of evidence and lack of legal grounds to make an arrest and said that Zimmerman has the right to defend himself and use lethal force. However, six weeks after the shooting, Zimmerman was facing murder charges and was appointed a special prosecutor by Governor Rick Scott. The high profile and highly controversial murder trial began on June 10, 2013 in Sanford, Florida and Zimmerman was acquitted on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges by a jury on July 13, 2013. <BR>Throughout the case, attorney David Diamond was called upon as legal expert to discuss the Zimmerman case and featured on several radio shows and on Television. Los Angeles criminal defense attorney David Diamond was a guest speaker where he discussed the Zimmerman case on the Financial Survivor Network, the Amy Beth Arkawy Show, the Think Tank (AM 870/FM 105.3), Newstalk AM 1470 in Tampa Bay, and America's Radio News. David Diamond also appeared in person on Fox 11 News in Southern California where he discussed the Zimmerman verdict. <BR>David Diamond practices criminal defense in Los Angeles, California at Diamond &amp; Associates. Attorney Diamond is a State Bar Certified Criminal Law Specialist; he was included in Southern California's selection of Rising Stars[#x2120] for 2009, 2010, and 2011; he is an Associate Adjunct Professor of Law at Southwestern School of Law in the Trial Advocacy Honors Program; and he is an Associate Professor of Criminal Justice at National University.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can there be any question now that misbegotten &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws can provide a legal cover for murder?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching the distressing ABC News interview with one of the George Zimmerman jurors   the only non-white juror and the only one who began deliberations believing Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder   it's hard to come to any other conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people have said George Zimmerman got away with murder,&quot; ABC's Robin Roberts began. &quot;How do you respond to that?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder,&quot; replied the 36-year-old juror, identified only as Maddy. &quot;But you can't get away from God. At the end of the day ... the law couldn't prove it. We just have to believe in the Lord that if he has to pay, he will pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonbeliever, I take little comfort in her theory that Zimmerman will meet his justice in the next world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is reassuring, however, that President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and even Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain have tried to launch a national conversation about &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws that could put at least some pressure on the 30 states that have adopted them. If states won't fix the laws, maybe juries will reclaim some power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any time the National Rifle Association is the main backer of legislation, as it has been on this issue, you can be sure the outcome is aimed at more gunplay, not less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, there are times when homicide is a justifiable response to threat of great bodily harm or death. But these laws encourage people to engineer aggressive, armed confrontations, when they should be encouraged to do all in their power to walk away. They enable the kind of tragedy that Zimmerman inflicted the night he decided that a teenager on his way home from a store looked suspicious and needed to be followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy told ABC News that had she followed her heart, she would have held out for a guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the juror that was gonna give them a hung jury,&quot; she said. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish she held out, but I can't blame her for following the letter of the law, and not quite grasping how much power she really possessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the reaction to the verdict in the days after the trial overwhelmed her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I literally fell on my knees and I broke down, my husband was holding me, and I was screaming and crying and I kept saying to myself, 'I feel like I killed him.'&quot; She said she has had trouble sleeping and eating. &quot;I feel that I was forcibly included in Trayvon Martin's death,&quot; she told ABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday at a conference of the National Urban League in Philadelphia, Martin's mother, Sabryna Fulton, urged the audience to work against &quot;stand your ground&quot; legislation, describing it as &quot;a law that has prevented the person who shot and killed my son to be held accountable, and to pay for this awful crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is worth remembering that if Zimmerman had shot Martin before Florida passed its &quot;stand your ground&quot; law in 2005, the jury would have been instructed that the shooter &quot;cannot justify his use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm if by retreating he could have avoided the need to use that force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That might have given Maddy all the moral ammunition she needed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm hoping that most of the folks wound up about the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman affair have gotten it out of their systems by now. Because there are few letters-to-the-editor topics that have been tougher to handle, with the possible exception the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past couple of weeks, I have been called a racist, a censor, an &quot;Obama lover,&quot; a propagandist and a Nazi. I have been accused of promoting bigotry, conspiring to kill the First Amendment, conspiring with the gun lobby and hanging out with the ACLU. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the criticism was hurled by those whose letters we wouldn't run. Some came from others upset about those we did run. And, unfortunately, I don't think anything worthwhile came from any of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Zimmerman's acquittal, most of the letters to The Herald have applauded or criticized the verdict, but most didn't stop there. Many went on to criticize those who felt differently, and the purpose of quite a few of them seemed to be to provoke and diminish those who felt differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until earlier this year, my duties as editor included editing and processing the letters to the editor. It was surprisingly time consuming, so earlier this year I cajoled another newsroom employee, Clark Coleman, to take over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either out of conscientiousness or foolishness, I have continued reviewing most of the letters on some days and I often make the decision on which will or won't run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be a difficult job (yes, I'd like some cheese with my whine). That's mainly because I'm a First Amendment guy. I'm big on giving people an opportunity to express themselves. And sometimes, I'm too big on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the letters   on both sides, but especially from the Zimmerman supporters   have gone too far in ascribing suspect motivations. Some have been borderline racist against people of various shades, and some have simply been mean. Most of those went into the shredder, but some made their way into the paper. If someone recalls having seen any that actually contained a good idea about eliminating racial tensions, I'd love to be reminded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, it has been a depressing experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I was sprouting into my teenage years a half century ago, I lived in the South for a time. There were drinking fountains labeled &quot;colored,&quot; separate but distinctly unequal. I went to an integrated elementary school and a segregated middle school. When our school played our all-black rival in football, the people in our stands chanted racist taunts across the field. Security guards were posted strategically to make sure those on the other side didn't get uppity about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty years later and the Martin/Zimmerman affair shows that we're still idiots when it comes to race. There are many among us who believe that most black teenagers are criminals, that most Latinos are gangsters. There are quite a few blacks and Latinos who distrust almost all white people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're still idiots about race and some among us felt it was a good idea to prove it by writing letters to the editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was hoping for a debate about &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws and about jury selection, gun control, concealed weapons laws, consciousness-raising programs, successful efforts to combat racism in the schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we got was accusations of hypocrisy, favoritism, immaturity, posturing and profiteering. The president got accused of intolerance, jurors got accused of stupidity and I got accused of being a bad person, both generally and specifically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than discussing the issues, letter writers seemed to want to create a contest. Some wanted to prove the black perspective wrong. Some wanted to prove the whites wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few wanted to learn about anyone else. Most seemed to feel that they spoke the truth and that opposing views didn't deserve their attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, it has been a depressing experience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the former manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's San Francisco Airports District Office, I have followed the progress of Monterey Regional Airport's Runway Safety Area Improvements Project from its inception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This project is in response to 2006 congressional action that mandated that the FAA ensure that all commercial service airports implement runway safety areas that meet FAA standards no later than 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having served in FAA positions in airport engineering and planning, I am very familiar with FAA standards. These standards do not allow service roads to cross runways. Given the difficult site constraints, the alternative selected by the Monterey Airport District to accomplish the project is the most feasible. The district's Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report clearly stated the necessity of locating the service roads beyond the ends of the runway safety areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This project is a federally mandated safety project. It has been evaluated by the FAA according to the National Environmental Policy Act and found environmentally acceptable. The FAA is committed to funding the project. The unfortunate recent Asiana Airlines accident at San Francisco International Airport underscores the urgent need for Monterey's project to move forward.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important issues than Zimmerman case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am fed up with all the nonsense about the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case. It's over, the verdict is in, Zimmerman was acquitted, so let's move on. It's time for Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, President Barack Obama and the like to stop and move on to more pressing issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they really want to do some good for the black community, they can start by focusing their attention on more pressing issues such as the out-of-control (black on black) youth gang killings that are rampant in Chicago. Why don't we hear anything about that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many more pressing issues that these folks ignore, as do the mainstream media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, let's move on to something else. Hey, I have an idea for Zimmerman: Change your name to Benghazi and we'll be overtaken by an eerie silence; we won't hear another word about the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're also the home of the brave</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I truly cherish living in the land of the free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our elected officials' oath of office rightly commits them to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. That's why I am quite disturbed by secret surveillance programs such as PRISM, the existence of which I previously dismissed as the paranoid thoughts of conspiracy theorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we not at an inflection point here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down one road we find a steady diminishing of our most fundamental rights and a marginalization of the Constitution in the name of national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the other road we have a free people and a transparent government that first and foremost defends our Constitution; that honors our rights and debates national security programs in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we'll face some risks from enemies foreign and domestic as that oath spells out. But, are we not also the home of the brave? Our representatives must recognize that these programs are a massive mistake that might be becoming of a fearful country of cowards but most definitely not these United States of America.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's finally get immigration reform in place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Senate has passed a comprehensive and bipartisan framework for immigration reform. Crucially, the bill outlines a pathway to citizenship, protections for workers' rights and provisions to reunite immigrant families. For many thousands of our immigrant workers in the Monterey Bay region, such legislation would be transformative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are one step closer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 1986, immigration reform enabled me to become a citizen, get good work, buy a Seaside home and raise a family of college-bound children. I wish the same for so many immigrants today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigrant workers play a vital role in our economy. They are the lifeblood of our county's two biggest industries, agriculture and tourism. Like all Americans, immigrants want the opportunity to provide for themselves and their families. They want the chance that I got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I urge all residents of the Monterey Bay area to continue the push for immigration reform in the U.S. House of Representatives, so that immigrants can achieve citizenship and participate as full members of our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration reform worked in the 1980s. It can work again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time is now!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Pro-choice' really means 'pro-abortion'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political term &quot;pro-choice&quot; is really misleading. It is not about giving a woman a &quot;choice&quot; at all. The term &quot;pro-choice&quot; is a lie complete with hidden motives and deception in order to keep the women of America in line with their agenda. &quot;Choice&quot; is not a part of it at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proof of that can be seen in the actions of the pro-choice movement. They have fought throughout the United States to stop any laws or propositions that would require a woman to see an ultrasound of their fetus, because being informed that their fetus has arms, legs and a beating heart would provide the woman too much information   it might affect &quot;her choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-choice movement would argue that such a requirement would put an &quot;undue burden&quot; on the woman. In other words, it would make it more difficult for her to have the abortion and it might give her information that would help her recognize that she is carrying a baby within her womb. They are not interested in helping her make a well-informed choice. Too much information might change her mind and save the baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real meaning of &quot;pro-choice&quot; is &quot;pro-abortion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA -- The mother of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the unarmed Florida teenager whose fatal shooting by a neighborhood watch volunteer has provoked a national debate over racial profiling and gun laws, appealed to a crowd of African-American advocates here Friday to ''use my broken heart'' to prevent a repeat of what happened to her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My message to you is, please use my story, please use my tragedy, please use my broken heart to say to yourself, 'We cannot let this happen to anybody else's child,' '' Sybrina Fulton said during a brief but emotional luncheon talk to a gathering of the National Urban League. She received a standing ovation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her appearance came on the heels of comments by a juror in the case who said Thursday that she believed Mr. Zimmerman ''got away with murder.'' Though the comment, in an interview with ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' has been the subject of much conversation at the conference, Ms. Fulton did not address it in her remarks Friday. (On Thursday night, Ms. Fulton issued a statement saying it had been ''devastating for my family'' to hear what ''we already knew in our hearts to be true.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, she spoke passionately, and deeply personally, about the faith that she said has carried her through since February 2012, when Mr. Zimmerman killed her 17-year-old son as he was walking home after buying snacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I speak to you as Trayvon's mother,'' she said. ''I speak to you as a parent, and the absolutely worst telephone call you can receive as a parent is to know that your son -- your son -- you will never kiss again. I'm just asking you to wrap your mind around that, wrap your mind around: No prom for Trayvon. No high school graduation for Trayvon. No college for Trayvon. No grandkids coming from Trayvon, all because of a law, a law that has prevented the person who shot and killed my son to be held accountable and to pay for his awful crime.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks since Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted, Ms. Fulton and Trayvon's father, Tracy Martin, have taken a higher profile, drawing praise from President Obama for handling a difficult situation with grace. Amid protests over the verdict, they have spoken out on national television; Ms. Fulton addressed a vigil in Manhattan last Saturday. Mr. Martin addressed the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, they are pressing the federal government to consider federal civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman, and they are waging a campaign to amend expanded self-defense statutes like the one in Florida, known as Stand Your Ground laws, that extend beyond the home the right to use force in a dangerous situation. They are also seeking support for the nonprofit group they established in their son's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 6,000 people are here for the Urban League meeting, which comes against the backdrop of plans to commemorate the 50th anniversary next month of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, at which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his now-famous ''I Have a Dream'' speech. Earlier Friday, the audience heard from civil rights leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat, as well as the Martin family lawyer, Benjamin Crump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The August celebration has taken on a new sense of urgency, many here said, in light of the Martin case and also the Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Marc Morial, the former New Orleans mayor and president of the National Urban League, urged attendees on Friday to return to Washington next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Everything has a different sense because of what's happened in the last 30 days,'' Mr. Morial said in an interview.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- No one knows the components of dark matter, the mystery of Mona Lisa's smile or precisely how long it will take Kim Kardashian to lose the 50 pounds she gained during her pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid this vast ocean of bewilderment, however, a small group of volunteers managed to expand the well of shared human knowledge last week by joining a daylong group editing session sponsored by Wikipedia and the Smithsonian Institution's American Art Museum in Washington. The gathering -- called an edit-athon -- was the latest collaboration between the online encyclopedia and cathedrals of culture like the Smithsonian to expand and improve Wikipedia entries, which are subject to the vagaries of volunteer contributions. At the same time, the Smithsonian is able to better publicize what's in its extensive collections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Wikipedia is driven by this desire to share knowledge freely with the world, and that is in sync with our mission,'' said Sara Snyder, webmaster at the Archives of American Art, a Smithsonian research center that held an editing session in March to beef up the digital encyclopedia's entries on female artists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These amateur-professional collaborations began in 2010 as the brainchild of Liam Wyatt, a former bartender, fire twirler, podcaster and vice president of Wikimedia Australia, during an unpaid five-week stint as Wikipedian in residence at the British Museum. The following year, the Archives of American Art appointed its own Wikipedian in residence and organized an edit-athon, enlisting local volunteers to create new articles using the archives' resources. Other institutions, including the New York Public Library, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis and the Picasso Museum in Barcelona have joined what has been called the GLAM-Wiki initiative. (GLAM stands for galleries, libraries, archives and museums.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Institutions like the British Museum and the Smithsonian recognize that they cannot compete with Wikipedia's popularity. Many more people searching for information online about the Smithsonian go to Wikipedia rather than the Smithsonian's own Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several members of the Smithsonian's social media staff joined the dozen or so Wikipedia editors and novices who were lured to the American Art Museum last Friday by the prospect of disseminating knowledge, a behind-the-scenes tour and a free lunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While somebody could just as easily add Wikipedia entries while home alone in skivvies, sitting around a conference table with a laptop and fellow Wikipedians can be a great way to socialize ''for people who don't like to meet,'' said Gerald Shields, a Treasury Department tax attorney who lives in Prince George's County, Md., and is a member of the local Wikipedia chapter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Shields said he generally edited articles on North Korea and on feminism, primarily because few other people do. He combs through the English-language version of The Pyongyang Times for citations, and last year, even spent part of a trip to China trying to track down a photograph of Ri Sol-ju, the wife of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. At the museum, Mr. Shields, camera in hand, took on the role of the day's official chronicler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the first group editing session for Robert Greenwood, a retired police dispatcher from Catlett, Va., who has been editing Wikipedia entries, mostly on citizen science and ornithology, for more than two years. What got him hooked on the Wiki world, he said, was the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager who was killed by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I was a dispatcher myself, and I had listened to all of the recordings of 911 calls,'' he said. Rather than having access only to snippets of conversations provided by the news media, Mr. Greenwood said, citizens should be able to listen to the entire conversation and come to their own conclusions. He formatted the recordings and uploaded them to Wikipedia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the American Art Museum, Mr. Greenwood created an article on art conservation, one of two dozen subjects -- digital conservation and the artists Paul Cadmus, Leo Friedlander and Margaret Boozer among them -- that the museum had listed as needing more information or new entries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the museum's list did not necessarily pass Wikipedia's muster, however. The online encyclopedia relies on citations to determine whether someone is sufficiently notable to merit an entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fran Rogers, who is on the technical committee of Wikimedia District of Columbia -- a nonprofit group affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia -- decided to write about Betty Spindler, a ceramist, after seeing one of her creations, a clay hot dog with relish and mustard, in the museum's collection. Ms. Rogers said she hoped the inclusion of Ms. Spindler's work in a couple of other collections and a mention in a few newspaper articles would get her past the notability hurdle. It seems to have worked. No other Wikipedians have challenged the entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Rogers had come to the editing session primarily to help neophytes with technical problems. Like most of the other participants not on the Smithsonian's staff, she had no particular interest in art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madilynn Garcia, a student at the University of Texas at Austin, and her cousin, Chance Paglia, a student at Georgetown University, were interested in learning how to use Wikipedia to disseminate information -- but not necessarily about art. ''I know a lot about pre-Shamanistic native cultures,'' Mr. Paglia said, explaining why he was working on entries for metallurgy in Japan and the pre-Roman Empire instead of those related to art. Ms. Garcia, a summer intern at the American Alliance for Theater and Education, was looking at the page for Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Wayne Clough, the secretary of the Smithsonian, stopped by for a brief visit, he peeked over Ms. Garcia and Mr. Paglia's shoulders and asked ''What are you working on?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before they could answer, another Smithsonian employee distracted Mr. Clough. Ms. Garcia and Mr. Paglia flashed each other a quick smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clough thanked the volunteers. As he spoke, Mr. Shields and another veteran contributor, Jim Hayes, checked out Mr. Clough's Wikipedia page and decided that the accompanying picture could be improved. So Mr. Shields snapped some photos and soon substituted a shot of Mr. Clough with a couple of the volunteers at 2:21 p.m. Fourteen minutes later, however, another editor somewhere in cyberspace named Duckduckgo restored the original photograph and moved the new image farther down because the Wikipedia community has agreed that biographical pictures are generally portraits only of the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This is part of the way Wikipedia works,'' Mr. Shields said. ''Everyone can edit any article.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buckeye Firearms Foundation believes Zimmerman&quot;s gun rights are being violated by the U.S. Department of Justice. The department has taken all the evidence from the trial, including the gun that killed Martin, as part of a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal sparked nationwide protests and calls for federal officials to charge Zimmerman with violating Martin&quot;s civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder in the 2012 shooting of Martin in a gated community in Florida. Zimmerman, 29, told police he shot Martin, 17, after the teenager physically attacked him; Martin&quot;s family and supporters say Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, racially profiled Martin as a potential criminal and wrongly followed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s brother and one of his attorneys have said he receives threats and is concerned about his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foundation&quot;s donation for Zimmerman is meant to be spent on guns, ammunition, protective gear or a security system, said Ken Hanson, the group&quot;s legal chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Department of Justice refused to return him his gun, and he&quot;s in need of protection,&quot; Hanson said. &quot;The money is intended to be used for anything he needs to defend himself or his family. He has complete discretion on how to use the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money could end up being used to pay for Zimmerman&quot;s defense costs and fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman&quot;s spokesman, Shawn Vincent, said Zimmerman has been offered free guns, but such donations haven&quot;t been accepted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Perception of danger will lag a safer reality. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When yours truly was a young reporter, I worked out of a one-man bureau, often late at night in a city known for high crime and murder. My bride did not visit me in the evenings, and under no circumstances would she bring our young children to my office after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason was that, across the street at the police department, the windows facing the street were walled up. I was told the reason was that gangbangers would drive by and shoot through the windows. Scary stuff. Cinder blocks were a prudent reaction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't want my family inadvertently getting in the line of fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some might say it was racist to judge that largely minority community that way. But there is nothing racist about assessing the likelihood of danger and acting accordingly. When you hear a shot, you duck. When you see someone wielding a gun, you flee. When you know that both those things occur, you don't put loved ones in danger. That's not racism. That's common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama thought it necessary recently to lecture us on racial relations, prompted by the acquittal of George Zimmerman, a Hispanic man, described variously by the &quot;impartial&quot; media as white or a &quot; white Hispanic,&quot; for his self-defense fatal shooting of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a black 17-year-old, portrayed by the same media as a child victim of racial profiling. The president seemed to imply it was wrong for the defendant to have used the weapon, even though the &quot;child&quot; was banging Zimmerman's head on the cement sidewalk. If your head was being thumped on concrete, would you deem self-defense prudent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president explained that African American men suffer the indignity of being followed when they shop in a department store, of hearing &quot;locks click on the doors of cars&quot; when they approach and even being subjected to &quot;a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath&quot; when sharing an elevator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are unfortunate reactions. But, like avoiding at night streets known for violence, they are rooted in perceptions of reality. As the president conceded, &quot;African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system [and] are disproportionately ... perpetrators of violence. ... [T]here are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president used the passive voice, as if the criminal justice system is the prime mover, rather than the illegal behavior. If he were honest, Obama would have said, &quot;African American young men are disproportionately criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirteen percent of the population is black, but blacks accounted for 28 percent of nationwide arrests in 2010 and 38.1 percent of arrests for violent crime. Studies show arrest rates are proportionate to the percentages of the race of suspects identified by victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tragic burden that young law-abiding African American males are viewed suspiciously because of the disproportionate bad behavior of others who resemble them. But it also was a burden for law-abiding merchants in gang-plagued neighborhoods who are forced to close their shops at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a perception of reality is obvious, even to Jesse Jackson, whose reaction to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shooting was to label Florida, &quot;a kind of apartheid state.&quot; As Jackson conceded years ago, &quot;There is nothing more painful to me ... than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery, then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we wish people to stop making prudent decisions based on accurate perceptions of reality, we must change reality. The alternative is to risk being victimized so you might appear to be more tolerant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pastor I know has spent hours ministering to prisoners, a disproportionate number of them minorities. But when he entered the prison, an armed guard always stood nearby. That's not intolerance, or racism. It's prudence. Prisons are disproportionately populated with dangerous people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of minority crime can be traced to the devastation of the family. Boys go wrong without fathers at home to guide them. Unfortunately, that problem isn't likely to be corrected as quickly as it came on. Even more unfortunate, perceptions linger long after circumstances that give them rise may have abated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, the repercussions of high crime in minority communities are likely to persist even after those dangerous conditions are alleviated because it's prudent not to take risks until the track record is long enough to demonstrate it is no longer unsafe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be more productive to correct the problem at its origin, than to scold people for reacting prudently. Every day, broken families remaining commonplace only pushes further into the future the day when skin color becomes irrelevant in weighing one's safety.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father of slain teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is slated to appear at a Sunday evening rally in Riviera Beach, one of a series of high-profile appearances by Tracy Martin since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of his 17-year-old son. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riviera Beach Mayor Thomas Masters organized the 7:30 p.m. &quot;Community Rally for Justice and Peace&quot; at Hilltop Missionary Baptist Church on 30th Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with Masters, several local pastors are co-hosting the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as Tracy Martin and Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, crisscross the country urging the rollback of so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, Fulton spoke before the National Urban League in Philadelphia, urging the gathering: &quot;Please use my story, please use my tragedy, please use my broken heart to say to yourself, 'We cannot let this happen to anybody else's child.'~HOA~128~128~&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida law, she said, &quot;prevented the person who shot and killed my son to be held accountable and to pay for his awful crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's acquittal ignited debate over &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, which in Florida says a person has no duty to retreat and can &quot;meet force with force&quot; -- including deadly force -- if the person believes he or she is facing the threat of death or serious injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman did not use the law as part of his defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it was referenced in jury instructions, and one juror has since expressed regret that it helped pave the way for a verdict of not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tallahassee, where Gov. Rick Scott has said he will not budge from his support of the law, there is growing support for revisiting &quot;stand your ground&quot; -- most recently from one of Scott's challengers for the governorship next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nan Rich, a Democratic state lawmaker who in 2005 joined a unanimous Florida Senate in passing the legislation, recently wrote in campaign literature that &quot;stand your ground&quot; is &quot;broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, pressure for change continues to gather steam: Protesters who have set up camp outside Scott's office are entering their third week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Monday morning, both Martin and Fulton will appear with lawyers, including family attorney Ben Crump, and civil rights leaders in Miami at a National Bar Association news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The topic is inequalities in the justice system.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks after the man who killed her son was acquitted in a Florida court, the mother of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin took the stage at the Convention Center on Friday and spoke of the pain of her son's loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Wrap your mind around no prom for Trayvon. No high school graduation for Trayvon. No college for Trayvon. No grandkids coming from Trayvon,&quot; Sybrina Fulton said in an emotional address at a National Urban League Conference luncheon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All because of a law - a law that has prevented the person who shot and killed my son to be held accountable and to pay for his awful crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On July 13, a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the death of Martin, 17, in February 2012. In the aftermath of the verdict, people ranging from Martin's family to President Obama have criticized Florida laws that expansively define what constitutes self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Friday morning, a juror in that case said she believed Zimmerman committed murder but the proof presented was insufficient to convict him. Fulton said in a statement that the comment was &quot;devastating for my family to hear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Urban League, however, Fulton did not address the morning's news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fulton said that in the aftermath of tragedy, she was only able to advocate for her son's legacy because of her belief in God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At times I feel like I'm a broken vessel. At times I don't know if I'm going or coming. But I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God is using me and God is using my family to make a change, to make a difference,&quot; she said to a ballroom crowd of hundreds that greeted her with a standing ovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Please use my story, please use my tragedy, please use my broken heart to say to yourself, 'We cannot let this happen to anybody else's child,' &quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She told the crowd that on the car ride on the way to the event, she gave her driver a business card featuring a black-and-white photo of her dead son. His response touched her, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That's my son, too,&quot; she said he replied, convincing Fulton that her son's death has resonated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fulton and her husband created the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Foundation in March 2012, one month after her son's death, to raise awareness about violent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier Friday, Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump touched on similar themes. He said self-defense laws like those in Florida compromise the rights of children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our children are not criminals. Our children are not thugs. Our children have the right to walk in peace from the 7-Eleven,&quot; Crump said. &quot;They have the right to walk anywhere. They have a right to legally be without being profiled, followed, and confronted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crump called Zimmerman a &quot;strange, creepy man,&quot; and said the laws he used to justify the killing are &quot;dangerous to our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Laws should say, &quot;You cannot be the aggressor. You cannot start the confrontation. You cannot go pick the fight and then kill the person and say, 'I was standing my ground,'&quot; Crump said. &quot;It makes no sense.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is making that giant leap - founding a new cable TV channel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Combs on Friday said he plans to launch Revolt by late October. It'll be purely about popular music, of all genres. You know, the way MTV used to be before it dived into the (germ-infested) reality TV pool. Not that Combs faults MTV's business plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I was in that position, I probably would have bit at that apple, too, to be more than just a music channel and be more of a youth culture network,&quot; Combs, 43, said in Los Angeles, according to USA Today. &quot;But sometimes it's better to do one thing great. The most powerful thing that brings us together is music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revolt, to be available initially in 25 million homes, has a difficult, if not impossible, goal: rejuvenate TV as a medium by bringing the Internet-obsessed millennial generation to the box. &quot;My mission is to bring kids back to television&quot; with live, &quot;unpredictable&quot; music news, performances, and videos, Combs said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling the project ambitious would be an understatement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How much cash is Combs sinking into Revolt?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA -- Two weeks after the man who killed her son was acquitted in a Florida court, the mother of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin took the stage Friday at the Pennsylvania Convention Center and spoke of the pain her son's loss has caused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Wrap your mind around no prom for Trayvon. No high school graduation for Trayvon. No college for Trayvon. No grandkids coming from Trayvon,&quot; Sybrina Fulton said in an emotional address at a National Urban League luncheon. &quot;All because of a law -- a law that has prevented the person who shot and killed my son to be held accountable and to pay for his awful crime.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 13, a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Martin, 17, in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman was accused of fatally shooting Martin once in the chest. The defense said Mr. Zimmerman feared for his life when the two got into an altercation in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. Critics said Mr. Zimmerman profiled Martin, who was black, and that his unfounded suspicion of the youth led to the confrontation. Mr. Zimmerman is of Latino ancestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the verdict, people ranging from Martin's family to President Barack Obama have criticized Florida laws that expansively define what constitutes self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29, the second of the six-woman panel to publicly speak, on Friday told Robin Roberts of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; that she ached for Martin's grieving family, and that Mr. Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder.&quot; A portion of the interview had been aired Thursday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't put the man in jail, even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; said the juror, a 36-year-old nursing assistant and mother of eight. &quot;But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said there wasn't enough proof under Florida law to convict Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God,&quot; she said. &quot;And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with. [But] the law couldn't prove it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said she pushed for Mr. Zimmerman's conviction until she decided on the second day of deliberations that there wasn't enough definitive proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman's defense team had argued that he killed Martin in self-defense. The jury was also allowed to consider a lesser charge of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Fulton said in a statement that the juror's comment was &quot;devastating for my family to hear.&quot; But at the Urban League, Ms. Fulton did not address that morning's news. She explained that in the aftermath of tragedy, she was able to stand and advocate for her son's legacy only because of her belief in God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At times, I feel like I'm a broken vessel. At times, I don't know if I'm going or coming,&quot; Ms. Fulton said to a ballroom crowd of hundreds that greeted her with a standing ovation when she entered the room. &quot;But I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God is using me, and God is using my family, to make a change -- to make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please use my story, please use my tragedy, please use my broken heart to say to yourself, 'We cannot let this happen to anybody else's child,' &quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bereaved mother told the crowd that on the car ride on her way to the Urban League event, she gave her driver a business card featuring a black-and-white photo of her dead son. His response touched her. &quot;That's my son, too,&quot; she said he replied, convincing Ms. Fulton that her son's death has resonated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and her ex-husband, Tracy Martin, created the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Foundation in March 2012, one month after their son's death, to raise awareness about violent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Friday morning, Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump touched on similar themes at the Union League gathering. He said self-defense laws such as those in Florida compromise the rights of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our children are not criminals. Our children are not thugs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was ten days after 9-11 and the planes were beginning to fly across North America again even though the image of those hijacked jets crashing into the twin towers was still fresh in everyone's mind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had to take a flight to Toronto for a meeting and there was a general feeling of apprehension in the cabin as we took off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, as soon as the seat belt light went off, an Arabic-looking man got out of his seat, opened the over-head compartment, took a kit out of his duffel bag and began making his way down the aisle to the bathroom. Every eye in the plane was on him and I honestly wondered if someone was going to tackle him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, he too realized that everyone was watching him as he then walked a gauntlet of suspicion and fear to the back of the plane. Apparently he just needed a shave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remembered that incident as I watched the trial of George Zimmerman last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During that trial there was a lot of soul-searching about the issue of profiling people. Zimmerman saw Trayvon&nbsp;Martin as a young black man in a hoodie sauntering through his gated neighbourhood and immediately profiled him with suspicion as a thief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon on his side described Zimmerman on his cell phone as a creepy-ass cracker who was following him (cracker is a derogatory term for white people).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they eventually had a confrontation, Zimmerman ended up with a broken nose and Trayvon ended up dead with a bullet in his chest. As it turns out Trayvon was visiting a family member in the neighbourhood and was on his way back from the store where he bought Skittles and a bottle of iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus told a famous parable about profiling. In his story, some thugs mugged a Jewish guy on a deserted road, stole his money, beat him up and left him for dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of clergy-types walked by and left him there, not wanting to get involved. But then another guy comes by who has compassion. He cleans the injured fellow up the best he can, and then takes him to a hotel and pays out of his own pocket so the injured fellow can recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The punchline of the story was that the guy who helped was a Samaritan - the group that the Jews profiled as being creepy-ass crackers so-to-speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus used this story to illustrate part of the Great Commandment - that we are to love our neighbour as ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to be part of human nature that we stereotype the people we see as different from ourselves, treating them with fear and suspicion - which then so easily can spiral into hatred and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus said there is a different way. First and foremost we are to love God with all our heart and then we are to love our neighbour as ourselves. Instead of going out into the neighbourhood looking for trouble, we can go out with the attitude of showing kindness and compassion to those we come across.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And who is this neighbour whom we are to love? He is the Arabic guy who just needs a shave and the black kid in the hoodie.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'Forgotten War' should be remembered <BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today is the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War. It  should be celebrated across the United States and South Korea.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The war ended without a formal treaty, but with an armistice that  made possible a long peace in northeast Asia and that instilled the  ideals of freedom and prosperity in South Korea.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    We would do well to remember the gallant sacrifice of those who  fought with South Korea when the North Korean army launched a  surprise attack on June 25, 1950. An overwhelming number of troops,  planes and tanks crumbled the weak defense of the South Korean  army. President Harry S. Truman ordered American forces to stop the  North Korean advance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It appeared the war would end sooner than it did. But the Chinese  army secretly crossed the Yalu River and joined forces with the  North Koreans.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A hurried retreat and seesaw battles in subzero weather in  mountainous terrain took heavy casualties until a cease fire was  declared on July 27, 1953. It was one of the bloodiest wars in  American history. The total American casualties were 54,246 dead,  103,284 wounded, 8,177 missing in action and 7,000 prisoners of war  that were brutally treated. More than 5 million Americans served in  the 37-month war.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In addition, American veterans left behind a legacy of friendship  between the United States and South Korea with an extended period  of peace in a free and a prosperous South Korea. Those brave  veterans proved that peace is worth fighting for. The so-called  Forgotten War is forgotten no more.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Is A-Rod next?&quot; (Page S-1, July 23):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Our society has odd, inconsistent notions of what is worth  protecting. Consider baseball and reproductive technology.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    This week, considerable alarm is again being raised about baseball  players bulking up on steroids. Yet, applying the same analysis as  is applied to repro-tech, what's so bad about steroids?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A steroid-juiced home run looks much like a regular one. Concerns  about fairness can be addressed by allowing all to use steroids.  And objections based on steroids' long-term health effects seem  paternalistic. Why shouldn't baseball players freely exercise  reconstructive choice?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In contrast, few speak against the mail-order purchase of sperm and  eggs and the mass creation of frozen embryos, which are screened so  that the users can select their offspring. We even lavishly  subsidize these processes through health-insurance premiums.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Overtime costs soar at the Port Authority&quot; (Page A-3,  July 25):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Allow me to share an observation. The story cites, and correctly  so, that unfilled vacancies are partly to blame for the increase.  The sad and despicable 9/11 event is surely a contributing reason  for the vacancy issue but one must go back as far as 1994 when the  authority abolished many jobs over a several-year period. So it's  not only vacancies, it is, in part, because many jobs were  eliminated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Both governors at the time, Christie Whitman in New Jersey and  George Pataki in New York, agreed that jobs needed to be  eliminated. Pataki appointed two new executives to effectuate this  purge. The current Bergen County executive, Kathleen Donovan, who  was chairwoman of the Port Authority Board of Commissioners until  1995 and a board member through 2002, was equally enmeshed in the  jobs elimination.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Pataki was quoted after the purge that he was proud of the fact  that 1,500 jobs were eliminated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    However, what the governor failed to recognize was that, assuming a  modest figure of 20 years experience (many employees then remained  between 30 and 40 years until retirement), the authority didn't  lose 1,500 jobs, it really lost more than 30,000 man-years of  experience.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In my judgment, it never recovered from that bloodbath and loss of  experience.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It seems that The Record has an anti-Catholic bias that is so  transparent that it is a wonder that any Catholic would read your  paper.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman's future and divine retribution <BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In regard to the George Zimmerman trial, the judge made it clear  that statements about race would be sharply limited and the term  &quot;racial profiling&quot; not allowed. In that way, the prosecutor was  disarmed. So, does that mean Zimmerman followed Trayvon Martin just  because he wore a hoodie on a rainy day? What other reason could be  assumed? Did the 17-year-old look through windows or try doorknobs  or have burglar tools?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The truth of the matter is that Zimmerman followed the boy, asked  no questions and shot him. That is, unless you are one of those who  will accept that Martin beat a man holding a gun when there was not  a speck of blood on Martin's fists.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A court of law can convict, or free, a person but can a conscience  escape self-punishment when heavy with guilt? Perhaps it can when  there is no conscience! Whether he is a politician, a banker or a  priest, a person without that inner voice called conscience is  thoroughly corrupt and, therefore, dangerous.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Senate passes student loan deal&quot; (Page A-11, July 25):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    On July 1, the subsidized Stafford student loan interest rate  doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, causing more than 7  million students to incur an additional $1,000 in loan costs. The  bill that passed was sold as a reversal of the rate hike, but in  actuality, it would pay for lower short-term interest rates by  driving those rates up within two years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    That is convenient for students graduating up to 2015, but not for  students like me, who will be finishing college in 2016. Past 2015,  the bill would see even higher interest rates throughout the  decade.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    If this new agreement is signed into law, by the year 2018, an  undergraduate who takes out the maximum in subsidized and  unsubsidized Stafford loans will pay $4,700 more over the life of  the loan than they would have last year -- and $900 more than if  the rate stayed at 6.8 percent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The subsidized Stafford student loan rate doubling on July 1 was a  big problem. But this attempted fix will only provide a temporary  solution and make things worse in the long run. This is a bad deal  for students, because it will make the problem of student debt even  worse.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news about the landlord of Virginia's new health commissioner was very informative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as a public health educator/researcher for some 30 years at VCU's School of Medicine, I was curious about Dr. Cynthia Romero's preparation for being Virginia's health commissioner, a job usually calling for specialty training and credentials in public health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I have been retired for some years now and am no longer up-to-date on what Virginia law says about this, the past assumption in the commonwealth and other states was that a physician trained only in a clinical field (such as Romero's board certification in family practice) was not equipped or allowed to be the chief medical officer of a state health department. The past practice of appointing only well-trained and experienced public health physicians as our health commissioner was strictly observed. This made public health policy decisions comply with medical and scientific standards, not political or ideological ones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps more ought to be known about how and why Romero was appointed and why she would accept this war-torn position. Health commissioner is ordinarily awarded to public health physicians who know firsthand details about the complex services in a state health department, which protects the public from preventable disease, disability, accidents, death and mass catastrophes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for Detroit to start a new industry. Make the empty acres a nuclear and/or a hazardous-waste disposal site. Federal funds could be used. A training facility could be built. Sunflowers could be planted to absorb soil surface radiation. A laboratory could be built to research ways to neutralize hazardous chemicals. This idea would be a whole lot better than bankruptcy. And no, I don't think Detroit is a wasteland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You headlined a letter &quot;Believers can also support choice.&quot; The only response is, &quot;No Way!&quot; Believers cannot support the killing of an unborn human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believers know that embryologists state as fact that life begins at conception. Believers know that obstetricians treat the fetus as an independent life. Believers know that the fetus is treated in law as an independent human being, that the killing of a fetus in a criminal act is considered by law as murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides in this discussion, pro-choice and pro-life, are not on an equal footing. A mother has no moral right to allow her unborn child to be destroyed. This is what believers believe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tragedy when someone as young as Trayvon Martin loses his life in such a senseless way. The story saddens anyone who has children or knows what it is to lose a child. My grandson is only two years younger than Martin was at the time of his death. I can only imagine how I would feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Op/Ed piece by Leonard Pitts &quot;Wake . . . up&quot; has saddened me even more. I find his column incendiary. It can only serve to deepen the void between races. His bitter words help infuse a global perception that there is no solution to our social dilemma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This type of journalism has no place in a country struggling to eradicate racism and prejudice. The more the media focus on our differences and espouse anger and hatred at every turn or event, the longer it will take for us to understand and accept one another as the brothers we are. No law can ever accomplish this. This is learned and earned through mutual trust and respect over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, the day will come when racism and prejudice no longer exist in the United States, but words like those expressed by Pitts fuel more distrust and misunderstanding. It is a pity he does not use his words for inspiration and healing, because those are something that America desperately needs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supplements are safer than drugs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the article &quot;Regulations differ for supplements&quot;: The reason dietary supplements aren't regulated like drugs is because they're much safer than drugs. It's the same reason the Department of Energy regulates nuclear reactors differently than fireplaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the FDA drug-approval system the best model for safety? Properly prescribed FDA-approved drugs kill an estimated 100,000 people and receive approximately 550,000 adverse event reports a year. FDA-approved opioid painkillers now kill more Americans each year than automobile accidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dietary supplements can't go through the FDA drug-approval process, which requires expensive double-blind studies that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Because natural products (such as dietary supplements) can't be patented, supplement companies can never recoup the astronomical costs of these trials. As a direct consequence, natural (and oftentimes exponentially safer and cheaper) remedies are dismissed as ineffective and subjected to legal threats by hostile regulatory agencies and organizations like Public Citizen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 1, under the cover of a popular vacation week, Medicare proposed a devastating surprise for my dialysis patients -- a 12 percent Medicare budget cut. This disappointing plan was triggered by congressionally mandated fiscal cliff cuts. The cuts are so deep they could restrict dialysis services and force clinic closures just as kidney disease is growing. It's cruel, unusual and unjust to have critically ill people accept reduced care or travel longer distances for dialysis. My patients could die within two weeks without their three weekly dialysis treatments. The life-sustaining nature makes this budget issue unique, especially in Virginia where more than 15,442 residents have kidney failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you don't think kidney disease impacts you -- think again. The silent killer is caused by high blood pressure and diabetes and affects one in seven Americans, making it the eighth-leading cause of death. When the disease progresses to kidney failure, my patients must seek transplantation (which is rare) or get dialysis four hours, three times a week to stay alive. In Virginia, kidney failure has increased 15.8 percent increase since 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dialysis professionals like me have worked hard to improve health outcomes. In 2011 we adopted a cost-effective payment system which became a Medicare model. Yet our progress is being rewarded with Medicare cuts. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medicare covers the cost of dialysis, regardless of age. But it barely covers the cost of complex dialysis care now, and new cuts would be disastrous. Congress must not balance budgets on the backs of kidney failure patients. The sick and vulnerable deserve better.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local musicians need to eat, too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent article noted that the State Fair of Virginia is putting out the call for free musicians. As a professional musician, I am very dismayed that the State Fair and the Virginia Farm Bureau look at the local arts as an entitled commodity with no real monetary value. Furthermore, the Virginia Farm Bureau's comment of loving to work with musicians who play in garages, parking lots et cetera, will only yield amateur, non-professional musicians or hobbyists, which will just downgrade the overall quality of entertainment at the fair -- which claims on its website that it offers &quot;the best of Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no problem with periodically playing a charitable benefit for a worthy nonprofit organization, but the State Fair is for-profit. The fair is paying the &quot;national&quot; acts performing there and the array of electricians, plumbers, groundskeepers, even parking attendants -- why not local musicians?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure the fair will find bands willing to play for free, undermining the value of working musicians. And that's the problem -- once you devalue a service, it will be seen as having no intrinsic value to anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shame on the State Fair of Virginia for trying to take advantage of local musicians. I will be boycotting the State Fair this year and asking other musicians, entertainers and supporters of the arts to join me.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia could stand outfrom the rest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor, Times-Dispatch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having spent time in China with Charles McPhillips and Brad Haneberg marketing the many business advantages of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I concur with the recommendations made in their Commentary column, &quot;Virginia needs investment from overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese business has a very real desire to invest offshore due to its government's inconsistent monetary policy. The U.S., with its stable business climate, large consumer base and strong entrepreneur activity, is a logical Chinese target for investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia can stand out from the other 49 states by encouraging new foreign capital to invest in the commonwealth through a mechanism like the Virginia In-Bound Growth Funds option. As suggested, we have an incentive tool, the Governor's Opportunity Fund , to help leverage this foreign capital and keep the investment tied to Virginia based on job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an economic developer who has worked exclusively in the commonwealth since 1976, I believe we need to explore new ways of bringing jobs and capital investment to the state. Why not explore the Virginia In-Bound Growth Funds concept?It could provide a whole new stream of business opportunities that are not currently being explored.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror in the George Zimmerman trial on Wednesday called for changes in the self-defense law that she said gave her no option but to find Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With her identity kept secret, the juror, designated B-37, gave an interview to CNN on Monday that stirred further debate in the case, which captivated the U.S. public and triggered lengthy discussions about race, guns and self-defense laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After receiving a torrent of criticism, including a statement to CNN from four other jurors who said she did not speak for them, the juror issued a statement further stressing her position that Florida's self-defense law, commonly known as Stand Your Ground, forced the jury to vote not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My prayers are with all those who have the influence and power to modify the laws that left me with no verdict option other than 'not guilty' in order to remain within the instructions,&quot; juror B-37 said in the statement. &quot;No other family should be forced to endure what the Martin family has endured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the instructions given to the jury, Zimmerman had &quot;no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force&quot; if he reasonably feared for his life or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror's statement adds to pleas from around the country to change the Stand Your Ground laws that more than 30 states have adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three weeks of testimony and 16 hours of deliberation, the jury of five white women and one of mixed race acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death, inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford on February 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VERDICT PROMPTS PROTESTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before the shooting, Zimmerman called police from his car to report a suspicious person, Martin, a house guest of his father's fianccce, who lived inside the gated community. Zimmerman left his car and got into a fight with Martin that left Zimmerman with a bloody nose and head injuries. It ended when Zimmerman shot Martin through the heart with a 9mm pistol he had concealed and was licensed to carry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict outraged civil rights leaders and protesters across the United States, who said the outcome would have been different if the races had been reversed. Zimmerman is white and Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B-37, a mother of two who grew up in a military family and used to have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, said she believed Zimmerman got out of the car to look for Martin and that &quot;he could have avoided the whole situation by staying in the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said a holdout juror switched her vote to &quot;not guilty&quot; after half an hour of agonizing over the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She wanted to find him guilty of something but couldn't because of the law. The way the law was written, he wasn't responsible for (negligent) things that he had done leading up to that point,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to find him guilty of not using his senses but ... you can't charge him with anything because he didn't do anything unlawful,&quot; said juror B-37, who also said she believed Martin attacked Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B-37 told CNN that nobody on the jury felt race played a role in the case and that she did not believe Zimmerman racially profiled Martin as a criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four other jurors responded with a statement distancing themselves from B-37.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also wish to point out that the opinions of juror B-37 expressed on the Anderson Cooper show (on CNN) were her own, and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below,&quot; said the statement, which listed their juror numbers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORKc cAfter his acquittal on murder charges for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman may go to law school to help people wrongly accused of crimes like himself, close friends told Reuters on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year old was found not guilty late Saturday for shooting the unarmed black teenager in a case that sparked a national debate on race and gun laws. One of his first calls was to defense witness John Donnelly and his wife Leanne Benjamin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They got to know Zimmerman in 2004 when he and a black friend opened up an insurance office in a Florida building where Benjamin worked. They grew close and the couple spent time with him during the trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over dinner with Zimmerman recently, Benjamin said he told them he would like to go to law school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to help other people like me,&quot; she quoted him as telling them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, an insurance investigator, attended community college and was a credit shy of an associate's degree in criminal justice but was kicked out of school because he posed a danger to the campus, according to family sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody said he was a cop-wannabe but he's interested in law,&quot; Benjamin said. &quot;He sees it as a potential path forward to help other people like himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's defense attorney Mark O'Mara agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wanted to be a cop for awhile, but he's talked [more recently] about going to law school,&quot; O'Mara told Reuters on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has a real interest in the law and ... prosecuting appropriately - not like what he got - is something he's very interested in. I will not be surprised if he ends up in criminal law,&quot; O'Mara said. &quot;His dad was a judge, and he wants to be a prosecutor or a lawyer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experience shows that re-building life after a major trial may prove difficult, even for those acquitted of headline-making crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casey Anthony, the young Orlando mother acquitted in 2011 of killing her 3-year-old daughter Caylee, remains hidden and unemployed while her lawyers fight civil lawsuits seeking monetary damages from her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former NFL star O.J. Simpson was acquitted in 1995 of killing his wife and an acquaintance, but his life fell apart. He lost a $33 million wrongful death civil suit in 1997, moved to Florida where he was arrested and eventually sent to prison in 2008 for up to 33 years for robbery and kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREATS TO HIS LIFE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even O'Mara and Zimmerman's brother, Robert, admitted his life would never be the same after the trial, which has forced him to go out in disguise and wear bullet proof vests because of threats to his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donnelly told Reuters that Zimmerman was hurt very deeply by prosecutors' portrayals of him as a racist vigilante who targeted and pursued Martin simply because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The person they are talking about is somebody completely different,&quot; Donnelly quoted Zimmerman as telling him recently. &quot;Sometimes I have to go look at a mirror. They are talking about a totally different human being. They are talking about a racist. I'm not a racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zimmerman was anything but.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's been mentoring young black kids for years, he launched a campaign to help a homeless black man who was beaten up by a white kid, and he still just can't believe all the things that have been said about him in the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other friends of Zimmerman who spoke exclusively to Reuters remain angry at what he has endured since the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew the man was innocent the whole time,'' said Jorge Rodriguez. &quot;He called me yesterday to thank me ... for believing in him. He was just so relieved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodriguez is deeply frustrated by civil rights activists like Al Sharpton, who he feels pressured prosecutors into charging Zimmerman with a crime he didn't commit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody asked for justice, and they got it,&quot; Rodriguez said. &quot;Everybody asked for George to be arrested, and they got it. Everybody asked for George to be tried, and they got it. Everybody asked for a fair trial, and they got it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dismissed criticism of the prosecution, the six female jurors and calls by civil rights groups for a federal civil rights investigation. The Martin family is also considering a wrongful death civil suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now can't we leave George Zimmerman alone?&quot;, Rodriguez said. &quot;It was nothing about racism. It was about the community being robbed and broken into, and one man stood up. The state should be giving this man an award, and instead they took him to trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE: Moved to action by Zimmerman case, and not going away</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Living on pizza, sleeping on mats and asking for fundamental changes in laws affecting minorities, a group of young activists on Friday began their 11th day occupying the Florida state Capitol, with no sign of resolution in the standoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters, part of a group called the Dream Defenders, are keeping up a 24-hour-a-day vigil outside Gov. Rick Scott's office, following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old, in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And group members have said they do not plan to leave until Scott or legislative leaders call a special session to address their concerns, including Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense law and racial profiling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not supposed to be easy. It's not supposed to be comfortable,&quot; said Philip Agnew, one of the leaders of the Dream Defenders. &quot;We expected a no. We're young and idealistic but we're not na&amp;iuml;ve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest has been peaceful and civil, with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement only reporting a few minor instances of police intervention. In one case, officers asked three protesters sleeping in small chapel on the ground floor of the Capitol to move to another area. Officers have also prohibited the use of air mattresses, saying they had the potential to block access to hallways and exits in an emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders for the activists said their group has been treated fairly by the security officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have been very professional,&quot; said Ahmad Abuznaid, a 28-year-old Miami lawyer who is a legal and policy director for the Dream Defenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Thursday, the FDLE reported an additional $50,000 has been spent on overtime pay for officers watching the Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both sides have accommodated each other. For instance, while the protestors sit on the furniture and carpet in the waiting room of the Governor's Office each day, a corridor marked off by tape on the carpet allows regular visitors to enter and leave the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of protesters -- who are largely college-age students and young adults -- has varied, since they can come and go during the regular hours at the Capitol but are locked in at night on the first floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, 86 activists -- bolstered by a busload of protesters from Philadelphia -- stayed overnight, compared with 16 on Wednesday, the FDLE said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regina Joseph, a 19-year-old sophomore from Florida State University and a leader in FSU's Dream Defenders chapter, spent nearly a week in the Capitol, sleeping on a comforter while clutching a large stuffed dog named Wilson. She said she had to take a break by Tuesday. &quot;I was going crazy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the political science major has consistently returned to join the protesters, even though it means she has not been able to attend her FSU class this summer on gay politics and policy. &quot;I told my teacher: 'Sorry, I've got to occupy the Capitol,'&quot; she said. &quot;And she understands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although her attendance has been spotty, Joseph said she has completed all of her class assignments and has maintained good grades. And she said she will take a similar approach when fall classes start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I'm not in a class I'm going to try to be here,&quot; Joseph said. &quot;As a leader I'm trying set an example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph and the other Dream Defenders members have also emphasized that their protest is aimed at changing more than the &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense law that was originally linked to the shooting. They also want Scott and state lawmakers to change &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policies in public schools that they say target minority youth and lead to unnecessary suspensions or removal from the schools. And they want stronger laws against racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are racially profiled every single day,&quot; said Melanie Andrade, head of the Dream Defenders chapter at Florida A&amp;M University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To highlight those issues, the Dream Defenders plan to stage a series of &quot;Takeover Tuesdays,&quot; where each of those topics will be discussed by experts and community members, beginning next week. Some are drawing parallels to the &quot;Moral Monday&quot; protests that are taking place weekly in North Carolina's state Capitol, although those protests have been marked by hundreds of arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others see similarities between Florida's protest and the civil rights era. &quot;We're the new SNCC,&quot; said Joseph, citing the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee that organized protests in the South after a group of black college students were denied service at a Woolworth's lunch counter in the early 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott has been largely absent from his office. However, he met with the Dream Defenders a few days after they began their protest, although he made it clear he did not intend to call a special session nor did he support changing the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. He also asked Wansley Walters, his secretary for the Department of Juvenile Justice, to meet with the protesters and talk about their issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, who is running against Scott for governor next year, planed to meet with the Dream Defenders today, but the FDLE said she could not because the Capitol is closed on weekends. She said while they may face an uphill fight from the governor and Republican legislative leaders in changing some of the laws, she said their protest has brought a new focus on issues that sometimes don't even get a hearing in the Legislature -- such as gun-control laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many significant issues that need to be addressed,&quot; Rich said. &quot;I think they're shining a light on it in a very thoughtful, peaceful demonstration. I think it's exciting when young people become a part of the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A long wait may be tough on the young activists who use thin mats to sleep on the uncarpeted Capitol building floor each night and rely on donations and other in-kind support, including the delivery of pizza and toiletries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agnew, one of the Dream Defenders leaders, said he welcomed the physical challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be honest with you, I want to be able to say that we won this through perseverance,&quot; Agnew said. &quot;If you come in here and there are a bunch of air mattresses, it kind takes a little bit away from that experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing worth having is easy,&quot; he added. &quot;When you live it, it becomes a lot more real. We're just determined. Why give up? What do we have to go back to?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keeping an eye on children's safety at day cares</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While troubling to read, the article &quot;Day care evades the law&quot; (July 15) on the city's closing of a state-licensed child care center plagued by safety and financial problems offered insights into ways we can better protect our children in child care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Families, professionals, state and local officials are all part of the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; that keep child care programs healthy and safe places for our kids. By observing and listening and communicating with each other, we help ensure that safety standards are in place every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coordinated and reasonable enforcement of sensible regulations for child care programs should be in place - requirements that do not duplicate or conflict with each other, as state and local codes sometimes do. Instead, requirements should form a cohesive set of standards that safeguard children's well-being and are feasible for programs to maintain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many child care programs abide by rules governing payments and safety but don't make headlines, and some families are fortunate to have access to these programs. Regrettably, too many families do not: The reality is that many working parents still struggle to find the program that matches their schedules, is within the family budget, meets their child's needs, and is available when the family needs it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten years ago, a similar story (&quot;Children sent home after official inspects day-care sites,&quot; 2003) raised the same issues when city inspectors closed down an unlicensed child care center due to unsafe conditions. This center claimed exemption from state regulations due to a loophole in the existing law allowing school-operated programs to claim exemption from state oversight without proper documentation on file. Because of the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; who reported the deplorable conditions and because communication was shared between local and state officials, legislation was passed bringing greater accountability to child care programs claiming exemption. This is a prime example of improved policies resulting from coordinated efforts to make child care better for kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can, and should, work together to bring about changes in accountability and resources that directly benefit children in care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pam Mitchell o St. Louis United 4 Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obamacare's critics understand its costs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post-Dispatch's editorial &quot;Last gasp&quot; (July 21) suggests that Republicans are opposed to the Affordable Care Act because they value the political capital they would gain from its failure more than supposedly lower health insurance costs and fewer sick people. If only it were that simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial cites a study that claims Obamacare's health exchanges will drive down costs in states such as New York by 50 percent. However, New York is an outlier - it already has laws on the books to require coverage of pre-existing conditions. Most states don't, so New York's costs will obviously fall when such coverage becomes mandatory under federal law and the pool of subscribers expands. But since New York's costs are currently 63 percent higher than the national average, even with the 50 percent decrease in prices, insurance there will still be more costly than in most places right now. Not to mention this decrease is paid for by Americans from across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If opposing Obamacare affords political capital, it's because a growing majority of Americans recognize that the costs of the program outweigh the benefits. Whether it's more expensive premiums for the young and healthy, lower quality care, or less consumer choice, there are plenty of legitimate reasons to oppose the ACA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austin Woods o University City</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rule of law must be independent from political interference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death and the subsequent acquittal of George Zimmerman, it seems many only respect court decisions when they agree with the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had O.J. Simpson been found guilty, the aftermath would not have been peaceful. Why didn't the Justice Department look into that decision?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our president missed a great opportunity when he chose to be black, when he is also white. What a unifying force he could have been: a biracial president!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the rule of law is not independent from political interference, we will eventually slip into anarchy. Race will be the least of our worries. A country divided against itself can not endure; we tried that once: the Civil War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William L. Frazier o Valley Park</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was stalked, attacked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the first thing we tell our children if they are being followed, stalked, or attacked by a stranger? We tell them to kick, scream, hit, fight, punch, hide, take short cuts home, call for help; anything to escape the stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had every right to be in his father's neighborhood - armed only with Skittles and ice tea. George Zimmerman was told to stand down and ignored the dispatcher. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin saw a stranger in a car following him, later following him on foot. This would frighten all of us. The horror of our children being attacked by a stranger is unbearable as a parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin acted in the only way he knew how. Protect yourself. For this Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is dead and George Zimmerman is free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malcolm Murphy o St. Peters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury did not consider Trayvon&nbsp;Martin to be a victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama said &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me&quot; (July 20). Well would &quot;me&quot; have refused to dialog with a neighborhood watch person and instead brutally attacked this person with intent to harm or even kill him? Would &quot;me,&quot; before that fatal incident, have been on suspension for drug possession? Would &quot;me&quot; have been suspended from high school several times for truancy, vandalism, etc.? Would &quot;me&quot; have used social media to spread a stream of violent rhetoric? If so then could &quot;me&quot; have been elected to higher office or become president of the United States? Should &quot;me&quot; be considered a victim regardless of my actions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the particular case of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a sworn jury when considering the facts did not think so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orville Burkemper o Des Peres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Floaters who don't respect property rights are frustrating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the editorial &quot;Stand Your Gravel Bar&quot; (July 24):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with the author that no one need have died in order to take a pee. But, as a property owner with land on the Meramec River, I can understand the frustration and anger that James Crocker has toward some floaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have property along the upper Meramec, with a very nice gravel bar and swimming area. We also maintain some camping area for friends to use, and that is inside the tree line, off the river. For the most part, river floaters are respectful of our property. However, we have found that large groups often are not respectful. When they leave the river, and go up into our camping area, they do not respect private property. If they use the outhouse we built, this is not a problem for us, but they will often leave trash behind, toilet paper on the ground or destroy parts of the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larger groups seem to be the ones most intoxicated, leaving behind trash on the gravel bar. Several times, when we were swimming, the men exposed themselves to our children, or went to the gravel bar to pee near our chairs and coolers. Since exposing yourself to a child is illegal in a city, why do they seem to feel this is appropriate on the river? These people have even given alcohol, in the form of Jell-O shots, to my children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have learned that we must avoid our swimming hole until after 3 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays, because most of the groups have passed our place by then. We are afraid to go to our own part of the river because of the confrontations we've had with these groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Crocker's situation, he found a group of more than 40 people stopping at this gravel bar. Some of the men ignored his private property/no trespassing signs and left the gravel bar to go pee and defecate on Mr. Crocker's land. When he told them to return to the river, they refused. The argument increased to threats at that point. This confrontation did not have to result in a death. The floaters should have respected the landowner's signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If floaters just respect the private property along our rivers, we could all enjoy them in safety, and avoid situations like this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene Hanneke o Ellisville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crestwood administration demeans citizens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, I was privileged to participate in an event that speaks to the core of our democracy. A large group of concerned citizens in Crestwood held a peaceful rally and prayed for progress at Crestwood mall. We were exercising our right of free assembly and free speech to express our frustration with the current city leaders and their lack of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the subsequent Board of Aldermen meeting, an overflow crowd expressed their views and the three-minute rule was invoked, as it very rarely is, but of course there were exceptions. During the meeting, the concerned citizens were subjected to condescending and uninformed elected officials. This happens in a community where due diligence is attacked and the current administration seeks to be the gatekeeper for all information and only lets those who support the lack of vision have access to all the data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For expressing their opinions, the plugged-in citizens were termed the &quot;peanut gallery,&quot; which demeaned them and their efforts. Enthusiastic applause was considered inappropriate by some, maybe those with no passion for a vibrant community. I hope the elected officials in my hometown realize there are steps the voters can take when they have no confidence in the current leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mimi Duncan o Crestwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be careful about accusing Schnucks of discrimination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the letter &quot;Neighborhood's Schnucks store is disappointing&quot; (July 22):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would be interested to know what percentage of sales at the Schnucks on Grand and Gravois comes from fresh produce. My guess is far less than at many of their other locations. I live within a few miles of this Schnucks and the Loughborough Schnucks. I shop at the Loughborough location because I know they carry more things that I purchase. But I am glad the Grand and Gravois location exists because we already have problems with &quot;food deserts&quot; in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I don't condone displaying poor quality merchandise, we should be careful about accusing Schnucks of discrimination for something which is more likely a question of what sells at these locations. They may decide that it's not worth it and close their stores in these neighborhoods making the food desert problem even worse. I shop at Schnucks partially because they do have stores in the city, even though I'm sure some of them are not as profitable due to higher costs, including higher produce waste costs, I would guess.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Produce clerks are responsible for keeping asparagus fresh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have read all the articles on the dried-out asparagus at the Schnucks store, and the letter about the poor standards of some of the other Schnucks stores. As a retired employee of Retail Clerks Local 655 - 10 years with Kroger and 20 years with Dierbergs - I had to voice my opinion on this subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, and most importantly, the produce department is the responsibility of the produce clerks. As a produce clerk, I took pride in my products that were on display and always made sure that my customers were happy. I can't imagine telling a customer that I was aware of the moldy onions and not taking them off the display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as the asparagus situation, we always removed the old water and replaced with fresh water everyday. If the produce or any other product in the store is bad, it is the responsibility of the department managers to make it right.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A realistic view of the real American tragedy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was shocked and pleased to see the Peter Bell commentary on black culture and the need to hold people to a higher standard (&quot;Blacks must also look inward, at our culture,&quot; June 25). This follows on Bill O'Reilly's commentary regarding the abhorrent situation with black-on-black crime. While we are all spinning on the George Zimmerman acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, the real tragedy is occurring in the black community, where families are disintegrating. Let's stop with the race-baiting and focus on what needs to be done.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell blames black criminal behavior on deeply dysfunctional homes and communities. Did these spring up out of a place where everyone had equal access, rights and privileges? Many of the children are full of stifled potential. Look a little deeper into hip-hop art and culture, Mr. Bell, and you will find many artists whose expressions do not denigrate women or themselves. Hip-hop art is largely an expression of the needs, desires and observations of a young, devalued, disenfranchised segment of our society. This segment has found validity for its creativity, energy and brilliance through its art. Open your heart, eyes and ears, and observe who these young people are that you so thoughtlessly denigrate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take more care when labeling racial motives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial citing outbreaks of violence in 1967 labeled Detroit's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a &quot;race riot&quot; (&quot;Why Minneapolis didn't follow Detroit,&quot; July 25). It wasn't a race riot. A race riot is an event in which members of different races attack each other. In Detroit, after police made arrests at an after-hours inner-city bar, some citizens rose up against what they saw as a pattern of police brutality toward black people, and widespread violence ensued. Police and National Guard troops responded en masse, and many black protesters acted self-destructively, setting fire to businesses and homes in their own neighborhoods. I spent five months in Detroit, in 1968 and '69, making a documentary film for national public television on the causes and effects of the outbreak. Most black people I interviewed called it a rebellion, and they adamantly rejected the idea that it was a race riot. They said the protesters were acting not against white people, but against the police. Using the term &quot;race riot&quot; gives a mistaken impression of what happened; it also contributes to white people's fear and can harden their resistance to working toward racial harmony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GARY GILSON, Minneapolis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial on Detroit hit much closer to the mark than the politically driven discussions occurring around the country. I'm a native of the greater Detroit area and can say that the 1967 riots did begin the process by which Detroit became a bankrupt wasteland. But there's something in the editorial that's relevant to the Twin Cities. People didn't just move outside of Detroit; they stopped going downtown altogether. While the greater Detroit area is still economically active and vital, little of that money finds its way into Detroit proper. No large city survives without such commerce. The Twin Cities, on the other hand, has active downtowns that people use to attend sports events and concerts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP members of Congress are not just playing hardball with President Obama - they're showing a reckless disregard for the well-being of the American public. When they slash the Environmental Protection Agency budget, it's the water we drink and the air we breathe that goes unprotected. When greenhouse gases go uncontrolled, it's our children who will pay the price. Cut the Securities and Exchange Commission budget, and people in finance can once again do whatever they can to rake in the profits so that the rest of us see the value of our pensions and homes plummet. Let's not ever lose sight of the fact that the only real losers in this game of hardball are us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has been said about recent unemployment changes. What seems to be missing the dialogue is that North Carolina had to borrow, and now owes over $2.5 billion plus interest to the federal unemployment insurance program.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These loans must be repaid, or federal allocations (further loans) for unemployment benefits will be reduced in future years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Bill 4, which seems to have so many people in an uproar has, by necessity had to reduce benefits. It has also increased the taxes that employers must pay to fund the unemployment insurance program, repay the debt and to regain program solvency. A study completed by an independent agency in May 2012 examined a number of options that could be followed to regain solvency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included was a comparison of the nine states of the southeast US. From that report: &quot;one anomaly stands out - maximum weekly benefit amount is over 70 percent higher than the average of the other eight states.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political pandering, ... does not reduce the debt reduced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may not like that people have had benefits reduced (mostly to bring it more in line with the rest of the southeast), but North Carolina has an obligation to repay the federal debt. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marching to Raleigh does not pay the bill. ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All types of racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman incident is a tragedy on several levels, not the least of which is the torrent of racial prejudices it has released. A sad example of this is our president's recent statement on the subject, and E.J. Dionne's column about his statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president, while trying to present his comments as even-handed, justified the uproar from the African-American community over the jury verdict, by saying that they were &quot;looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have heard no one comment on the equally valid justification for the position of the white community. They, too, are looking at this issue through their own &quot;set of experiences&quot; - namely, that young, black males are very disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system of violent crimes, and therefore ... are often viewed with suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is it noted by the African-American community that bad things happen to white people, too! Such events are viewed as examples of the unfairness of life. But when bad things happen to African-Americans, they are typically viewed as having been caused by the color of their skin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Big Brother is the Vegemite of reality TV: Either you love it, or you find it so noxious and distasteful it's impossible to comprehend that anyone else would willingly, let alone happily, ingest it. For the past 13 years - every single summer since 2000 and one ill-conceived February - a dozen-odd people have willingly isolated themselves for three months inside a floodlit Panopticon made to look like a home, their every move broadcast over all-day livestreams and condensed into three prime-time hours per week, all for a half-million-dollar prize. The participants on Big Brother are, of course, not &quot;here to make friends,&quot; and regularly engage in all sorts of scheming, manipulation and histrionics. On this show, when one player calls another a liar, another can safely reply, &quot;Yeah, I don't know what game you're playing, but I'm playing Big Brother.&quot; But this season, the show's 15th, some Big Brother contestants have plumbed a new nadir of atrocious behaviour: blatant racism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost as soon as this season began, close watchers of the various Web streams began to catalogue racial slurs, as well as homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic ones, that were not making it to air. CBS has historically sanitized the livestreams for prime time: Big Brother has a long history of contestants being racist - if not this racist - but CBS has previously claimed that such comments do &quot;not meet the network's standards&quot; and it would cut them out of the network airings, leaving them to the hawk-eyed thousands closely monitoring the livestreams. Not this time. In this summer when Paula Deen and Trayvon Martin are on front of mind, instead of ignoring its contestants' racism, Big Brother has made it one of the major storylines, giving audiences a front-row seat not just to the sort of hateful mindset and speech that usually occurs behind closed doors, but to the self-delusion of bigots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half the cast has, at this point, engaged in some kind of casual hate speech, but there are two major culprits. The first, Aaryn Gries - yes, her name really is an anagram for &quot;Aryan&quot; - is a blond-haired, blue-eyed, Texas-born carapace of pure vileness. Aaryn insists she is a &quot;good&quot; person. She has also put on an &quot;Asian voice&quot; to joke about getting her nails done; said that Helen, the only Asian-American on the cast, should &quot;go make some rice&quot;; and remarked that one should be careful in the dark around Candice, the only African-American woman on the cast, &quot;because you might not see the bitch.&quot; She has also taken issue with pediatric speech therapist Candice's pronunciation of the word &quot;asked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The derogatory language, which Aaryn and GinaMarie had previously used only in front of other white cast members - you know the saying, evil flourishes when less evil people do nothing because they are trying to win a game show - made it to prime time when Aaryn provoked a flabbergasting scene that caused the house to turn against her. (She's up for elimination this week; GinaMarie is not.) In a fit of pique, Aaryn flipped Candice's mattress off the bed for no reason. When Candice asked who had done that, Aaryn began to snake her head and taunt, &quot;What you gonna do, girl? Where's yo class, girl?&quot; GinaMarie, escalating, got in Candice's face and asked if she &quot;wanted the black to come out.&quot; (There's a class component at play here: GinaMarie's bigotry is classically white working-class, a reflexive xenophobia that's more out there but less frightening for it. Aaryn is genteel, racist but knowing enough to not get busted saying the N-word. Hers is the racism that usually knows how to hide.) The incident ended only when Howard, the other African-American in the house, carried Candice out of the room. Crying, Candice said to him, &quot;They have called me 'Sheniqua,' flipped my bed, and I am supposed to go into another room and hide?&quot; Howard implored her to keep her cool: &quot;This game doesn't care about what's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would think that only someone extraordinarily stupid would say these things in a house covered with cameras, where there is so little privacy that players change their underwear underneath a towel. But it's more insidious than that: Big Brother generally encourages bad behaviour, and these women seem to think that their behaviour is no worse than the standard slurring, scheming and gamesmanship that regularly goes down. Aaryn isn't hiding her true self, not simply because she is dumb, but because she is privileged and sheltered and doesn't think she's being that racist and she imagines that everyone watching at home will see it the same way. They won't: Aaryn and GinaMarie have both already been fired from their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the mattress incident, Candice came upon GinaMarie sobbing on the couch, with Aaryn comforting her. Candice, finding almost supernatural reserves of compassion, sat down and began to rub GinaMarie's back. Aaryn took the opportunity to apologize. &quot;Candice, I'm sorry,&quot; Aaryn said. &quot;Anybody that knows me knows that just because I'm Southern, and I say things that probably aren't appropriate all the time, I have nothing against any other race. And if I make a comment that seems like I do, I don't want it to be taken that way, and I don't want to offend you.&quot; This is the kind of thing, distasteful as reality shows can sometimes be, that would be almost impossible to plausibly fictionalize, even though it is a fact of life all over America. The racist who believes she has nothing against any other race, who apologizes largely because it is strategically sound while still thinking of herself as an open-minded person, who is a cruel bully until she becomes self-pitying and defensive, is almost too ridiculously grotesque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Brother has congratulated itself a bit for putting all of this on air: When Julie Chen, the host, spoke about it on her talk show The Talk, her co-host Sara Gilbert said, &quot;I'm happy that CBS and Big Brother aired the comments, because I feel like it's good for people to see it, and let these people deal with the consequences when they get out of the house.&quot; But Big Brother plays a part in all of this, even if it was just giving Aaryn the rope with which to hang herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a larger issue, which is how the show is cast: GinaMarie described Candice and Howard as &quot;tokens,&quot; a nasty thing to say that also, if you look over the past casts of Big Brother, appears to be true.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CUTLINES A protester wears bullet keychain on a lanyard and a T-shirt with an image of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin during a demonstration in Los Angeles after the acquittal of George Zimmerman. Jae C. Hong/ Associated Press - In the days week since the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the responses to the tragic event, the trial and the verdict have been predictable. That an unarmed youth lost his life and the perpetrator of the act walked free catalyzed angry and sometimes violent street protests. However unfortunate, that is hardly surprising.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal nuances of second-degree murder, manslaughter, evidentiary rules and jurors' decisions don't often penetrate through the fog of the 24/7 news cycle. Many people inevitably respond to headlines and passion. There also have been some reasonable discussions of the propriety and impact of &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws and whether Florida's played a role in the verdict. What isn't reasonable or appropriate is the hysterical response of some civil rights leaders and advocates who have peddled a dishonest and hyperbolic analysis of the tragedy. Unfortunately, their message has been repeated ad nauseam and has become the settled wisdom for some: Young black males are at physical risk in this country, and it is the bigotry of whites that has put a target on their backs. Jesse Jackson said last year that blacks were &quot;under attack. Targeting, arresting, convicting blacks and ultimately killing us is big business.&quot; Last week he said, &quot;A wave of nameless fear is gripping our country.&quot; The musings of Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Al Sharpton echoing the same theme - America is a dangerous place for young black males - have been widely reported. Benjamin Jealous of the NAACP warned that black youth be advised on how to dress and talk, and talked of how hard it is to tell them to be &quot;timid about asserting&quot; their freedom. We received a newsletter from an African-American civil rights lawyer who wrote about walking into a convenience store on a recent Saturday night: &quot;Wow. All these people have heard the verdict. Do they now think that I am fair game? Will someone hurt me now that they know that Zimmerman walked?&quot; What is so insidious about this message of victimhood and division is its dishonesty. Despite the tragic death of Martin under circumstances that no one will ever know the true nature of, there is no &quot;big business&quot; of killing blacks in America. There is no wave of bigotry directed at blacks. All this talk is demagogic posturing, and it's dangerous. Young people will absorb this message and view the &quot;other&quot; with suspicion and fear. These leaders know, even if many of their adherents might not, that the biggest threat to the lives of young blacks is other young blacks, not white bigots. From 2000 to 2010, 4,607 black murder victims 17 or younger were killed by other blacks (4,441 of the killers were 17 or younger), according to the Wall Street Journal. There were 340 black victims 17 or younger killed by (non-Latino) whites. That means black youths were 13 times more likely to be killed by a black person than by a white one. The more recent data haven't changed much. In 2011, according to the FBI, 2,695 blacks (of all ages) were killed, and the killers were nearly 13 times more likely to be black as white (2,447 to 193). These data are no revelation (they have been constant for more than a decade), yet &quot;leaders&quot; and the far-too-complicit media purvey a notion that inter-group relations have plummeted and it's open season on blacks and other minorities. What is the reality? In January, Pew Research released a poll on group conflicts. It found that 58 percent of respondents see more disputes between rich and poor, and 55 percent see more between immigrants and native-born than see disputes between blacks and whites (39 percent). And in 2008, a Pew poll concluded that &quot;whites, blacks and Hispanics all have generally favorable opinions of one another and all tend to see inter-group relations in a more positive than negative light.&quot; &quot;The overall portrait of race relations is one of moderation, stability and modest progress.&quot; That says nothing about the 95 million millennials whose attitudes are far more tolerant than their elders on a whole range of issues relating to race. It is clear that the Sharptons and Jacksons have a vested interest in keeping tension alive. Their relevance, audiences and fundraising are contingent on there being a perception that racial barriers remain, that fears persist and that their role as firemen is needed. The biggest threats to their continued viability is tolerance and an acknowledgment that inter-group relations are improving, that there is no war on black youth and that the country that elected Barack Obama to the presidency twice isn't demonizing kids who look like the first family. We would all do well to spend our energies on issues that are real and the implications of the tragic Trayvon&nbsp;Martin death that make sense. David A. Lehrer and Joe R. Hicks are president and vice president, respectively, of Community Advocates Inc., a human relations organization. They wrote this for the Los Angeles Times.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Correction This story originally misspelled the author's name. The story has been corrected. CUTLINES reaction Lesley Rimmel: Apparently these men interpreted the (George Zimmerman) verdict as a green light to celebrate killing and racism . - Earlier this month, President Obama, reflecting on the trial of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin, spoke of how he had many times experienced fear and prejudice aimed at him whenever he was &quot;walking while black.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and many other Americans would be further dismayed to hear what some white Americans are saying when they believe only other whites can hear them. I recently witnessed a disturbing example of this in our area. On the evening of July 13, my companion and I had gone to Tulsa to see a show, &quot;Dhadkan,&quot; a charming celebration of world culture as revealed through music and dance from various parts of the globe. On the way back home to Stillwater, we stopped for gasoline at a filling station just west of Sand Springs, in a quiet area. I went inside the station and waited for my friend to come in to pay. Soon my friend entered. There were a lot of people - all of them apparently white - waiting to pay the cashier. Suddenly two young men started laughing loudly, and one said, &quot;Let's go down to the lake (presumably Keystone) and drown some n-----s.&quot; The other young man, also using the N-word, agreed and further embroidered on the idea. I was so taken aback that I froze in silence - where was I, in 1950s Alabama or Mississippi, or was this 1921 in Oklahoma? It was undoubtedly a good thing that I decided not to make this a teachable moment, as the two young men might have redirected their wish to commit violence at me. Whether they were serious or drunkenly joking was irrelevant. They had very publicly proclaimed their wishes. My friend and I quickly made our way to the door and out to the car. A middle-age man who had also been present at the scene then attempted to explain the two younger men's statements (with which he seemed to agree): Zimmerman had just been acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of Martin. Apparently these men interpreted the verdict as a green light to celebrate killing and racism. So this was how we received the news of the Zimmerman trial decision. We spent the rest of the ride home wondering how the shooting could not even rate a decision of manslaughter, or how such &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws could be overturned. We vowed not to go to Florida any time soon. But what haunted me most was what happened here in Oklahoma: two young men proudly expressing their glee at the sanctioned killing of a young African- American man. How many others in this country secretly share these feelings? And this case was not about racism? Lesley Rimmel is an associate professor of history at Oklahoma State University, where, among other courses, she teaches a seminar on the Holocaust. She lives in Stillwater.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA - Lawrence Fugett arrived here at the National Urban League's national convention with three things on his mind: networking, job tips and justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third item was new for the 35-year-old banker from Oklahoma City, but advocates say these are unusual times in the civil rights arena, and as a result, the three-day convention has been infused with a new sense of activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you look at everything that has been going on, it becomes clear we still need to fight for things,&quot; Fugett said. &quot;I came here to learn how to advance my career, but I'm inspired now to become more political.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 1910, the Urban League is the oldest community-based civil rights organization in the country. Over the years, however, the focus of its annual convention shifted from the civil rights struggle to a huge professional networking event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year seems different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The registration period for the conference was already open by the time the Supreme Court last month rescinded a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. As rsums were being polished for the conference's job fair, a Florida jury concluded that the killer of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could go home free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, the events became a call to action for many of the 6,000 in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sybrina Fulton was handing out an unusual kind of business card. The back featured a now-familiar photo - of her dead son, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, wearing a hoodie - that she distributed in the hope that people will fight to &quot;not let this happen to anybody else's child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No college for Trayvon. No grandkids coming from Trayvon,&quot; she told attendees. &quot;All because of a law, a law that has prevented the person who shot and killed my son to be held accountable and to pay for this awful crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers revised some events and invited new guests, including Fulton. Speakers were asked to focus less on the economy and more on equality. By the time Fugett sat down Thursday for an early-morning session, the theme of &quot;Jobs Rebuild America&quot; was an afterthought. An &quot;emergency town hall&quot; had been called to address voting rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know there may be anger, frustration and sadness as a result of the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. I know that many are upset about the effort to dismantle voting rights,&quot; Urban League President Marc Morial said, adding, &quot;We must not become cynical or lethargic in our quest for justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Attorney General Eric H. Holder announced Thursday at the convention that he was pushing for greater federal scrutiny for voting changes in Texas, he got a standing ovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, asked everyone in attendance to stand. She summed up the session's message simply: &quot;It's movement time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how such a movement will manifest itself has long been a salient question for civil rights organizations. As the harshest forms of racism receded in the United States and blacks made economic and social gains, many organizations such as the Urban League became more a draw for those interested in socializing with fellow professionals than a place for social activism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can get complacent and think we have arrived,&quot; said Emma Chappell, founder of the United Bank of Philadelphia and treasurer of Jesse L. Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign. &quot;Or we never take issues as seriously because we're out enjoying our lives. But now some things have become clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morial, the Urban League president, said that for years, many of the group's members were less interested in the kind of marches that had been so central to the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The August events honoring the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, for example, were originally planned as a commemorative tribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now, people see the greater need or urgency and want to participate,&quot; Morial said. &quot;There's something to march for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most interesting, he said, was the spirit of activism among young professionals at the convention. On Friday, during a panel presentation before a packed auditorium, Jackson and Al Sharpton stressed the importance of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keisha Robinson, 34, of McLean stood and asked a question. She wanted to know whether there was a broader vision than &quot;just marching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can we do more?&quot; she asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson interrupted another panelist to answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm concerned about those who are tired of marching who never marched,&quot; he said. &quot;I never did just march. Some of us never just marched. . . . We never lost a battle because we fought.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Robinson's question reflected her different reality. Never having faced the overt discrimination that afflicted their parents and grandparents, many young people in attendance saw the Urban League primarily as a vehicle for professional networking. Rather than sit-ins to desegregate lunch counters, they often just do lunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the luncheon for young professionals, placards on the dining tables grouped people by profession. A table for &quot;engineers,&quot; one for &quot;project managers,&quot; &quot;consultants,&quot; &quot;elected officials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brandi Richards, president of the league's young professional group, said the conference had a different air this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of us were impacted by the Zimmerman verdict,'' she said. &quot;It impacted us in a way that forced us to really understand our vulnerability and showed us the need for change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is not sure, however, whether this fervor will continue. The first big test will come next month, with anniversary celebration of the March on Washington. There, she said, they are prepared to stand in the sun and demand change, like earlier generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Keisha Robinson suggests, something more or different will be required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's an evolution to everything,&quot; Robinson said in an interview after Jackson's passionate retort. &quot;Sometimes you have to change strategies for the time. And these are new times.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I first heard their music at an off- campus party in the spring of 1993. It was a white party, one with very few, if any, other African Americans. I mention these facts for a reason. One I will revisit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sound, a mix of rock, blues, jazz, folk, classical, world and pure funk, woke me from my beer-soaked buzz. And that voice. It was raw and sexy, with a commanding range from falsetto to guttural baritone that left me awestruck. I was instantly obsessed and ran around the party asking the band's name. I was told it was some group out of Virginia and that its live shows were being taped and passed around at college campuses everywhere. I found the tape's owner and drilled him with questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name was the Dave Matthews Band. The group played lots of gigs around the University of Virginia because it was based in Charlottesville. The guy at the party told me a friend had sent him a tape of a performance. He said he wasn't sure whether the band would ever blow up, but he and his frat brothers liked it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So did I. In fact, the more I learned, the more I liked. Matthews, the lead singer, was a white guy from South Africa. The bassist, Stefan Lessard, was a prodigy who dropped out of school to do what he loved. And the majority of band members looked like me. Yet when I went to my first show a year later, I saw no one else in the crowd who did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I'm no stranger to being the only African American in the room. I attended predominantly white schools, had mostly white friends growing up and I've successfully straddled the worlds of black and white (Asian, Jewish, Indian, Latino and gay, too) my whole life, both out of necessity and because that's just the person I am. As a reporter for the past 17 years in Detroit, a city that's nearly 90 percent African American, I've met adults who are uncomfortable if they're not around their own kind. I couldn't imagine being that person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since that first show in 1994, I've been to roughly 40 more. I try to get to at least five shows a year, traveling mostly around the Midwest. (I can't make it to the show at Jiffy Lube Live in Bristow on Saturday, but I have already seen the band on four stops during its summer tour.) Over the years, I've been teased by some of my black friends who call DMB &quot;white-people music.&quot; At shows, some white people look at me as if I don't belong: &quot;Wow, you're really a fan?&quot; I've been asked while waiting hours in the fan-club line to get early access and a chance to run for the front row. I guess I don't look the part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True story: My friend and I were waiting in a lot after a show last year outside Cleveland when a white woman stumbled over and began talking to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was going to do something, but I stopped myself because I realized it was racist,&quot; she said, slurring her words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She explained how she was going to take a picture of us to prove to her co-workers that the Dave Matthews Band had African American fans. She said she worked with some black women who mocked her obsession with the band and who couldn't understand what she saw in the music. It was clear that she had to walk that line of working with people of different races, but she seemed to be frustrated by their stereotypes and assumptions about her life and priorities as a white woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understood better than most. I wasn't angry. I even told her she could take the picture if it was that important to her. Instead, I was just sad because this woman's drunken rant signified something larger for me. Why are we racially identified or judged by the music we like?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend who often joins me for concerts, despite saying, &quot;I hate Dave's voice&quot; every chance he gets, is African American. When he's with me, he counts the number of other blacks at the venue. In a crowd of 50,000, sometimes he makes it up to three or four. For him, it's kind of a validation that we really shouldn't be there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I want to be there, bringing the tally of black fans in the crowd to at least five. I'm not there to represent African Americans; I'm there to get my groove on and I'm comfortable enough with myself to know that I like the music I like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, I've been thinking a lot in the past few weeks about where, as a black woman, I am supposed to be. In his remarks a week ago, after the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial, President Obama talked in a personal way about race and his own experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He used his position to explain to folks something they truly can't understand unless they've been there. And I applaud him. The only criticism I have is that because he was talking about the death of Trayvon Martin, his message mostly was framed around the African American male experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, too, have been followed through stores like a thief in the night. I, too, have seen women clutch their purses or become uncomfortable on elevators. I've had to come to terms with the fact that for me to be a successful woman, I had no choice but to learn about other races - while other professionals have no requirement to learn about me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 20 years after I first saw the Dave Matthews Band in concert, I'm still the only &quot;chip in the cookie,&quot; or at least one of a few. But I embrace it. I have met so many incredible people while following this band - friends I now call family. I love the band and its music. I've met most of the members, and they are the kindest, most gracious people you could know. I interact with them on social media, and I try in different ways to let them know they appeal to people in all walks of life, or at least mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's funny is that although I've never met the band's namesake, I know he sees me out there. We often make eye contact at shows. And last December, after the encore at a concert in Philadelphia, he found me, a brown face in the sea of white ones, smiled and reached down from the stage and handed me his guitar pick.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the man who shot Trayvon still has to face God, says a juror</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI: The only non-white juror on the six-woman panel that acquitted US neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin says he ``got away with murder''. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a Good Morning America interview, to air on US network ABC today, the Puerto Rican said she could not find Mr Zimmerman guilty of murder under the law. ``You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,'' she said. ``We had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 36-year-old, identified as Juror B-29 during the trial and as Maddy in the interview, was selected for the trial five months after moving from Chicago. She said that after the controversial verdict she felt she owed an apology to the parents of Trayvon, who was shot dead in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, after buying lollies and iced tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``I felt like I let a lot of people down, and I'm thinking to myself, `Did I go the right way?' '' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she stressed that, based on the instructions the jury got from judge Deborah Nelson, she felt she couldn't convict. ``I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end,'' she said. ``But as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman admitted to shooting Trayvon, but insisted it was in self-defence after the teen wrestled him to the ground and pounded his head on the footpath. He had been following Trayvon on suspicion that the teen was involved in robberies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And, at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with,'' Maddy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An initial decision by Florida investigators not to press charges set off widespread protests, with Trayvon's supporters alleging racism, saying the teen was unarmed and had no criminal record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News in an interview made available Thursday that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favoured convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the sixmember, all-women jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&quot; she said. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighbourhood watch volunteer of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 slaying of the unarmed 17-year-old. The Miami teenager was shot and killed during a confrontation with Zimmerman in Sanford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she feels like she owes Martin's parents an apology.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read Sunday's article &quot;Tested by tragedy&quot; about how the Lafayette County Sheriff's Department is coping with the two triple homicides recently committed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can see how hard Sheriff Scott Pedley and his department are working. I know it is a thankless job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elected officials in Lafayette County and Madison should help them with more funding. I really think they need it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Dom Conforti, Beaver Dam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braun case is test of team, fan, management character</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you, Brewers owner Mark Attanasio, for being the voice of calm and reason amid the hysteria surrounding Ryan Braun's suspension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be a test of character for the team, the front office and the fans, but it is an opportunity to show the world what we are made of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, it does appear that the terms &quot;liar,&quot; &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;cheat&quot; may apply, but it has been a revelation to discover that we are surrounded by an incredibly high number of perfect people anxious to throw stones and express their hate for those of us who aren't so perfect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe they should put the stones down long enough to look in the mirror. That includes the sanctimonious Major League Baseball leaders who have bungled the whole performance-enhancing drug thing and continue to do so as the deals with the Biogenesis bottom-feeders are approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep the faith, Brewers fans. See you at Miller Park!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact of technology remains to be seen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My new smart phone is nearly so smart that it can turn me off and function by itself. It may come to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I miss the Luddites, or are they still around? They used to wreak havoc on technology because it was making human workers obsolete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We take the new technologies for granted, but it may take centuries to evaluate their impact on social relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what of those who choose to drop out in the meantime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Richard Kovac, Stevens Point</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was aggressor during deadly encounter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's sad that there was no law the jury could use in the George Zimmerman trial to address the aggressiveness he displayed by getting out of his vehicle to follow Trayvon Martin when he was advised not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman stalked Martin, took his life and tried to justify it by claiming self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When someone is tracking you down, you've got one of two options: flight or fight. Apparently Martin's first choice was flight. Otherwise Zimmerman wouldn't have had to hunt him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I'm being chased by another person and we get into an altercation, how am I the aggressor? The inconsistency of Zimmerman's stories implies that he may have been fabricating, and that he was the aggressor when confronting Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was just trying to protect himself from a pursuing stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Jeffrey L. Brooks, Madison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Badgers recruiting too many quarterbacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is recruiting for Badger football being run right or wrong? You decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in bringing on board all these quarterbacks, the coaches must not realize there are other starting positions on offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't the recruited quarterbacks coming in understand that only one of them is a starter, and there will be little or no playing time for the rest of them? How can they think they will have playing time in an overstocked position?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wonder what each recruit thinks after the spiel by the coach and the promises made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the rug is basically pulled out from under him when another quarterback - who the coach must think is more qualified - is recruited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone likes a winner, but not at these personnel costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Don Schoechert, Montello</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secure land for Madison bypass highway now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hurrah for your recent editorial, &quot;Beltline bypass needs serious look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former Wisconsin Department of Transportation engineer for highways, I have long supported planning for such a new highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existing Beltline needs upgrading, as is now being planned. However, the need for improved highway capacity does not end there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new outer highway from south of Verona, through the southern rural portion of Fitchburg, to a junction with the interstate highway east of McFarland would allow traffic the means to bypass the metropolitan area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would take a large number of heavy trucks, as well as other traffic with no Madison destination, off the existing Beltline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is already a need for this outer highway, but it is not realistic to expect it to be constructed for several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then why be concerned now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take a good look at the development and growth in Fitchburg over the last few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planning should be going on now to identify the location and land needed for the right of way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That way the corridor can be reserved before all the rural area is consumed by development.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a week after the verdict, a member of the jury that acquitted George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin - the first juror to show her face publicly - said she anguished over her not-guilty vote and that ultimately, Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only minority in the all-female jury, the juror known as B-29 said she struggled to balance the law against her heart, in her first public comments made in an exclusive interview with ABC airing Thursday and today. Though she followed the law and stands by her decision, she said feels she owes the parents of the Miami Gardens teenager an apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; said the woman, using only her first name, &quot;Maddy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy is the second juror to come forward, the first with her face shown, offering insight into how Zimmerman's fate was decided. He was acquitted July 13 after a five-week trial that provided the framework for a national discussion about race, profiling, self-defense laws and gun control. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watchman, fatally shot Martin in the chest during a violent struggle 17 months ago in a Sanford townhouse complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After almost three weeks of testimony, the jury - five whites, one Latina - deliberated for about 16 hours over two days. The jury was initially split: three for not guilty; two for manslaughter and Maddy, who first voted for second-degree murder, which carried the possibility of a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the second day, she realized there wasn't enough evidence to convict Zimmerman of murder or manslaughter under Florida laws - laws that she, like the other juror who went public, found confusing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end,&quot; she told Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts, later adding, &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin family attorney Ben Crump said Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, were aware of Maddy's comments and would likely issue a public statement today.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PITTSFIELD -- I'm tired of talking about race when it comes to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's out. No more from this corner, OK?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, let's take a look at what we're talking about now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We got this kid, 17 years old, 5-11, 158 pounds, a tall, skinny drink of water. He's walking around in a neighborhood where he doesn't seem to be known. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An adult, the member of the local neighborhood watch, spots him. The kid looks a little odd: Hoodie, jeans, slumping around on the street. Clearly not someone who lives there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adult calls the police. The police dispatcher tells him to stop following the kid. The cops will take care of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the adult says, &quot;Nah, I'm not going to let this one get away&quot; or words to that effect. Follows the kid in his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adult is armed. The kid clearly isn't. A confrontation ensues. Adult pulls out his piece, shoots the kid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That about sums it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble is, without a racial motive, you've got a guy shooting a 17-year-old kid because he doesn't like his looks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And don't give me this self-defense stuff. The kid's destination was his father's girlfriend's house. The adult's destination was clearly the kid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have to say, it sounds worse when you factor out race. Why? Because now it's anyone's son, grandson, nephew, little brother. And it could be anywhere, even in Berkshire County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be some 17-year-old walking down Crandall Street in Adams. Or some teenager walking up Castle Hill Avenue in Great Barrington. Some skinny, odd-looking young dude walking alone on Fairview Street in Lee. Some high school kid trying to look tough walking along Williams Street in Pittsfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And wherever they are, they get shot on one of those streets by somebody who lives there. A person whom the neighbors say was a nice guy, as far as we knew. Didn't know he carried a gun. Wonder why he didn't call the police?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think that's the basis of the frustration voiced by some of the people who have objected to George Zimmerman's not guilty verdict. They have put themselves in the place of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A guy shoots their son because he doesn't seem to fit in with the neighborhood. That wasn't a crime when I was growing up. When I heard about all this, I didn't see myself as a parent or uncle or big brother; I put myself in Martin's place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't wear a hoodie often growing up, but there were a lot of times when I felt I was a stranger in a strange land. I don't think that's a particularly unique situation. I think a lot of kids growing up in small towns feel that way. But it's no reason to get shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wonder what would have happened if Zimmerman had listened to that dispatcher? I'll bet he wonders, too. There wouldn't have been a fatal shooting, and there wouldn't have been a trial and there wouldn't be all this outrage and anger and demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think, in a strictly legal sense, the jury probably acted correctly. My understanding is that self-defense, as it seems to be legally construed in Florida, allows for the use of deadly force -- even if the other person doesn't have it. That sounds illogical, but I think it's a function of legislators trying way too hard to draft laws that will protect citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I talked to some gun owners I know in Berkshire County and none of them could envision a situation where they would follow and shoot an unarmed kid during a struggle. Obviously, I didn't talk to every gun owner in the Berkshires. And obviously, the guys I know who have guns are pretty responsible people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So maybe there are some folks out there who think this whole thing was OK. I doubt very much that reading this is going to change their minds. But I knew that. The great philosopher, Frank Zappa, once said, &quot;People will agree with you only if they already agree with you. You do not change people's minds.&quot; Frank knew his stuff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 26--Sitting behind the podium of a Florida courtroom, Richard Mantei commanded the stage with the same dramatic prowess as a professional thespian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tilted his head closer to the jury, raised his eyebrows in an expression of mockery, and craftily paced his speech with the poise of someone who has navigated the judicial system for 18 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are two people involved here: One of them is dead and one of them is a liar,&quot; Mr. Mantei said earlier this month, concluding his rebuttal of a motion to acquit the most well-known defendant that he had ever prosecuted in his lengthy career. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a few feet away, sitting on a bench at the Seminole County Courthouse, was George Zimmerman, the man who had been charged in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mantei, 42, an assistant state attorney in Florida who is formerly of Monroe County in southeast Michigan, was appointed to the prosecution team representing the state of Florida in the case that ended with Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal, triggering a public uproar over racial justice, gun regulations, and self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr. Mantei, the trial that has captured the attention of the nation is just the pinnacle of an illustrious career that began with a realization that he had as an undergraduate at the University of Toledo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Toledo in 1970, Mr. Mantei was raised in Ida, Mich., and graduated in 1988 from the former Monroe Catholic Central school. He then entered college with the intention of studying pharmacy. It wasn't until the end of his freshman year that he decided to leave microscopes and petri dishes behind. He never really had an &quot;a-ha&quot; moment, but he slowly found himself drawn to &quot;more reading-oriented and debate-oriented&quot; courses, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He eventually opted to pursue a dual degree in political science and philosophy, hoping to enter law school after graduation -- a choice that did not surprise his parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never understood why he wanted to go into pharmacy in the first place,&quot; said his father, Frank Mantei, 69, a retired Ida High School chemistry teacher who lives in Monroe. &quot;From a very young age, he was always verbally combative and had a phenomenal memory; he always liked big arguments and big discussions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oldest of four sons, Mr. Mantei used his rhetorical superiority to &quot;get [his younger siblings] out of trouble,&quot; his brother, Jeremy, recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For Richard to end up where he is today, it's no surprise. He was always intellectually astute, even as a kid,&quot; his brother said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, Mr. Mantei moved to Ann Arbor to study at the University of Michigan Law School and completed his studies three years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After practicing law in Akron, he moved to Jacksonville in 1997, where he has been serving as an assistant state attorney for the 4th Judicial Circuit Court since October, 2000. He is the director of the Special Prosecution Unit, which handles public corruption cases, white-collar crimes, and other complex litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have prosecuted everything from police officers to capital murders,&quot; Mr. Mantei told The Blade after the Zimmerman trial was resolved, noting that prosecutors need to have &quot;a good heart and tough skin&quot; to fulfill their duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a prosecutor, you have to make tough decisions and most of your decisions are going to make somebody unhappy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's another quality that has helped the attorney in his career -- his father calls it &quot;a sense of the dramatic,&quot; a talent that Mr. Mantei discovered when he was a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fifth grade, Mr. Mantei said he took the stage in an elementary school production of A Christmas Carol, playing the role of Tiny Tim in the popular novella by Charles Dickens. Later, Mr. Mantei honed his acting skills by performing in several musicals for his high school's drama club -- an experience that well prepared him to enter the world of legal litigation and trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mantei's name rose to prominence in numerous high-profile murder cases. For instance, in February, 2011, he was the prosecutor in a trial against Alexandra Tobias, a mother who was sentenced to 50 years in prison for shaking her baby to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was only during the Zimmerman trial that Mr. Mantei delivered his first nationally televised performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mantei and his three colleagues -- special prosecutor Angela Corey, lead prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda, and John Guy -- portrayed Mr. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, as a &quot;wannabe cop&quot; who wrongly profiled an unarmed 17-year-old African-American as a criminal, followed him with a gun, and shot him in a gated community in Sanford, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Richard never said anything, but I could tell from the tone of his voice on the phone that he was under a lot of pressure,&quot; Mr. Mantei's father said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three weeks of testimony and heated debate, the trial ended on July 13 with a jury of six women acquitting Mr. Zimmerman of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mantei declined to comment further on the verdict, citing personal concerns for his loved ones. But at a news conference following the jury's decision, he spoke respectfully of the family of the dead teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appreciate the way that they have handled this matter,&quot; Mr. Mantei said. &quot;They have been dignified, they have shown class, they have kept their pain in check when they needed to, they have grieved when they needed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr. Zimmerman's acquittal, Mr. Mantei is transitioning back into his life in Jacksonville, where he lives with his wife and two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially moving to Florida, he admitted, was a difficult decision as he &quot;didn't know a soul down there;&quot; but, he tries to visit his hometown in Michigan as often as possible -- or, at least, whenever he is not performing within the wood-paneled walls of a Florida courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I try to go back every now and then: Michigan is a really wonderful place, and it will always be home to me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hints of Mandela style seen in Obama approach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US PRESIDENT Barack Obama often cites Nelson Mandela for inspiring his own political career and whose approach to leadership he most admires and seeks to emulate, admiration he reiterated in his birthday greetings to Mandela last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hints of the Mandela style were evident throughout Obama's dramatic press briefing the next day, when he spoke about the trial of George Zimmerman for the killing in Florida of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. Obama highlighted lingering racial divisions and fears that have plagued the US since its founding, while suggesting ways for finally dealing with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historians may someday see this as a high point of Obama's presidency, but it is surely not as critical to national survival as Mandela's response to the 1993 killing of Chris Hani. Both leaders, however, deftly challenged racial stereotypes: Mandela by pointing out it was an Afrikaner woman who alerted police to the white perpetrator; Obama by asking if Martin was of age and armed, would he be entitled under Florida law to shoot the stalker, Zimmerman, in self-defence? Both leaders act in the belief that no one is above the law and, however unjust the result of a particular case, due process must prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complex and sometimes deadly issues of racial profiling, aggressive discrimination in policing and punishment, and the social alienation and economic marginalisation of young black men, was not as pressing a problem for Mandela as it is for Obama and presidents Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma. Despite the obvious differences between members of a disadvantaged racial majority in SA and a minority in the US, there are similarities in the challenges facing young black men. US journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault last week recalled how, in 1961, a friend once helped Mandela avoid a fate similar to Martin's, saying that what happened in Florida is more typical of the plight of young black men in today's SA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama personalised the problem by pointing out he looked liked Martin 35 years ago and, although not a victim of violence, he recalls enduring acts of racial profiling and indications of indiscriminate white fears that hurt him - these are still familiar in predominantly white suburbs of SA. When he later quoted Martin Luther King's call for judging people by the content of their character rather than the colour of their skin, however, this was also an implicit reminder that Obama, like the next generation of SA's leaders, is a &amp; born-free&amp; The challenges he is addressing have deep historical roots, as do those facing SA's leaders, but they also require different approaches than confronting the historical legal barriers of Jim Crow segregation and apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama attempted to provide a framework for addressing present challenges, which might resonate with present and future leaders in SA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional issues are no longer at stake in either country and Obama rightly focuses first on implementation at the state (provincial) and local levels. The scale of the need and lack of institutional capacity for improving security and the economic and social prospects of unemployed, unskilled young black men appear greater in SA, but the politics, resolve and financial constraints are also different and could allow for more innovation and, perhaps, success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both countries have too many guns and suffer rampant black-on-black violence. The ideological commitment to bear arms among the majority in the US is dissimilar to SA and, so far, Obama's attempts to reduce this danger have been thwarted. This is a struggle where the two countries could learn much from each other's experiences and experiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama is right to regard big national conversations as unproductive and instead calls for grass-roots efforts to build local support for local solutions, with the engagement of churches, civic groups, businesses and community authorities. This is not just glib talk but an acknowledgement of the importance of individual agency, rights and obligations. Here, too, Obama and Mandela are philosophically similar, although the younger man is much more attuned to the political tools of modern information and communication technology. Experiments in one community can be shared and tested in others more rapidly and effectively than ever before and the expenditure of promised public funds can be better monitored, provided leaders agree to greater transparency and accountability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEVELAND - Deep plea deal discussions hinging on the death penalty were underway for a man charged with kidnapping three women, keeping them cooped up in his run-down home and raping them repeatedly for about a decade, and a court hearing was scheduled today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides in the case against former school bus driver Ariel Castro are headed back to court this morning before a judge who wants to be kept updated on the talks, defense attorney Jaye Schlachet said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleveland TV stations reported Thursday that a plea offer had been made. Schlachet declined to comment on the status of the talks but said offers and counteroffers would be expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're in the middle of plea negotiating, that's where we're at,'' he said. &quot;Plea negotiations have been undertaken which, when there's plea offers and like any other negotiations, there's offers, there's negotiations, there's acceptance of offers, things of that sort.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's hearing was a &quot;final pretrial,'' Laura Creed, chief judicial staff attorney for the Cuyahoga County clerk of courts, said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty's office had nothing to add beyond Wednesday's mention in court of plea negotiations, spokesman Joe Frolik said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sticking point in the plea talks for Castro, whose trial is scheduled to begin Aug. 5, has been whether the prosecutor would rule out the death penalty as demanded by the defense. The prosecutor has that issue under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 977-count indictment charges Castro with two counts of aggravated murder related to accusations he punched and starved one of the women until she miscarried. Castro, who has pleaded not guilty, also is charged with hundreds of counts of kidnapping and rape, plus assault and other crimes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God,'' she said. &quot;And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 42 die in Iraq violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD - Emboldened militants in Iraq set up their own checkpoint to kill drivers and bombed crowded cafes Thursday in the deadliest of a series of attacks that killed at least 42 people, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 550 people have been killed in violent attacks so far this month, according to an Associated Press count, as violence continues during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The speaker of Iraqi parliament even has acknowledged that insecurity in the nation likely will get worse after a massive al-Qaida-claimed prison break freed hundreds of inmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadliest attack Thursday happened when a bomb exploded inside a crowded cafe north of Baghdad, killing 16 diners and wounded 20 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraqi police said that the blast targeted Noufel cafe near the town of Muqdadiyah, about 90 kilometers (60 miles) north of Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. scales down drone program in Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISLAMABAD - The United States has drastically scaled back the number of drone attacks against militants in Pakistan and limited strikes to high-value targets in response to growing criticism of the program in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those actions appear to have temporarily appeased Pakistan's powerful generals, who publicly oppose the covert CIA strikes, U.S. officials said. But some officials are still worried about pushback from Pakistan's new civilian leaders, who took power in June with a strong stance on ending the attacks altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future of the drone program is likely to be a key item on the agenda during U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's visit to Pakistan, which is expected soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 16 drone strikes have taken place in Pakistan so far this year, compared with a peak of 122 in 2010, 73 in 2011 and 48 in 2012, according to the New America Foundation, a U.S.-based think tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CIA has been instructed to be more cautious with its attacks, limiting them to high-value targets and dropping the practice of so-called &quot;signature strikes'' - hitting larger groups of suspected militants based purely on their behavior, such as being armed and meeting with known militants, said a current U.S. intelligence official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the associated press</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIGH POINT, N.C. - The North Carolina-based home furnishings company that markets Paula Deen's furniture line is sticking with the embattled celebrity chef. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Point Enterprise reports that Universal Furniture International will continue to market the Paula Deen Home Collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deen has been under fire since the revelation earlier this year of a legal deposition in which Deen admitted under oath to having used the N-word. Many companies have dropped Deen since the deposition became public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Scheffer with Universal Furniture says he feels bad for Deen. He says the Deen he knows isn't the one who has been portrayed in the media recently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLUMBUS, Ohio - An Ohio firearms group has raised more than $12,000 to buy guns or a security system for George Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch volunteer who was recently acquitted of all charges in the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Hanson of the Buckeye Firearms Foundation says the group sent Zimmerman a check for $12,150.37 Tuesday. He says the fundraising effort was launched because the group believes Zimmerman's gun rights are being violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Department of Justice has taken all the evidence from the trial, including the gun that killed Martin, as part of a civil rights investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attorney for Zimmerman has said his client is getting threats since the verdict earlier this month and has been carrying a weapon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA, Fla. - Firefighters in Florida are working with CSX Transportation officials to upright 10 toppled train cars that derailed at the Port of Tampa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSX spokesman Gary Sease told the Tampa Bay Times about 4,500 gallons of ethanol spilled onto the ground when the 81-car train derailed early Thursday. No one was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sease says the ethanol was contained to the immediate area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials say the train was heading to the port from Chicago. The cause of the derailment was not immediately known. CSX officials are investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities restricted access to the port while Tampa Fire Rescue crews sprayed foam onto the spill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prison population</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down for third year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The government says the U.S. prison population dropped for the third straight year in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bureau of Justice Statistics says there were more than 1.5 million prison inmates last year. That's a drop of 1.7 percent from 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prison population hit a high of more than 1.6 million inmates in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the overall decline, the federal prison population actually rose by nearly 1,500 inmates last year. The state population dropped by nearly 30,000 inmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California is responsible for most of the decrease in the number of state inmates. That's because of a 2011 law sending non-serious, non-violent or non-sex offenders to county jails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine states saw their prison populations drop by more than 1,000 - California, Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, Arkansas, New York, Florida, Virginia and Maryland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-President Obama's remarks regarding Trayvon Martin on July 19 were totally out of line. He is speaking against the rule of law. It was decided legally in a court and with a jury and should be upheld. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I just read where Joe Manchin is going to be the guest of honor at $1,000-a-plate fundraiser hosted by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg has already spent $12 million to get gun haters into office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Is this the case that will set off Charles Manson's &quot;Helter-skelter&quot; scenario where blacks and whites fight a war against each other? I hope not. Turn off your hate and criticism and lack of trust and turn your eyes upon Jesus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The Rev. Archie Snedeger is a caring, loving, good and dedicated Christian serving God. To the sanctimonious person looking to criticize him, shame on you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-After watching the show &quot;Honey Boo-Boo&quot; I have to say it really isn't all that bad. At least they aren't hooked on meth and they actually do have a couple of values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I lock my car door whenever any man I don't know walks by, white or black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The PSC should tell the electric company they can buy the John Amos Plant and the Mitchell facility, but they can in no way pass the cost on to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-We cannot afford to bail out Detroit, so forget it Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I live in the Davis Creek area. I put my dog out on a leash and walked back into the house. Within one minute a coyote had killed it. Don't turn your back. Keep your animals inside or watch them carefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-It is too easy to obtain a license to become a psychologist or psychiatrist. These people are dealing with fragile minds and can cause irreparable damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Our neighbor caught you on video as your big white dog did its doo-doo in our yard and we are tired of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Some landlords in Charleston between Hunt Avenue and Stockton Street have disgusting-looking property. It ruins the value of other property and Danny Jones and city council should do something about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-I agree that school shouldn't start so early. The teachers should have their meeting days during the summer. What about tourism? What about the state fair? What about all activities all over the state?</SPAN></P>

So I read the E-R's letters to the editor. Having said that, I am writing this letter to let everyone know that your president, uh, made a boo-boo (really) on TV when he went into the press room to give his &quot;racist&quot; opinion of what happened at the very televised trial of George Zimmerman and the state of Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the president said on television a few days ago, approximately July 19, about him as he relates to Trayvon Martin as both are black men. He has a habit of making most of his speeches all about him and he did not fail us by doing so in that speech. I will try to quote him as he said, &quot;Trayvon Martin could have been me   35 years ago.&quot; Well, if that were the case, Trayvon would have lived in Hawaii, loved by his grandparents (white) and given the best education in a private school, and all they could do to provide for their grandson. However, I think what he meant to say (I hope) was: &quot;I could have been Trayvon   35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He surely did not want to be someone else, me thinks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The VH1 Do Something Awards celebrate generally unknown good Samaritans, in addition to five celebrities making a difference. The show airs live from the Avalon in Hollywood Wednesday, July 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to first celebrate these amazing young people who are making a change in their community and celebrate for a night, to make them celebrities for a night,&quot; says Naomi Hirabayashi, chief marketing officer for the Manhattan-based nonprofit. &quot;And the second thing is to honor those celebrity honorees also using their voice for good.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entertainers being honored are Jennifer Hudson, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Patrick Dempsey, Kelly Osbourne and LL Cool J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chicago native Hudson and her sister, Julia, founded Hatch Day in honor of Hudson's slain nephew, Julian King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He always wanted to hatch things,&quot; Hudson says. &quot;He got it from a cartoon. It was something I wanted, a hatch day. He would say, 'Today is my hatch day.' This is our way of giving our hatch day and being able to help other kids through his memory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization collects and distributes school supplies and Christmas presents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where we came from, a lot of kids don't have school supplies or school clothes,&quot; she says. &quot;Children should not have to worry about those things. When we went (shopping), you got two pairs of shoes and two pairs of clothes, and we were considered blessed. We make sure these kids have school supplies and (presents) for the holidays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hudson was raised to help others. She already has her son, who's about to turn 3, help distribute Christmas presents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is so important and so crucial,&quot; Hudson says of teaching kids to volunteer. &quot;It builds your character and gives you good traits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson, a star of the hit sitcom &quot;Modern Family,&quot; is being honored for Tie the Knot, which he and his fiance, Justin Mikita, founded. Ferguson championed gay rights, and proceeds from Tie the Knot, a line of bow ties, go to LGBT organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson had watched the awards show, once known as the Brick Awards, before, when it debuted on The CW seven years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is supposed to be lighthearted and fashionable in such a lovely way,&quot; he says. &quot;And with Prop 8 overturned, it is very timely for us, and that Do Something wants to recognize our hard work is above and beyond. We never expected that to get attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Do Something organization has, over six years, collected 3.5 million pairs of jeans to give to homeless youth. &quot;It is the largest organization for young people for social change,&quot; Hirabayashi says. The campaigns cited by the awards touch people around the world. The honorees: Sasha Fisher of New York founded Spark MicroGrants, which provides grants to communities in Rwanda and Uganda for schools and wells. Daniel Maree, also of New York, created the Million Hoodies Movement for Justice in response to the killing of Trayvon Martin. Jillian Mourning of Charlotte, N.C., began All We Want is LOVE (Liberation of Victims Everywhere) to educate the public about sex trafficking in the U.S. Lorella Praeli of New Haven, Conn., works with United We Dream, which champions fair treatment of immigrant youth and families. Ben Simon of Takoma Park, Md., began the Food Recovery Network, which relies on college students to collect leftover food from dining halls and donate it to soup kitchens and shelters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so inspired when I watch and I look at these kids with drive and creativity,&quot; Ferguson says. &quot;... And that some of them are so young it inspires me and lights a fire under me and for the older generation to become more active in society.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case shows the incredible folly of the stand-your-ground and right-to-carry laws in Florida and many other states, but thankfully not in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the Martin-Zimmerman confrontation took place without witnesses, only George Zimmerman's testimony survived, and he was within his legal rights to &quot;stand his ground,&quot; according to Florida law. Thus, reasonable doubt about his guilt existed, so the jury had to acquit, and any other fair jury would have had to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This scenario may very well be repeated many times, in many states: All it takes is a physical confrontation without witnesses, at least one of whom is armed. We will never be able to eliminate physical confrontations, but we must try to minimize the possibility of deaths because of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rioters protesting the Zimmerman verdict would have been much better served by demonstrating against these Wild West stand-your-ground and right-to-carry laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Zanker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concord</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman acquittal was jury's only option</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither facts in evidence nor applicable law supported a murder two or manslaughter indictment, let alone conviction, of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was properly acquitted, despite tax-funded Justice Department agitators who traveled to Florida to inflame local sentiment against him, and despite attempted withholding of evidence by Florida State Attorney Angela Corey (including Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's incriminating text messages -- e.g., his self-identification as a &quot;gangsta&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors and a Martin family attorney themselves said the case wasn't about race. But that didn't keep race-baiting opportunists, from President Barack Obama to Attorney General Holder to the Rev. Al Sharpton, from stirring racial tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember the riots after O.J. Simpson's criminal trial acquittal? I don't either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Booker T. Washington, the famous black author/orator who was born a slave, wrote in 1911: &quot;There is a certain class of race-problem solvers who don't want the patient to get well, because as long as the disease holds out they have not only an easy means of making a living, but also an easy medium through which to make themselves prominent before the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's law is to blame for moral outrage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, I thought the acquittal of George Zimmerman was a moral outrage and I viewed the verdict of the predominantly white jury as just another example of twisted &quot;Southern justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as I listened to the discussion that followed, it became apparent to me that the judge's pre-deliberation instructions to the jury left them no other option. I still consider the verdict a moral outrage, but it's Florida's law that enabled the decision I condemn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's stand-your-ground law wasn't used by the defense to justify the killing, but the implications of that law will certainly produce more Trayvon&nbsp;Martins in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's rash conduct on that fateful night was unnecessary and irresponsible and should be condemned by every honest American. If he had heeded the reasoned advice of the 911 dispatcher, his unfounded concern would have been peacefully resolved by the police.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors know facts, law, and protesters do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears to me the jurors in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case were not biased and that the outcome was not racially motivated. I wish the same could be said about the protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How interesting that they believe they have a better understanding of the facts and Florida law than the six jury members who decided the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While much of the nation's diverse population is working toward a colorblind society, those who disagree with the verdict seem to selectively pick and choose factors that support their biases and viewpoints. That's easy to do these days when the media do the same thing, and Internet chatter is based far more on emotion than on facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice based on equality and discrimination based on racial preferences are mutually exclusive. We can't have both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also can't have majority rule, which is the foundation of democracy, and federal investigations and rulings based on political pressure by special interests. Sadly, this nation is moving toward the latter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury ignored evidence, focused on wrong thing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think the jury understood the evidence that was presented to them. They were more focused on the stand-your-ground issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against the advice of the 911 dispatcher, George Zimmerman left his vehicle and confronted Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman testified that his weapon was in his waistband at his back. It is doubtful he could have reached the weapon with Martin straddling him. I believe Zimmerman had the gun in his hand and Martin tried to protect himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some on the right are making Zimmerman out to be the victim -- that he should get a medal and Martin got what he deserved. What sad excuses for humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While peaceful demonstrations are useful, to assure we have justice for all Americans I urge all to register and vote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jury followed law in Zimmerman case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury reached the proper conclusion in acquitting George Zimmerman. The evidence in the case was clear and the jury had only one option: to follow the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear Zimmerman failed to follow the advice of the police and followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin into the apartment complex. However, being followed did not give Martin the right to assault Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence was clear that Zimmerman suffered numerous injuries to his nose, lips and back of his head. These injuries were corroborated by witnesses, and forensic evidence showed Zimmerman was on his back, with Martin on top of him slamming his head into the sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stand-your-ground law in Florida requires that the evidence prove it wasn't self-defense. The jury did its job.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about Martin's right to stand ground?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is outrageous George Zimmerman was acquitted for killing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone keeps talking about the stand-your-ground law as one reason Zimmerman is free today. What I fail to hear is that Martin also was standing his ground, which I guess doesn't matter, according to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin is not here to defend himself. I bet if he were, the verdict would have been very different. No justice whatsoever in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe Zimmerman will definitely pay for his deeds by not being able to live a normal life. I hope it is miserable for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How very sad for Martin and his family. My heart and prayers go out to them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brentwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entire matter was a political stunt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter by a jury of six women (four of them mothers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This verdict was reached because the prosecution could not present any evidence that proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, based on the nonexistent evidence, the charges shouldn't have been brought. The entire matter was a political stunt by the Florida State Attorney Angela Corey in her attempt to enhance her ambition to run for higher office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the liberal media sees this as an opportunity to stir up racism and curry favor with minorities. They mask that Zimmerman is a minority by referring to him as a &quot;white&quot; Hispanic. Ridiculous? Of course. But since when has the liberal media been accused of fairness and accuracy when a crisis can be used to advance their cause of racial pandering?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing more deplorable in this matter is that President Barack Obama is trying to use the Zimmerman affair as a distraction from all the scandals that plague him and his administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ernest Hampson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pittsburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice certainly was not served</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am deeply disturbed by those who proclaim &quot;justice was served&quot; in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be a crime, beyond any reasonable doubt, for a man to take a loaded gun, ignore instructions from an emergency dispatcher, stalk an innocent teenager and kill him after a confrontation that, regardless of who swung first or who swung at all, was the result of the killer's aggressive behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But under Florida's stand-your-ground law, &quot;justice was served.&quot; While Florida may be the worst state, it's not alone. Some 20 states have passed similar laws after lobbying by the NRA and ALEC, and passed by tea party Republican legislatures. It is they who are guilty of murdering Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many more will die before these awful laws are taken off the books? In the meantime, the lessons are clear: If you are black and living in a stand-your-ground state, arm yourself, and when you feel threatened, shoot to kill. If you don't carry a gun, stay out of Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida gun law was part of problem in trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am not a lawyer but have been in a jury and learned that what jurors are told and hear is often different from what the newspapers and the public believes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add to that the problem of states like Florida that have recently passed laws making it more difficult to challenge a shooter who believes he is in danger and you are likely to get an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conceal carry laws add to the lethal nature of the encounter. Would George Zimmerman have been so aggressive chasing the teen if he didn't have the concealed gun? I think not. There might have been an altercation, but its unlikely anyone would have died so tragically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne Spanier </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alameda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider recent crime, not just Martin's race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman case all started because George Zimmerman decided that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin appeared suspicious -- but what characteristics define suspicious?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many spectators concluded that this was a racial issue, but what if this case had nothing to do with race? Martin was out late in a neighborhood that had suffered from recent break-ins, and was concealed in a dark hoodie. Is it possible that this was enough reason for Zimmerman to pursue Martin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back when I was in middle school, sometime after leaving 7-Eleven with a black hoodie on, I noticed a patrol vehicle seemed to be following me, until my ride picked me up. Was that vehicle more likely following me because of my race, or because it saw a person covered up in a dark hoodie?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of race is a valid argument in the Zimmerman case, but it's definitely not the only factor that should be considered. Ethnicity and clothing are just a few of many other crucial characteristics that help us decide whether or not someone can be regarded as suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan Yung</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fremont</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could not accept an acquittal in this case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmermann should not have been acquitted of the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only testimony Zimmermann provided in his defense was the video report he made with the Sanford PD after his arrest, so there was no chance to challenge any of the evidence he provided in that video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after watching new clips of his attorney's demonstration with the dummy showing how Trayvon was straddling him during the confrontation, I have to ask how he was able to reach, let alone draw and fire his weapon, that was in a holster on his back as he laid on his back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thought that the jury was leaning toward a verdict of manslaughter when they requested clarification of the judge's instruction -- a verdict that I could have accepted. But to have the verdict come back as not guilty was one that I cannot accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case should make it very clear that the Stand Your Ground laws now in effect in 23 states need to be re-examined, rewritten or declared unconstitutional nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do we know or how do we decide who was in the right when applying these laws? Didn't Trayvon&nbsp;Martin have the same right under this law as George Zimmermann?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morris Soublet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayward</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case should never have gone to trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course. There was never enough evidence to support conviction, and the case never should have been brought to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial happened because of political and special-interest group pressure. The news media greatly contributed to the hype and hysteria because they continued to show pictures of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin at age 12 -- young and innocent. Seeing a picture of him as a 12-year-old boy would naturally evoke public sympathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tell the truth, news media, and publish a picture of him at age 17. Perhaps then the public might think he could have been the aggressor in this tragic event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those people protesting, should they get into trouble, should hope and pray they receive a fair trial like George Zimmerman did.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mystery to why jury acquitted Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have had the privilege of being on several juries. No way should he have been acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution proved George Zimmerman was a liar and the killing didn't happen the way he said. He had to have shot Trayvon&nbsp;Martin while he was standing upright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had I been on the jury, it would have hung. I watched the whole trial just like the jurors did; I don't know how they acquitted him of, at least, manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brenda J. Phillips</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Played the race card from the beginning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Involuntary manslaughter should have been on the table, but second-degree murder was over the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense made a better argument than the prosecution. Right from the get-go, the mainstream media, the networks and President Barack Obama played the race card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC altered the 911 call, and the media called George Zimmerman a &quot;white Hispanic.&quot; I never heard that phrase before. I guess that makes Obama a &quot;white black man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I knew when Obama got elected that race would be an issue throughout his presidency. What bugs me is when the people of Oakland and Los Angeles protested the verdict and started destroying property. That gives them a bad name. They're not doing themselves any favors with the public when they protest that way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No way to prove that race had an impact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence brought to the court proved that George Zimmerman is not guilty of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evidence brought up by the defense has proved that Zimmerman is not guilty. Zimmerman, based on Florida law, has acted within reason of his rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this case racially charged? There is no evidence in the case proving that Zimmerman followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because he is African-American. Zimmerman only followed Martin on the basis he looked suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge also had ordered the jury to disregard race and focus on the facts as presented. This case had nothing to do with race at all and there is no way to prove race played a role in this outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our court system has prevailed using facts to decide the outcome of this case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case began in America over 200 years ago</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman case started well before George Zimmerman got out of his car to follow Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. It started more than 200 years ago, and today an African-American mother still needs to teach her son what to do if stopped by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of being black in America are very different from the facts of the Zimmerman trial. Following the trial testimony and applying the law -- and only the law -- not guilty on the basis of self-defense was a reasonable conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those are not the facts being demonstrated against in the streets. The facts behind the demonstrations are that a white man shot an unarmed black teenager and got away with it. The Zimmerman case simply gave the still-festering issue of racism an object to posit the anger and despair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's not vilify the trial participants. Rather, let's understand the problem we unfortunately still have in America and channel our passions into understanding what we still need to do.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wouldn't happen with white teen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not agree with the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a hate crime. Zimmerman showed no remorse for taking a human life. The fact is, if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had been a white teenager this whole thing would never have happened.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fremont</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No right to go on wild rampages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do agree with the jury's verdict in this case. The jury heard and weighed the evidence and didn't find George Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder. The prosecution didn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty. Therefore, since the jury came to this decision, it must be respected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That so many people didn't like the verdict doesn't give them the right to go on wild rampages and destroy businesses and downtowns, only to hurt hardworking citizens. It seems like just an excuse to cause malicious destruction. Oakland should have been prepared in advance for this, but leadership in that city is lacking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broken system that is racially slanted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-guilty verdict of George Zimmerman says that it is open season on blacks and the white judiciary system protects all whites. It is a broken system, always has been slanted toward protecting whites from justice. Justice is not blind; from the people of African descent, it has been perceived to be in favor of all whites.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin wasn't killed for being black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, he's been acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many columns and airtime hours has the Bay Area media dedicated to the murder of Peter Cukor, a white senior citizen, killed in Berkeley by a black prowler at about the same time -- as opposed to the columns and airtime hours dedicated to the bringing to justice of a black prowler, thousands of miles away?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or for that matter to the thousands of people killed in Oakland, mostly by blacks, during the past four decades. If the Oakland examples aren't enough, take Chicago where 1,000 people were killed just in the first six months of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was not killed because he was black, he was killed for assaulting a neighborhood watchman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I applaud the brave women of the jury who stood up to President Barack Obama's attempt to weigh in on the trial's outcome, to Eric Holder, and to all of the racists of color trying to intimidate them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progress requires a change in thinking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the sick mind set of George Zimmerman that sees all black men as inherently criminal that must be put on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That way of thinking must be challenged, if we are to make any progress on the deep-rooted racism that infects our nation. In the tragic and poisoned atmosphere of racism that still haunts this nation, the trial of Zimmerman for the murder of unarmed teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, somehow managed to turn a young black victim into a perpetrator and a perpetrator into a victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said of the slain teenager that &quot;could have been me 35 years ago.&quot; Certainly that reality gives the President the moral standing to conduct a national dialogue on race that is so sorely needed. This is a time for presidential leadership.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial is over, George Zimmerman was tried in court and found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get over it. Stop all the violence and riots. No one rioted when O.J. Simpson killed two people and was found not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When some one kills a black person every one gets up set but let two white people get killed by a black man there's on riot or violence in any city in the country. Enough already.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Byron Williams, contributing columnist &copy; 2013 Bay Area News Group</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">628 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undoubtedly, there will be those who will attempt to maneuver the George Zimmerman verdict into an opportunity to allow them to act as if they are the heir apparent to the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should that occur, the death of Trayvon Martin would be of little importance beyond an elongated news cycle that provided fodder for columnist, bloggers and talking heads when other events appeared wanting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What would it say that in the aftermath of the verdict that one of the few accomplishments would have been to merely offer ammunition for hooligans looking for a reason to justify their thinly veiled desires to destroy property, as was the case in Oakland?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the Zimmerman verdict has brought us to a moral precipice, where our progress as a nation depends on returning to the question raised by King in his final book, &quot;Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frustration and anger many feel on the heels of the Zimmerman verdict may in some ways mask what's at the epicenter of their rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rage can take many forms. It can be demonstrated by destroying property, but it can also be demonstrated by nonviolently shutting down a freeway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be a misnomer to conclude that those who participated in the civil rights movement were not motivated by rage. But the rage was galvanized into nonviolent direct action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the March on Washington, which next month will commemorate its 50th anniversary, was focused on economics and justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1941, A. Phillip Randolph proposed a march on Washington based largely on fair working opportunities for African-Americans. Though the march never came to fruition, the need that spurred Randolph did not dissipate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1963, the civil rights movement fighting for justice joined forces with Randolph's efforts, producing the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cyclical nature of history seems to have again offered a possibility of transformation for the country. Could we not conclude that the frustration many Americans feel is based on what they perceive as a lack of opportunity and a concern for justice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does that not potentially make the Occupy Wall Street movement and those concerned about the larger implications of the Zimmerman verdict natural allies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If such a movement were to occur, it cannot be something that is given to the people by those already comfortably seated at the table of privilege; it must be something that is organically created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 1960-1968 there was a movement somewhere in the country challenging the status quo. While King was the most visible face, and his presence brought credibility and media attention, the majority of those movements were organized at the local level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sit-ins, freedom rides, Selma, Ala., Albany, Ga., Mississippi Democratic Party, Vietnam protests, and the sanitation workers strike in Memphis were not King-led movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the King question looms large nevertheless: Where do we go from here? Is it business as usual; is it chaos or community?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who desire change must bear in mind three prerequisites:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change and discomfort are correlatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change must begin as the minority opinion, at least as it relates to the dominate culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary beneficiaries of the stated change must also be the main artisans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an added burden that change must transform the present ethos. Civil rights was not viewed as a pressing issue in 1963, until the nation saw the brutality of the police dogs and fire hoses turned on children, and witnessed King's response several months later in his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like 1963, this is a moment ripe for change. Will it be seized proactively or will it languish in reactionary doldrums?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- Deb Silberberg came to Fern Street Friday morning to honor a slain neighbor and glean information on what city and police leaders plan to do following the slaying of a 66-year-old animal rescue crusader who was shot dead while driving her Subaru Outback in the Fairfax district Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the end of the news conference, Silberberg was angry and frustrated with a lack of answers and information about the killing of Judy Salamon and city crime-fighting plans, in general. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We walk the walk and talk the talk. We take care of Oakland, and they are not taking care of us. I want more police officers. I would like to see that my tax dollars don't go in the Dumpster for Occupy Oakland,&quot; said Silberberg, a homeowner in the Melrose district who is considering leaving Oakland because of continued, and often random, violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's not alone. An urgent private patrol information session is slated for Saturday at 10 a.m. at Maxwell Park and a meet-your-neighbors community dog walk was planned for Friday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday morning's event was organized by Maxwell Park district City Councilwoman Libby Schaaf and Councilman Noel Gallo, chair of the public safety committee. Mayor Jean Quan and Oakland police brass did not attend because they were planning for possible Occupy Oakland protests downtown Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where are the police, where's the mayor?&quot; people yelled as Gallo spoke about reporting suspicious activity to police and keeping an eye out for one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salamon was working as a dog walker Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. and was driving with a dog in her car when she was killed. The dog was not injured. Police have not confirmed reports that she was hit by a stray bullet in a gun battle. The homicide was the 56th of the year in Oakland, and remains unsolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quan spokesman Sean Maher said he and another mayor's office representative attended the Friday gather in place of the mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor wanted to hear what the community had to say and that is why she sent (two representatives), despite the late notice we got about the (news conference),'' said Maher, adding that Occupy Oakland organizers put out notice that there could be a &quot;city shut down&quot; in honor of Trayvon Martin anywhere from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday. &quot;We want to make sure we don't have any have any of the vandalism we had after the (George) Zimmerman verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallo, however, said it's at least partially up to the people to take charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can no longer hide behind those bars and windows, we have to take action,&quot; Gallo said. &quot;What I'm asking is for neighbors to come forth, get mad, take action and take ownership of your neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, is exactly what Salamon did -- for people and animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was really a tireless and persistent advocate for animal welfare,&quot; said Joel Denney, who had known her since she moved to the neighborhood 20 years ago. &quot;She was also a tireless advocate for justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside of her love for animals, Salamon was a dancer, and an lover of literature, and had competed all but her dissertation toward a Ph.D in comparative literature from the University of Toronto, said her friend Eric Sahlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She came to the Bay Area from Canada about 30 years ago as the wife of a UC Berkeley professor, but the two later divorced, Sahlin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salamon had no children, and her only close relative, an older sister in Southern California was grieving Friday and declined an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But plenty of people remembered Salamon fondly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denney said when she cared for his cats she would nap with the critters on her if she felt they were upset or missing their owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the kind of person she was, she just went extra step after step. Always taking it upon herself,&quot; Denney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the last things she was doing was trying to find homes for two litters of bunnies, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while remembering his friend, he said he feared the cycle of violence isn't going to end anytime soon. &quot;What we have here is a sociopath culture going on here,&quot; Denney said. &quot;I don't know how you break that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Solomon and Alaysha Carradine, an 8-year-old aspiring model, were killed in the past week in Schaaf's council district in East Oakland. But random killings -- those not directly tied to drugs or gangs or both -- happen all over Oakland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, Quinn Boyer, a Dublin man and San Jose paramedic, was shot and killed not far from his father's multimillion home on Skyline Boulevard. Five boys, two just 14, were later arrested on suspicion of carjacking, murder and robbery in the daytime killing and admitted their involvement, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaysha was shot and killed after she answered a doorbell at a friend's apartment on Wilson Avenue in the Dimond district, where she was spending the night with her best friend. The bullets pierced the apartment's metal gate and Alaysha's 7-year-old friend was wounded, as were her friend's 4-year-old brother and 64-year-old grandmother. No one has been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 12, Aya Nakano was an hour away from his 23rd birthday when he was shot and killed at 11 p.m. by a driver who rear-ended Nakano's Jeep Cherokee in North Oakland, and then shot him point blank when Nakano stepped out to discuss the crash. The case remains unsolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked for specifics about crime-fighting plans, Schaaf said that during the past six months, the council has allocated funding for 36 civilian positions for the crime lab, investigations and field support for officers, as well as roughly 75 more officers during the next two years. Also, ranks swelled for the first time in years with 30 new officers out of field training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My district has suffered two heartbreaking losses,&quot; said Schaaf, referring to the killings of Alaysha and Salamon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stand here today, united, and with the beautiful neighbors in this neighborhood to say to you 'enough is enough' and that Oakland is not going to live like this anymore,&quot; Schaaf said. &quot;We deserve a safe city, we demand a safe city.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE ONLY minority on the all-female jury in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case says George Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder&quot; when he fatally shot the black 17-year-old. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the juror, a 36-year-old mother of eight who moved to Florida from Chicago five months before she was selected for the trial, says the panel had no choice but to acquit Zimmerman, based on the law and evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder,&quot; said the juror. &quot;But you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, (Zimmerman is) going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror, who is of Puerto Rican descent and identified herself only by her first name, Maddy, shared her regrets during a television interview with Robin Roberts that will air in full on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot; Friday. Excerpts were shown on ABC programs Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy told Roberts she can't sleep at night because she is consumed by thoughts of Trayvon, who was shot to death while walking home from a convenience store in Sanford, Fla., last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for me to sleep, it's hard for me to eat because I feel I was forcefully included in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death,&quot; said the juror, who works as a nursing assistant. &quot;And as I carry him on my back, I'm hurting as much as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's mother because there's no way that any mother should feel that pain,&quot; Maddy added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her words echoed the anguish vented across the country after the July 13 verdict sparked an emotional debate on race and Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; self-defense law that saw President Obama chime in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy said that when the jury, which included five mothers, began deliberations, she was ready to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder, which could have put him behind bars for life. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury,&quot; she insisted. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after nine hours of reviewing evidence, Maddy decided the jury had to let the neighborhood watchman walk free, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't put the man in jail, even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; said the angst-ridden woman, known during the trial as Juror B29. &quot;But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question at the heart of the case was whether Zimmerman, 29, acted in self-defense because he thought his life was in danger - thereby bringing the shooting under the parameters of Florida's &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's where I felt confused,&quot; Maddy told Roberts. &quot;But as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy's approach contrasted sharply with that of Juror B37, who was first to speak out. That panelist, a white woman interviewed anonymously on CNN, expressed sympathy for Zimmerman and said Trayvon was partly responsible for his own death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Maddy and Juror B37 said the case was never about race.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only ethnic minority member of the jury told ABC News that she &quot;owes an apology to&quot; the 17-year-old's parents as she felt that she &quot;let them down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The black Hispanic woman, 36, who has eight children, said she believed Mr Zimmerman, who is white Hispanic, was guilty of the second-degree murder charge. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Barack Obama won elections in 2008 to become the first black president of the United States, hopes were running high that the country had reached a milestone in race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON: When Barack Obama won elections in 2008 to become the first black president of the United States, hopes were running high that the country had reached a milestone in race relations. Optimistic pundits began talking about a &quot;post-racial&quot; society. Polls showed that wide majorities expected racial attitudes to change for the better. Did they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is no, or not much, judging from reaction to the verdict in a murder trial in Florida that drew national and international attention. The case involved an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch captain, George Zimmerman, who said he had acted in self-defense. &quot;Not guilty&quot; sparked demonstrations across the country by people who thought justice had failed Martin because of his color. The verdict unleashed a tsunami of tweets - 4.5 million within the first 24 hours - condemning or applauding the jury's decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two national polls showed a huge racial divide over the outcome of the trial, followed breathlessly by U.S. TV networks. More than 80 percent of black Americans said they were dissatisfied with the verdict, roughly half of whites approved of it. The sharply conflicting views brought to mind the sensational trial of O.J. Simpson, the black football star accused of murdering his white girlfriend and an acquaintance of hers in 1994. The jury found him not guilty. The verdict, broadcast live, graphically illustrated the black-white perception gulf. Blacks cheered, whites looked shocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's election in 2008, and again in 2012, showed that a black American can rise to the country's highest office, evidence that the country is not as racist as some of its critics contend. The president has largely stayed away from the thorny subject of race but he tackled the issue with unusual and very personal remarks after a turbulent week in the wake of the Florida verdict. Making an unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room, he brought up a subject that is often missing from American debates about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a simple reason why black Americans and white Americans (and Latinos) have such starkly different views on how much of a role race plays in how people are treated - most blacks and Latinos have had personal experience of racist prejudice. Most whites have not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-Americans, Obama said, shared a set of experiences and a history that shaped their views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. And there are very few African-American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars ... There are very few African-Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, blacks arouse fear and suspicion, which is what the prosecution in the Florida case saw as the reason for Zimmerman to pursue the black teenager as he was walking in a predominantly white neighborhood. Unlike some of the black leaders who insist that justice failed in Florida, Obama touched on one of the reasons why young black men inspire fear in many whites: crime. &quot;African-American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system ... they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murder, for example, is the leading cause of death for black men aged 15 to 34, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no dispute over the disproportion Obama mentioned - the numbers are well known and often cited: black Americans account for roughly 13 percent of the population and for 40 percent of the male inmates in the country's jails and prisons. Part of this disparity, experts say, stems from unequal treatment by the police and the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers that most starkly highlight the lack of equal treatment come from the enforcement of drug laws. Blacks and whites engage in drug offences at roughly equivalent rates, according to government statistics, but African-Americans are almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites, according to federal data crunched by the American Civil Liberties Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such accounts deepen the conviction of many black Americans that they face an institutionalized bias that is difficult to overcome and goes beyond headline-making cases such as the Florida trial. Statistics show that this not merely a matter of perceptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in June by the Housing and Urban Development Department, for example, spoke volumes about discrimination that has changed in tone but not much in substance. &quot;Fewer minorities today may be getting the door slammed into their faces, but we continue to see evidence of housing discrimination that can limit a family's housing, economic and educational opportunities,&quot; said HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HUD survey, conducted every 10 years, looked at 28 cities across the United States and found that real estate agents showed minority [read: black] families fewer homes than white families and quoted them higher costs and security deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama ended his remarks on race on an optimistic note. &quot;I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better. Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wishful thinking?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check back in a generation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second juror in the trial of George Zimmerman has given a TV interview, saying the former neighborhood watch volunteer &quot;got away with murder&quot; when he was acquitted earlier this month in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman, identified in court as juror B29, who is part Hispanic, said she would have liked to convict Zimmerman of murdering Martin but said her hands were tied by a lack of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she told ABC's Robin Roberts in an interview to be aired this morning. &quot;But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence,&quot; the woman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter on July 13 after a racially charged trial. The verdict triggered demonstrations across the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors have remained anonymous under a judge's order. Juror B29 allowed her face to be shown, but used only the name Maddy. ABC said the 36-year-old woman is Puerto Rican and had recently moved to Florida from Chicago. She is a nursing assistant and mother of eight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 is the second juror to speak in a televised interview, and the first to show her face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B37, a mother of two who grew up in a military family, appeared last week on CNN with her face obscured. She said she believed Zimmerman, 29, was &quot;justified&quot; in shooting Martin, 17, during a confrontation in a gated community in central Florida in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B37 said she did not think Zimmerman racially profiled Martin and believed Martin attacked Zimmerman first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the interview, which prompted a hostile backlash on social media, CNN said four other jurors released a statement distancing themselves from the comments of B37.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 agreed with B37 that the case was never about race, despite accusations by the prosecution that Zimmerman had profiled Martin when he called police to report someone acting suspiciously in the community near Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution accused Zimmerman of profiling Martin and following him in the manner of a vigilante. Zimmerman's lawyers said he acted in self-defense after Martin started beating his head against a concrete sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the truth, juror B29 said Zimmerman had a lot to answer for. &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God.&quot; And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with,&quot; Maddy said. &quot; the law couldn't prove it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the jury began deliberations, she said she initially favored convicting Zimmerman. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the second day of deliberations she realized there was not enough proof to convict Zimmerman of murder or manslaughter under Florida law, she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little less rhetoric and a little more reflection might make the national conversation about race more productive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation regarding race followed this month's decision by a Florida jury to acquit George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin - and it is continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In watching the media coverage of the responses, it might appear that the conversations are more heated than thoughtful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama waded into the topic last Friday. &quot;You know, when Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;Another way of saying that is, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here. I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama articulated the answer to the first-level why question, but the whys should be asked in a deeper context. Why is the why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does the African-American community have a history that does not go away?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does Obama identify with a teenager who was found by a jury to have been shot in self-defense while beating Zimmerman? The Zimmerman legal defense team responded with a statement on its website, gzlegalcase.com. &quot;While we acknowledge and understand the racial context of this case, we challenge people to look closely and dispassionately at the facts. We believe those who look at the facts of the case without prejudice will see that it is a clear case of self-defense, and we are certain that those who take a closer look at the kind of person George Zimmerman is - something we understand the Department of Justice is currently doing - we are confident they will find a young man with a diverse ethnic and racial background who is not a racist, a man who is, in fact, sensitive to the complex racial history of our country. ... Before you judge George Zimmerman or disparage the verdict of the citizen jury, understand the facts in full.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are the facts in this case hard to accept?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's fight with Martin left him with a broken nose, two black eyes and two cuts on the back of his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do various groups agree on the facts in the case? If not, why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approval/ disapproval of the Zimmerman verdict varies greatly based on race, according to an ABC News/ Washington Post poll conducted by Langer Associates, released this past Monday (a random sample of 1,002 adults, July 18-21, 2013, by telephone in English and Spanish, with sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether the shooting was justified, 5 percent of blacks said yes, compared with 33 percent of whites and 16 percent of Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did the jury believe it was self-defense, but only 5 percent of blacks concur?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the verdict - 86 percent to 9 percent in favor; whites strongly approve - 51 percent to 31 percent opposed. This might lead one to believe that Americans' views are based primarily on skin color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the federal government should pursue civil-rights charges against Zimmerman, African-Americans responded yes/ no by 81-13 percent, with whites responding yes/no by 27-59 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are the views so different? Is it the opinion-makers and news media that the various groups turn to, to understand the facts involved? Is it personal history? If everyone were exposed to the same facts, would their conclusions still vary so widely?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are hard questions that lead not to answers, but to more questions. But that is what a conversation is - a place to dig deeper to uncover and bring understandings, misunderstandings and points of view into the light for others to listen to and reflect upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real national conversation about race would delve deeply into the why, without laying blame, to foster understanding, rather than simply the what.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish there were easy answers to the dialogue surrounding the murder of Trayvon Benjamin Martin and the acquittal of his assailant, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish we could just put it all to rest, saying it was a tragedy and that now, with the conclusion of the criminal proceedings, justice has been served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we can't. And we shouldn't. There are conversations to be explored, lessons to be learned and consequences impacting the America we profess to love -- if you love this country, you must love her people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent CNN panel, author Michaela Angela Davis referred to the challenge of African-American men. The days of ducking down, shuck-n-jive, getting by and getting home have not ended. It was telling to hear the male panelists, ranging from young adulthood to middle-age, recount the warnings their parents gave them, now made to their sons. My parents and aunt made the same warnings to my brothers and male cousins; I now pass them on to the young men in my world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was telling and painful to watch as the President of the United States of America stood before the White House press corps and revealed that, not only could he have been Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, he had been profiled and held suspect -- because of the color of his skin. And he tried to explain the outrage of the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is painful as my brothers and nephews relate stories about experiences and the on-going presuppositions made based upon their appearance. It is more painful when they brush off these unjust experiences as another part of life. As children of the Civil Rights era it is doubly painful -- our parents dared to challenge racist structures, our generation was supposed to be different, the heralds of a new era in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was called many untrue things -- criminal, aggressor, drug-user, gang member. He was a 17-year- old boy, walking from the store in his father's neighborhood, minding his own business, chatting with his friend on the cellphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This child was a good son, an honors student, on his way to college, who performed community service and was active in his church. He had no criminal record. He was not affiliated with a gang. He wore a hooded sweatshirt on a rainy evening -- and he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation has failed to reflect upon the safety of any child on our streets, even in a gated community. The conversation has failed to consider that all of our children are schooled to stay away from strangers who approach them -- and to fight back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend asked me, &quot;Why are you people still talking about this? Zimmerman won; let it rest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We &quot;people&quot; are still talking about it because it needs to be discussed. This is not about black-on-black killing in the ghettos. This is not about the number of black kids caught up in the criminal justice system. Although these issues are pervasive and point to larger systemic issues, they are simply not the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unadulterated issue is this -- children are not safe. Not only do they have to defer to law enforcement, we must now teach them to defer to armed civilians acting as vigilantes who suspect them of wrongdoing based upon the color of their skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And had the tables been turned, the whole case would have been handled differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless we root out the prejudices within our hearts, unless we confront them and educate ourselves, racism will remain prevalent in our society - on both systemic and individual levels. Until we confront our unfortunate collective history, the legacy of slavery still coloring perceptions and policy, and raise these ghosts we will never lay them to rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're tired. And by 2013, we thought we'd be talking about something else.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting worse, not better</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, America's family social values system is gradually getting worse, not better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family life is inconceivable without a system of morality; a system where families are expected to embrace tradition and uphold a behavior of respect for the past and concern for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Machiavellian treatise, a democracy in transition eventually turns into anarchy; a lawless society where deteriorating family values lead to deviant behavior, immorality, and rising acts of crime and corruption. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in the process of instituting a permissive state of society; a society where integrity, trust, self-respect and respect for others give way to offensive and unacceptable behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To uproot our fundamental family values is to destroy the rule of law itself. Where the law leaves a legal vacuum, a state of anarchy will replace it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent reports show that the rising numbers of one-parent families and illegitimacy are harmful to society and devastating to the individuals concerned. The costly consequences of one-parent families and illegitimacy imposed upon our society breed unacceptable issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social values parents impart will determine the lifestyle children will embrace. Under these conditions, accountable and prudent parenting is crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As responsible families we are expected to cultivate, not plunder, the earth, and to plan not just for ourselves but for our posterity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gus Sambrano, Sr. Central El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natural tendency for human beings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are all born with a natural appetite or natural tendency, built-in aspects of what it means to be a human being. We should know truths about God and about living in society, judgments about right and wrong, which are based on the rational perception of reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, next to that built aspects, we have inherited a sinful nature to restrain from expression. If human conduct in &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;A nation under God&quot; have no truth, no goodness, beauty, nor good morality other than what the majority of nine appointed human beings happen to say is true, good, beautiful and moral, we will surely become a nation where God's divine words of salvation become a matter of choice and merely taste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As God's adopted children, our faith and spiritual salvation has to rest not on human wisdom, but on the power of God's teachings. Many truly do not believe in God; others are afraid to get close to Him or to find a religion, because it measures our sinfulness and our evil against God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We as Catholics and faithful Christians, should have an attitude that the world we live in needs to be safe; that we pass our days here on a temporal and perishable earth, but we are citizens of heaven. Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesus Manuel Valenzuela, Anthony, N.M.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media should play fair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When is the El Paso Times and the rest of the media going to quit using a picture of Trayvon Martin when he was 12 years old? Print a picture of him as a 17-year-old. Show what he really looked like on that rainy night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See if Obama will still claim him as his &quot;son.&quot; Or at least run a picture of Zimmerman when he was 12 along side the picture of Obama's &quot;son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glenn Wood, East El Paso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our country is next</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You asked for it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I read today in the paper about the furloughs and the cuts in the military budget which has upset many civilian employes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emperor Obama last year told you that he was going to cut the military budget, so we would be a toothless tiger and a Third World nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accomplished that. Look how Russia and China treat him. We lost the respect of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he tries to impose his will in the middle East. For four years he did nothing. Now he tries to push Israel to start talks at any cost. He just wants to leave a legacy when he exits office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, what a legacy indeed! A legacy of having half the population of this great country depending on the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now his Obamacare is coming unraveled. Even the Democrats are calling it a train wreck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the ACA many people are having their hours reduced below 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember what he said? I am doing it for the middle class. Guess who he is going to hurt more with all his liberal policies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to jobs and health care, the middle-class is the one that is hurting. He did not want to cut the entitlements and motivate the people to go find a job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney, on the other hand, said we need to keep our military strong to be the super power in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to create jobs and reform entitlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to &quot;Do not ask what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many things we'd wish away, if we could. War, poverty, racism. ... The list is long. &quot;All You Need Is Love,&quot; went the Beatles' song. Tragically, this is probably true. Love seems to be in short supply today. Our world grows smaller and tensions between us stronger and more apparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember a conversation some years ago during a committee meeting. We were discussing the problem of homelessness. We decided to explore our own prejudices as a way to understand why others may project negative attributes on people they perceive to be homeless. One of the members of the committee commented on her impression of a young woman she had seen on the plaza. She described the young woman as having a head that was half shaved, with the remaining hair dyed green. She assumed the young woman was homeless and probably up to no good. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I identified the young woman immediately. &quot;That happens to be my stepdaughter,&quot; I interjected. &quot;She is a straight-A student in high school, and by no means homeless.&quot; This was a moment of insight for me. Since I was OK with her appearance, I assumed others would be as well. The quality of her heart seemed more important than the color of her hair. We can't always trust others to see things our way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fast forward to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, walking home from a neighborhood store with a pack of Skittles and a soft drink. His appearance, simply because he was a black young man wearing a hooded sweatshirt, was enough to set off a series of events that ended in his death. Call it prejudice, or whatever. We make assumptions about one another on first impression that, more often than not, prove to be wrong. Rushing to judgment is a big mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a white man from a Midwestern town. I grew up during the civil rights era of the 1960s and '70s. There were riots in neighborhoods close by. But racism didn't touch my life much. I went to a college preparatory school where 99 percent of us went on to college. About one quarter of the student body were African American. We competed for the best grades, and in sports. We sang together in choir. I didn't see what the big deal about race was all about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't until I moved to New York City that I began to understand the extent and depth of racism in America. In the world I grew up in -- and Stephen Colbert does a wonderful parody of it -- we didn't see race. As long as people talked, acted, dressed and went to the same schools we did, there really didn't seem to be much difference between us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism is, and has always been, about class. I watched something recently that mentioned the Know-Nothing Party, an anti-immigrant group from the mid-nineteenth century. In those days, the enemy were German and eastern European immigrants, mostly Roman Catholic. Like Mexican immigrants today, these newcomers were perceived as taking jobs from the rest of us. The Know-Nothing party was out to preserve America for Americans. I wonder how many Tea Party members trace their roots back to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, simply playing by the rules is not enough to protect you or those you love from prejudice. We live in a multi-cultural society, with many valid ways of expressing ourselves. We often speak and dress and act in ways that don't necessarily conform to the established view of how we should do these things. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin represents people who are unseen and unheard, not because of who they are, but because of what they appear to be to others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family George Zimmerman rescued from their burning SUV is refusing interviews for fear of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman whose phone number is one digit different from that of the line Zimmerman used to call police is getting death threats. That phone number appeared repeatedly throughout the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George's family is in hiding from death threats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a news intern asked President Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, if the president was going to do anything to protect Zimmerman's family, Carney sneered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, after Judicial Watch discovered documents showing President Obama's Department of Justice helped organize anti-Zimmerman protests, leading to the firing of the Sanford police chief and the ultimate trial of George Zimmerman who, in case you may have forgotten, was found not guilty of murder or manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This innocent man whose maternal grandparents were black and Hispanic has been portrayed as a racist and now fears for his life due to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is pushback now against the Obama Administration, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and others determined to bring Zimmerman to court on charges that Zimmerman violated Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's civil rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This pushback is from both the political left and the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservatives are fighting against the President's potential to override the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party-leaning inner-city minorities are fighting for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While conservatives are sharing research from the British press that the American press is ignoring about George Zimmerman, local papers like Philadelphia's Daily News are sharing the stories and opinions of city minorities who are sick of the big national games being played with the lives of George Zimmerman and his family while their political leaders ignore the violence that takes so many lives from their families every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what the London newspaper, The Telegraph, published about George Zimmerman that you have likely never seen, heard or read in the major media outlets in the U.S.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman voted and campaigned for Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman and his black friend opened an insurance company in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman has black family members. Some of George's black family members lived with him, at some point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman launched a campaign to help a homeless black man who was beaten up by a white kid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George dated and took a black girl to the prom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman also mentored young black school kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, powerful people say he's a racist and needs to be put in jail somehow even though he shot Trayvon in self defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the city of Philadelphia, people are angry at the activists spending so much time protesting Zimmerman and ignoring their local &quot;Trayvons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City resident Patricia Thomas told the Philadelphia Daily News, &quot;My daughter said, 'They keep going on with this Trayvon&nbsp;Martin stuff but all these Trayvon&nbsp;Martins are here in Philadelphia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon, OK, but what about Tremaine? What about this other little boy that got killed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tremaine Rogers was one of hundreds of Philly's murder victims over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African American boy didn't know his killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seventeen-year-old Tremaine Rogers didn't have a bag of Skittles or an iced tea on him when he was shot in the back on July 13 outside of his home. He had a basketball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was killed in his own back yard at 4 p.m. by two black men for refusing to answer one question: 'We cool?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody automatically assumes that if you hear of a young African-American getting killed he was involved in something negative,&quot; says Tremaine's mentor, Kenyatta McKinney, who has lost 35 friends to the streets of Philadelphia. &quot;People are just becoming a number in Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Rogers, Tremaine's 19 year-old brother, said, &quot;We're living in a city where people die over a conflict, over a female, over a dollar, over drugs. It's a lot of petty things going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial came just hours after Tremaine's slaying and dominated the news for days did not make things easier for his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like people don't understand. It's black-on-black but they're worried about white-on-black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just trying to be racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did you hear that, Mr. President? That's from the street, not a professional activist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turn on the TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the &quot;big news&quot; is the birth of a British royal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Drudge ran the birth of the Prince of Cambridge at the top of his page, treating it like it was the biggest event out of Europe since D-Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the media wanted to change the subject to something pleasant -- or completely unimportant -- but the arrival of Kate and William's baby boy was a timely blessing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It blew George Zimmerman, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and the issue of race in America off the front pages. It even eclipsed President Obama's teleprompter-free speech about the Zimmerman verdict last Friday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal media, as usual, gave the presidential sermon a standing ovation, saying that Obama -- who claimed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been him 35 years ago -- hit a home run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I agree with what that old boo-bird Bill O'Reilly said on his TV show Monday night. The president didn't whiff completely, but he grounded out weakly to second base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Reilly, madder than usual, praised the president in his &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; for bringing up the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then he blasted Obama and other black leaders for still having &quot;no clue&quot; how to solve the social and moral problems that continue to rip apart black communities in our cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They won't dare mention the issues of drug gangs, out-of-wedlock births, fatherless families and welfare dependency, O'Reilly railed, &quot;because race hustlers and the grievance industry have intimidated the so-called 'conversation,' turning any valid criticism of African-American culture into charges of racial bias.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Reilly pointed out that, yes, Martin was profiled by Zimmerman, the community watchman. But it wasn't because of his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was because Martin was wearing a hoodie -- the official national uniform of urban street thugs and drug gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Obama said Martin could have been him 35 years ago, he was talking nonsense. Thirty-five years ago, Barack Obama wasn't stalking around gated communities at night wearing gangster clothes and getting in fistfights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death was a horrible tragedy. That cannot be said too many times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Martin's death should not be exploited any further by the president or anyone else as proof that white racism is the chief cause of problems in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black communities have been breeding a criminal class for decades. Repealing stand-your-ground laws or passing stricter gun control laws will not change that. Nor will blaming the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The black community's problems begin at home. They are not a result of slavery or discrimination or poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are, as O'Reilly said, a result of the disintegration of the black family, a gangster culture that glorifies criminals, and a bunch of so-called civil rights leaders who ignore reality, preach victimhood and blame racism for everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young black males are dying at disproportionate rates in Chicago and other cities not because they're being shot by racist white cops, or wanna-be cops like George Zimmerman, but because they are being gunned down by other young black males, usually over drug-gang turf wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Reilly said, &quot;It's now time for the African-American leadership, including President Obama, to stop the nonsense. Walk away from the world of victimization and grievance and lead the way out of this mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders, including the president, need to step up and start talking about the real causes of crime and poverty in black communities. So should our gutless media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a year the president and black leaders have cynically exploited a tragedy to &quot;prove&quot; that society still needs to do much more for blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead they should be using Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death as an opportunity to start an honest national discussion about what the black community needs to do for itself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Gov. Rick Scott has rejected a request that he remove State Attorney Angela Corey from the Michael Dunn/Jordan Davis case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida Civil Rights Association sent a letter to Scott on Wednesday saying a special prosecutor should be appointed in place of Corey because she has lost all credibility with the public. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an email to the Times-Union Thursday afternoon, Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said the governor would not be appointing a special prosecutor. A representative for the Davis family also said they were not consulted about the request and don't want Corey off the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Dunn, 46, who is white, shot into a Dodge Durango with four black teens in a dispute about loud music. Only 17-year-old Davis was hit and killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dunn is charged with first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder. Corey is personally prosecuting the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the letter Florida Civil Rights Association president J. Willie David III said Corey has shown her office lacks credibility, is untrustworthy and does not hold the public confidence needed to prosecute in good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackelyn Barnard, Corey's spokeswoman, did not respond to a phone call or email for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey's unsuccessful prosecution of George Zimmerman in Sanford has created racial tension, David said. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin and was acquitted this month on the basis of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey was the special prosecutor in that case and was criticized for the way the case was handled. Her office still faces potential sanctions in that case because of allegations that evidence was withheld from defense attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Davis family does not support what the civil rights organization is asking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Florida Civil Rights Association never called us, sought our input and yet went to the media with their opinion of what is best for Jordan,&quot; said attorney John Phillips, who represents the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trial date has been set for September, but Dunn attorney Cory Strolla said at a recent hearing that he would not be ready until February because of all the information and witnesses he still had to go over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday he said he had not read the letter asking for Corey's removal and could not comment on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David also said Corey's credibility had been hurt by the allegations of two former employees, Ben Kruidbos and Julie Lyncker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruidbos was the information technology director who was fired by Corey after he testified last month about being concerned prosecutors did not turn over information to Zimmerman's defense team. His attorney has said they plan to sue Corey for wrongful termination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey's office also faces potential sanctions in Lyncker's wrongful termination lawsuit after the State Attorney's Office turned over key email evidence the weekend before a jury was supposed to be picked. The case was indefinitely continued to give Lyncker's attorneys time to examine the emails and make sure there wasn't any other missing evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lyncker was a clerk in the Nassau County office who says she was fired after she complained about the actions of her supervisor. Attorneys for Corey said Lyncker engaged in inappropriate behavior at the office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian T. Croall, 44, of 20 Durrell Drive, is being held on $50,000 cash or surety bail for possession of firearms and drugs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was previously arrested for vandalism July 17 for allegedly vandalizing 14 signs owned by either the town or state and is being held on $25,000 cash for vandalism and criminal threatening charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Croall remains incarcerated at Rockingham County Jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a clerk from Rockingham County Superior Court, Croall is charged with being a felon in possession of firearms, criminal mischief, possession of a narcotic drug, possession of a controlled drug, two counts of criminal threatening, and theft by unauthorized taking. Croall allegedly stole a solar light from one of his neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a report published Wednesday by the Union Leader, the damage to signs was estimated to be about $1,650 by Newmarket Public Works Director Richard Malasky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vandalism allegedly included offensive and racist messages, and threatening notes were found on telephone poles and trees in town and also on Croall's property, according to the Union Leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newmarket police prosecutor Michael DiCroce told the Union Leader that some of those messages referenced George Zimmerman, the Florida man recently acquitted of killing teenager Trayvon Martin, as a hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DiCroce was not available for comment Thursday and a message to Newmarket Lt. Kyle True was not returned by deadline Thursday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the dozens of firearms, police also found 1,000 rounds of ammunition, according to the Union Leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2012, Croall was convicted of felony level reckless conduct following an incident at the Chop Shop Pub in Seabrook where he discharged a firearm into the air. He had reportedly been complaining before firing the shot that his car radio had been stolen while his vehicle was parked in the Lafayette Road parking lot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Crown Heights riots  offer a model to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preamble to the U. S. Constitution   which speaks of preserving justice,  domestic tranquility, general welfare,  liberty and, not least, a sense of national unity   could read like a CliffNotes version of the  Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman debate.  Taken together, these words suggest that the  feds have a duty to intervene. But how?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd argue that the most useful precedent is  the federal civil rights conviction of Lemrick  Nelson for the killing of Yankel Rosenbaum,  an Orthodox Jew, during the 1991 Crown  Heights riots. The two cases are remarkably </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">similar, and we can learn  a lot about one from the  other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, most  legal chatter centers  on the possibility of  the Justice Department  bringing federal hatecrimes  charges against  Zimmerman, under  the so-called Matthew  Shepard and James Byrd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. That  would be a mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hate crimes law would require the prosecution  to prove that Zimmerman willfully  intended to cause bodily injury to Trayvon  Martin because of his race. This raises the  same problem as the state trial: We don't  know exactly what happened in the moments  before the shot was fired. Did Zimmerman  pull the trigger because Martin was black?  Or was he, at that moment, motivated by  fear and self-defense? Intent is crucial in hatecrimes  cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong case can be made that Zimmerman  was motivated by race at the beginning of  the confrontation, when he saw Martin and  decided to follow him. His phone calls to 911  show it. But was he intending at that point  to cause injury? There's no evidence of that.  And by the time he grabbed his gun, he may  simply have panicked, finding he'd gotten in  over his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a conviction probably could be  obtained under another federal statute: the  Civil Rights Act of 1964. That's the law used to  convict Lemrick Nelson in the killing of Yankel  Rosenbaum. Under its terms, Zimmerman  could be charged with the wrong that seems  most demonstrably to have been committed:  harassing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin because of his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson was arrested on the night of August  19, 1991, for the stabbing of Rosenbaum, 29,  an Australian visitor staying with Lubavitch  Hasidim in Crown Heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was established that Nelson was part of  a mob out to avenge the death of a 7-year-old  black child who'd been run over that  evening by a speeding Hasidic driver. When  Rosenbaum appeared there were shouts of  get the Jew. Police found Nelson hiding in  bushes near the crime scene with a bloody  knife that tested positive for Rosenbaum's  DNA. Rosenbaum identified him before he  died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, the jury in Nelson's state murder  trial found him not guilty. After the verdict, 11  of the 12 jurors  10 blacks and two whites   went out to dinner with Nelson and his  lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal sparked widespread outrage  among New York Jews. Months of protests  followed. Rosenbaum's brother Norman,  an Australian attorney, spent much of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">next two years in New York and Washington,  pressing for a federal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, the Clinton Justice Department  charged Nelson under a portion of the 1964  Civil Rights Act that outlaws racially-motivated  hindrance of a person's legal enjoyment of  public accommodations. Included are lodgings,  restaurants and recreational facilities.  In the Nelson case, the Justice Department  expanded the list to include city streets.  Nelson was convicted in 1997 of denying  Rosenbaum the use of the streets of Brooklyn  by stabbing him, because he was Jewish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It shouldn't be too difficult to make the case  that George Zimmerman initiated a confrontation  with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin with the racially  motivated intention of hindering Martin's use  of the streets of Sanford, Florida. The facts  seem pretty clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether a civil rights charge could then be  linked to Martin's death is a separate question.  Here again, the Crown Heights case is  instructive. Rosenbaum died of internal bleeding  after Kings County Hospital failed to notice  one of his stab wounds. The defense claimed  the hospital error mitigated Nelson's culpability.  But the judge ruled the error irrelevant.  Nelson was found to have initiated the  racially-motivated chain of events that led to  Rosenbaum's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that precedent is followed, Zimmerman  could conceivably receive a lengthy sentence  for initiating a civil rights violation that led to  Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nelson's 1997 civil rights verdict didn't  stand. An appeals court found the trial judge  had taken illegal steps to ensure a diverse  jury. When Nelson was retried in federal  court in 2003, jurors decided (defying the  judge's instruction) that the hospital rather  than Nelson was responsible for Rosenbaum's  death. Nelson was convicted on the lesser  charge of racially motivated obstruction and  given a relatively light sentence, 10 years  minus time served. He got out in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a Zimmerman civil rights trial were to  follow the narrower precedent of the second  Nelson trial, then Zimmerman could serve  up to 10 years for depriving Martin of his  civil rights. Some might call that too lenient.  Others might say it's overly harsh for a case  of self-defense. But it seems to address the  core issue of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's another lesson for today in the  Nelson case, and it's a cautionary one. For  many New York Jews, the riots, murder and  acquittal got wrapped up in a broader narrative  of rampant black anti-Semitism. Fingers  were pointed at the city's first black mayor,  David Dinkins. Conservatives accused him of  excessive leniency toward black lawbreakers  and even outright anti-Semitism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn, many blacks believed the Jewish  community was exploiting the Rosenbaum  tragedy to weaken Dinkins. The furor  helped sink Dinkins' 1993 reelection bid. On  Election eve, when Republican challenger  Rudy Giuliani stepped to the microphones to  declare victory, Australian lawyer Norman  Rosenbaum was at his right shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same dynamic may be unfolding on a  national scale in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, with  angry blacks taking on the role of outraged  Jews and white conservatives taking the place  of indignant, defensive New York blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesson of Crown Heights ought to be that  a criminal trial can bring closure when justice  is done in fair measure, but when it becomes  a symbolic crusade for victory over enemies,  it only deepens the bitterness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens when following the letter of the law still leads  to an unjust outcome? What is the remedy? What, besides  expressing deep outrage, are ordinary citizens to do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal of George Zimmerman of murder and manslaughter  charges in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin left many Americans holding  two thoughts that at first seem contradictory. On the one hand, considering  Florida's permissive laws on self-defense and gun use, topped  by the prosecution's flawed performance, the jury probably came to a  reasonable conclusion. And yet, an innocent young man is dead and  the person who pulled the trigger should somehow be held responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these thoughts aren't necessarily contradictory. A verdict in  a criminal trial  especially one bound up with race and wound up  by a voracious, non-stop media machine  does not necessarily render  moral judgment and create a kind of civic accountability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, we rely on the legal system too much to give us a definitive  judgment of events, Perry Dane, a professor at Rutgers School of  Law, told the Forward. As citizens, we are still entitled to say something  unjust happened, that [Zimmerman] did something unjust beyond  the reach of criminal law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A legal decision is determined by a specialized form of evaluation  and an intentionally difficult standard when the outcome could  be a person's loss of freedom or loss of life. Implicit in that high bar  is the awareness that a defendant might actually be guilty even if he  or she is legally exonerated. Most of the public certainly came to that  conclusion in 1995, when, according to a Gallup-CNN/USA Today  poll, only 33% agreed with the acquittal of O. J. Simpson in an even  more circus-like murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We won't be surprised if polling after the Zimmerman verdict  shows the same pattern. One can acknowledge the legal limitations  of determining guilt while still believing that the fact that an unarmed  young man was shot dead by an armed civilian who ignored entreaties  to stay in his car ought to leave every American outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the remedy? What should citizens do to correct this  injustice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One avenue is certainly legislative. Florida's Stand Your Ground  law was barely mentioned at Zimmerman's trial, but it framed the  context and the outcome. Under the law, a version of which exists  in more than 20 states, people fearing for their lives can use deadly  force even if the possibility existed of retreating from a confrontation.  Eliminating the duty to retreat radically redefines the legal concept  of self-defense, which has until now considered deadly force as the  absolute last resort outside the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida was the first state to enact Stand Your Ground, in 2005,  and from the beginning, law enforcement officials have been among  its staunchest critics. Miami's chief of police said it was unnecessary  and dangerous. The head of the association representing prosecuting  attorneys has called for its repeal. For good reason: A study commission  by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that in states  with Stand Your Ground laws, the number of homicides had significantly  increased from the years before the law was enacted. As many  feared, the law encourages the use of deadly force when there is, in  fact, either no danger or less dangerous alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now researchers are picking up another disturbing trend:  racial disparities. A study by the Urban Institute's Justice Policy Center  commissioned by PBS's Frontline using FBI data found that whites  who kill blacks in Stand Your Ground states are far more likely to be  found justified in their killings than are blacks who kill, regardless of  the race of their victims. The data doesn't yet prove bias, because the  circumstances of these one-on-one killings isn't analyzed, but it certainly  hints at it. Fortunately, the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights is  launching a broader, more detailed investigation of those concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important thing to remember here is that Stand Your Ground  laws aren't the result of grassroots activism sparked by an expanded  desire for citizen self-defense. They are a national product pushed  by allies of the gun lobby. And they have been approved by so many  state legislatures because that lobby has figured out how to wield enormous  power in Tallahassee and Austin and Harrisburg and Helena  while no one else cared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So ordinary citizens have to try much harder to outflank this  growing power. It's not sexy stuff. Anyone who has spent time in a  state capitol knows that. But it's no coincidence that on this issue, and  countless others, the lack of scrutiny  exacerbated, we might add, by  the unconscionable decision by too many news outlets to scale back  their coverage of state lawmakers  has allowed clever, well-funded  national lobbies to shape, if not dictate, consequential laws. And the  embarrassingly low turnout in elections for state legislatures allows  that power to grow unchecked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be difficult emotionally to draw a direct line between the occasional  campaign for a State House seat and the understandable pain,  fear and anger felt by so many Americans, especially those who look  like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, after this verdict. Repealing a handful of dangerous  laws is hardly the only way to address the deep-seated racial bias  that still exists on America's streets, in its courtrooms and its halls of  power. But it's a start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America has had other unjust laws that were erased by the brave  work of those who knew this nation had the capacity to live up to  higher moral standards. Sadly, that work must continue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last weekend, when people in Oakland wanted to protest George Zimmerman's acquittal in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, they marched to the Fruitvale station of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. The location is freighted with significance: Shortly after midnight on Jan. 1, 2009, a transit police officer shot and killed a 22-year-old black man by the name of Oscar Grant. Videos of the incident posted online spurred protests, rioting and the eventual conviction of the officer. They also prompted Ryan Coogler, a 27-year-old Bay Area filmmaker, to write and direct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Fruitvale Station</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, his impressive debut feature. After winning awards at Sundance and Cannes, the film opens in Toronto Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What was your primary motivation to make the film?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seeing the footage, the first time I saw it, I was shocked, sick to my stomach with what I saw. And I was really emotionally moved by it. I went from shock to anger to sadness to confusion - and, more than anything, to helplessness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And I felt close to him, emotionally tied, because I looked at Oscar and I saw myself. He looked like me, he was the same age as me, was from where I'm from. His friends looked like my friends, you know? I've been in similar situations before, and I just couldn't help but think about - what if I didn't make it home to my family, make it home to the people that I matter to?From there, I saw people protesting, rioting. People went back and forth, picked sides, saying hateful things on the Internet. Nobody was really talking about the fact that this human being lost his life, you know? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was a political push-pull as far as what Oscar's identity was. As soon as it happened, everybody felt they could grab his identity and use it for whatever agenda, whatever point they wanted to make. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You mean on both sides? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On both sides, man. Like, people on one side wanted to make him out to be this martyr: 'He was an activist, he was a peacekeeper, he was this perfect guy who never did anything wrong in his life - and he was martyred for his beliefs.' And on the other side: 'He was just this felon, he was a thug, he was a drug dealer. He got what he deserved.' But if you rewind the clock back to Dec. 31, 2008, there are people who Oscar Grant meant the world to, at that time, before he was killed. People whose lives revolved around him, and I wanted to get those relationships, because I felt like that's where the humanity exists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oscar's family gave you the life rights to his story and they acted as advisers on the film. Given their involvement, did you feel you had the freedom to depict him as less than perfect? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Absolutely. I thought that was necessary, to show he was struggling - and he was struggling with a lot. He was a guy who just got out of prison and was still doing the things that got him there in the first place. All his relationships with the women that mattered in his life were strained. His daughter, he was trying to catch up for lost time. He'd spent nearly half her life incarcerated, you know? Obviously he and his mom had their issues, and he and [his girlfriend] Sophina have their issues. And I thought it was important to show those issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's interesting that you said you looked at the footage and said, &quot;It could have been me.&quot; That echoes what Barack Obama said recently about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. How comfortable are you with people drawing comparisons between the cases?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm not very comfortable with it at all, man, to be honest. It was never intended for this film to be released coinciding with what happened with the George Zimmerman case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A critic with the Washington Post said the film &quot;transcends heated rhetoric and reflexive anger.&quot; Was that your aim? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The film for me wasn't about anger; it was about love, and it was about the love that he had in his relationships. And there's nothing perfect on this planet, you know what I'm saying? We all have tremendous flaws - we all do. And I think if we look at people as people who have love in their life - that's a different way of looking at somebody. And I always thought more can be accomplished that way. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What would you hope the film achieves? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I like to make films when I have questions about something. The question that I started with this was: Why is it that I can wake up in the morning, read a news report about some tragedy that's happening - let's say the tsunami that happened in Indonesia. I'm able to see it and I'm maybe a little bit affected by it, but then I'll brush my teeth, I'll put my clothes on and go off to work and I'll have a day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But say, rewind the clock back, and I get a call that someone I'm close with has lost their life - God forbid. It's a completely different feeling, you know what I mean? I'm devastated. I'm not able to function, I'm not able to go on. And so my question is: Why is that? Why do we have to be intimate with somebody to feel something if something happens to them? Why do we have to be intimate with somebody to recognize them as human beings? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think the short answer is that if we all felt as strongly about every single tragedy as we do about the incidents that are close to us, we'd never get anything done. Not to minimize what you're saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I completely agree with you. It's almost a survival mechanism, right? And a coping mechanism. And I think that that same mechanism can also be hurtful because it's a mechanism that lets us see people as others, as not part of [our] community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The movie's website asks people to repost photos from the film on their Tumblr as a way to &quot;join a movement,&quot; to &quot;raise awareness of social injustice.&quot; What exactly does that mean? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To be honest with you, man, the website is run by the Weinstein Company's marketing division, you know. That's not my website so I don't feel comfortable answering your question about that. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fruitvale Station </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Written and directed by Ryan Coogler </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Starring Michael B. Jordan and Melonie Diaz </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Classification: 14A </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">**&frac12;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already a hot-button item following screenings at Sundance and Cannes that reportedly reduced audiences to tears, Ryan Coogler's potent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Fruitvale Station</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, about the last day in the life of a 22-year-old black man who was killed while handcuffed at an Oakland, Calif., subway station on New Year's Day, 2009, now has even more heat cranked up in the wake of the Trayvon Martin verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening with the terrifying cellphone video footage of Oscar Grant's last moments - footage that contributed to the public outrage that broke out in the Bay area following the incident - Coogler's movie then moves to the morning hours of Dec. 31, 2008: Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan), an ex-con with a drug-dealing past, a terminated job in a fish market, a Latina girlfriend (Melonie Diaz) and a four-year-old daughter (Ariana Neal), is trying to make out with his girlfriend when little Tatiana comes to the door.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instantly, we are made aware of a few things about Oscar that will remain in play until we arrive at the station: Oscar is a decent, responsible, family-oriented guy with the odds stacked against him, prepared to take his daughter to daycare and mindful that it's his mother's birthday - but none of this matters. That opening has embedded the inevitable in our minds, and no amount of niceness, creatively condensed and embellished though some of it may be, will save this man from the incident we've just witnessed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shot largely on hand-held super-16mm video and unfolding with a grainy veneer of docudramatic realism, Coogler's first movie is a triumph of social-realist emotional engagement. Thanks partly to the casting of the magnetic Michael B. Jordan (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Wire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s similarly doomed teenage project victim, Wallace), but largely to the filmmaker's careful observation of heart-tugging domestic incidentals - Oscar's promise to his daughter that they'll go to Chuck E. Cheese the next day, his 'Happy Birthday!!' text to his mother (Octavia Spencer), the trip to the store he was recently fired from for birthday dinner crabs (from which he calls his grandmother to help a white woman with the rudiments of a fish fry) - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Fruitvale Station</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> starts stockpiling emotional ammunition from the beginning, building to almost excruciating proportions by the time the man says goodbye to his daughter before boarding the train to his appointment with that real-life footage. Of one thing in this movie there is no doubt: For a first film (Coogler is 27) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Fruitvale Station</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a powerhouse of sustained empathetic engagement, and as difficult to resist as Jordan's starburst of a smile. But therein also lies its limitations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without even delving into the movie's well-documented embellishments - an incident involving a doomed stray pit bull, the phoning of grandma for fish fry wisdom, an incident during a prison visit with Oscar's mother that introduces the ugly white guy who will spark the fateful brawl on the subway - the fact is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Fruitvale Station</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> makes the case that the tragedy of Oscar Grant isn't that he was a black man killed by a white cop under hair-raisingly unjustifiable circumstances, but that he was such a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">sweet</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> black man. For this is what, more than anything else, the film wishes to stress: Although marked by a checkered, drug-dealing past, and prone to (under the circumstances) perfectly reasonable fits of rage, he was a good father, son, grandson, friend, citizen and animal-lover, and so his final destruction is felt on those terms. We feel the death on the platform so acutely not because it's a stupid act of random but hardly untypical racist violence, but because we've come to love this man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not to suggest that Oscar Grant wasn't lovable - most accounts suggest he was - nor that there's no place for sentiment in movies that deal with real-life racial issues, or even that Coogler is wrong in his apparent determination to bring some humanity to a figure otherwise likely just to be regarded as a statistic, a name, or, worse, just another unarmed black man gunned down by a white man in 21st century America. The issue is whether Oscar Grant and the tragedy he represents - an ongoing tragedy now freshly re-kindled because of the Martin case - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">needs</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be so emotionally manipulated in order to engage our sympathy and spark our outrage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps that's the case. But if it is, the problem concerning race and violence in America is actually far worse than one might otherwise imagine. For it suggests that it's not tragedy enough on its own. Of course, it's a movie, and movies aren't real life. But when movies open with such a socio-politically explosive incident captured directly from real life, then proceed to build back toward its fictionalized re-enactment with so many acts of irresistible dramatic enhancement, you have to wonder why the facts aren't heartbreaking all on their own. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pg. 18</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US is always collectively amazed, on those rare occasions when it has cause to glimpse at how it is perceived by its less friendly critics abroad. The most egregious example, of course, was 9/11, when even the brutal enormity of the attack against America was not quite enough to still the hateful tongues of people crass enough to insist that the US had got what was coming to it. The citizens of the US have an absolute right to go about their business without being slaughtered. Which is why the world is aghast that this right does not extend as far as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the unarmed 17-year-old was shot dead by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman on 26 February 2012, the killer wasn't even arrested for 44 days, having said that he fired in self-defence. Self-defence? He'd already called the police, telling the operator that Martin was acting suspiciously - &quot;up to no good, on drugs or something&quot;. Zimmerman had been told by the operator not to follow the teenager. But nevertheless he found himself and his gun right next to Martin, provoking a struggle. What kind of self-defence is this, when you decide that someone is trouble and that you're going to stalk him, safe in the knowledge that if things get out of hand . . . well, you're armed? Yet a jury decided that going out armed, looking for a particular person to defend yourself against, is still self-defence, and on 13 July Zimmerman was acquitted of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only protest from the public ensured that Zimmerman was tried at all. Only protest from the public has ensured that this killing has been seen through the prism of race. Yet to an outsider it is obvious that Martin died because he was black, and that Zimmerman walked free after killing him for the same reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors say that they acted in strict accordance with the law of the land. They probably did. The law of the land in the US was formulated so that settlers could carry guns in self-defence against their enemies - Native Americans. Later, similar rights over the lives and deaths of slaves pertained. All that is so deeply embedded in the US collective psyche that it's easier to forget that it's there than remember it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though equal civil rights for black Americans are still so new, their achievement still so clear in living memory, the US just can't see what the rest of the world sees - that inequality so entrenched in the history of a state doesn't disappear in matter of decades; on the contrary, the baleful fruits of generations of inequality can be used to justify the very prejudice that promoted the inequality in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that the UK has room to be too superior. British people went off to win the west, and having won it imported slaves to make it pay. Later, we invited Afro-Caribbean men and women to come and work in Britain, at the jobs that didn't pay enough to attract the incumbent population. Our own history of racism may not have been formalised in a written constitution. But Britain is just like the US in its reluctance to admit that the casual, widespread racism of the past has far-reaching consequences that give succour to those who wish to be racists still. Our own Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is Stephen Lawrence. The awful depths of the hostility of the police to the idea of prosecuting his racist killers is still being revealed, 20 years on, as we learn how undercover officers gathered intelligence on the Lawrence family as they campaigned for justice for their son. Modern states that are worthy of the name are meant to protect their citizens from violence, protecting all of us equally, under the law. In the wake of 9/11 the US and Britain were the most active nations in the world in the quest to take up arms in the cause of spreading liberal democracy. Why neither nation is able to see why the targets of this largesse don't quite trust them, when both are still unable to spread liberal democracy with impunity even among their own citizens, is quite the little mystery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a little acknowledged fact, yet an unanswerable one, that states exist in great part to maintain a monopoly on violence, either through the activities of their armed forces or via the upholding of the law. The really disturbing thing about cases such as Martin's and Lawrence's is that they reveal how cavalierly states abuse this responsibility. The disconnect in the US can be seen more plainly than in Britain, because the US, as land colonised in recent history, maintains vigilantism as an integral part of its identity so avidly. That's what's at the root of its liberal gun laws - that's what killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of those moments when the US - and its great ally, the UK - would do well to take a long look at itself. Zimmerman's right to kill in &quot;self-defence&quot; does not contrast well with Edward Snowden's fear of retribution. By exposing the fact that the emails of the citizens of the land of the free (and in Britain) could be plucked from the internet at the state's leisure, wasn't Snowden too defending himself, his fellow citizens, and the idea of the US and of liberal democracy? But no reluctance to arrest Snowden is evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are told that this is all for our own protection - the fight against terrorism is an important part of the state's protection of its monopoly on violence. Yet, not for the first time in these troubled years since 9/11, one wonders how the US can have pretensions to being the world's policeman, when it doesn't even police its own citizens with impartiality. And one wonders how the US can believe that part of its purpose is to be a beacon of democracy and freedom throughout the world, when it clearly believes that it should be able to spy on the private lives of the world's citizens with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Martin case were &quot;just&quot; about racism, then that would be grotesque and awful enough. But it's even more basic than that. It's about the fragility of freedom, and how imperative it is that one person's freedom, like one community's, and one country's, cannot be pursued at the expense of another's. Zimmerman's freedom to get on with his own life has been won at the cost of another man's annihilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disregard of the idea that all US citizens have an equal right to freedom and protection could not be made more painfully obvious than this. A monopoly on violence is a terrifying monopoly to hold. It should quite definitely not be shared so casually with self-appointed men from the neighbourhood watch.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Dennis: I used to revere these two prominent black intellectuals. But lately, their critical voices have turned to crude Obama-bashing <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Cornel West and Tavis Smiley have let me down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cornel West and Tavis Smiley are undoubtedly two of the most important figures in black intellectualism and political action in my lifetime. West is probably the most important voice to have helped shaped African-American identity in recent years, and his Race Matters is one of the most necessary books in American history. As for Smiley, his unflinching news coverage and calls for political action were always measured and effective, especially in light of other, wannabe celebrity activists looking for their next book or endorsement deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why it pains me to say that Smiley and West have let me down. Sure, I'm not really anyone important to them, but I represent a generation of African-American men who looked up to West and Smiley - only to see them damage their legacies by engaging in embarrassing public roasts of President Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've looked up to Smiley and West since I was a teenager, gathering an appreciation for race relations and my own personal understanding my place in this country. I've always dreamed of having even a fraction of their respective impacts on American discourse. So I can't help but be disappointed when I see these two men relegated to bickering, insult-tossing self-parodies, especially when it comes to discussing the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West has called Obama a &quot;Rockefeller Republican in blackface&quot; and both recently criticized Al Sharpton's support of the president as an example of him being &quot;on the Obama's plantation&quot;. These inflammatory remarks only discredit whatever valid criticisms Smiley and West may have about how President Obama has conducted himself over the past five years. And that's a shame because the two men would otherwise have so much to offer the country as true intellectuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley and West were supposed to be two of the thinkers helping to place Obama's eight years in office in a wider context. They ought to have been our moral barometers, men who would advocate for the change Obama promised in 2008. With the spotlight on an African-American president and the state of race relations in this country, it was only natural that Smiley and West would shine, becoming iconic leaders their previous work seemed to prepare them for. So, for people like myself who grew up on the example they set, the spectacle of Smiley and West engaging in crude Obama-bashing is more embarrassing than inspiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that President Obama has been or should be above reproach. Count me in as one of the millions disappointed with the payoff of the &quot;change&quot; rhetoric from Obama's campaign. He and his administration have earned as much criticism as any other president before him. But he has also had triumphs, and that goes for his handling of race relations, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth about President Obama's effectiveness as a president lies objectively in the wide middle ground, up for debate between verdicts of total failure or flawless world-changer. Smiley and West, however, have only chosen to focus on the negatives of the president's actions, reaching for the lowest insults when they're not nearly called for. There's definitely a space to criticize the president, but potshots only neuter Smiley and West's ability to effectively point out Obama's flaws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, President Obama delivered a landmark speech in reaction to the George Zimmerman verdict. In his 17-minute speech, he broke down the problems facing black men in this country and articulated many of the vexed issues that explain why the Zimmerman verdict hit close to home for Americans like myself. The speech was widely celebrated in the black community and, from a personal aspect, was one of those pivotal moments I'll never forget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smiley and West didn't see it that way. West responded by pointing out how drone strikes make Obama a &quot;global George Zimmerman&quot;, while Smiley said the speech was &quot;weak as pre-sweetened Kool-Aid&quot; (whatever that means).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These comments are made only more disappointing because they seem to come from a place of personal disdain, more than any desire to push an intelligent discussion. West has gone on record saying his initial rift with President Obama came from the fact that he couldn't get tickets for his family to go to the inauguration. Smiley threw a tantrum in 2008 when President Obama couldn't make his State of the Black Union event (also saying &quot;no thanks&quot; to a proposal to have Michelle Obama come in his place).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two shots at the Smiley and West egos inform their rhetoric about the president, thrusting their &quot;criticism&quot; into the territory of &quot;bashing&quot;. Seriously, one of the foremost philosophers of our time has been insulting the leader of the free world because he didn't get a &quot;hook-up&quot;? Is that what's really important here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shame is that Smiley and West would have been in prime position to make legitimate criticisms of the president, calling for more action and amplifying the public's cries for the change we've been promised. Instead, to coin a phrase from my age group's vernacular, Smiley and West are just &quot;haters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was in college, I wanted to grow up to be Cornel West or Tavis Smiley. They had that sort of influence on me and millions of other young black Americans. Now, I see the way they're conducting themselves and I just feel sad about the opportunities they've wasted by letting pettiness and pride overshadow their desire to effect actual change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, Smiley and West can look at the recent backlash aimed in their direction and try to scale back the personal attacks. Perhaps, they can really lead deeper discussions about Obama's presidency and what it means for black America. But until that happens, they'll still be letting us down.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Enemy may be older and wiser but the fervent anger and kinetic tunes are just as agitated and shocking as ever, writes Ian Gittins <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-five years ago, the notion of a middle-aged Public Enemy appeared preposterous. Hip-hop's most militant group seemed defined by the inchoate rage of youth, the idealistic faith that a revolutionary restructuring of what they perceived as America's racist society could be willed into being by sheer righteous belief. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A generation on, they may be older and wiser but the fervent flame of anger has not dimmed. The names have changed but the story remains the same; where once Chuck D proselytised from the stage about Rodney King, tonight it is the modern morality tale of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin that exercises him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their miraculous achievement was always to make music as extreme, agitated and visceral as its radical lyrical content, and even today its serrated rage can shock. The aggregation of shrill sirens, deep-dub funk and testifying samples that make up Rebel Without a Pause still sounds astonishing, while the kinetic Don't Believe the Hype and Fight the Power are balls of tension, fingers jabbed hard into the solar plexus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Griff is absent tonight but, having missed Glastonbury due to &quot;immigration issues&quot;, the antic Flavor Flav is back. Capering across stage, surfing through the crowd and dedicating a clenched Bring the Noise to the new King George (to a chorus of boos), he remains the perfect slapstick foil to Chuck D's magisterial ire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first half of the set, typified by Chuck D drawing links between 2012 track Hoover Music and recent revelations about American government surveillance, is taut and thrilling. The second hour, featuring Flav playing a drum solo and inviting women on stage to &quot;shake their booty&quot;, is less so. Yet with hip-hop blighted by braggadocio and misogyny, Public Enemy remain a towering example of what it once was, and could be.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman has prompted many media pundits to question: Would Zimmerman have been acquitted if he were a black man and Martin were a white teenager? This is a rhetorical question, spoken only by those who wish to imply that a black man would be found guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an answer to this question, although most publications would prefer to ignore and bury the truth of the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look no further than the 2009 shooting of Christopher Cervini in central New York State. Cervini, an unarmed, white, 17 year-old teenager, was shot to death by Roderick Scott, a black man who was investigating car break-ins late one night in his neighbourhood. The state prosecutor attempted to convict Scott of manslaughter, despite the fact that he had acted in self-defence. He was acquitted by the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we've seen here with the Zimmerman case is a racially charged witch hunt. He's been painted as a racist and criminal, despite the accolades from a number of black people in his own community. Two weeks ago, Zimmerman assisted in saving a family from their overturned vehicle less than a mile away from where Trayvon Martin was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott and Zimmerman were acquitted for good reason. Self-defence is not a crime, no matter what colour skin an attacker may have. If we really want equality, certain pundits, activists and politicians must drop the race-baiting before it leads to serious cultural conflict. The so-called &quot;progressives&quot; who've spun this web of deceit are bringing us backward on race relations by categorizing everyone into racial clans for the express purpose of division and control.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Hackensack man convicted of kidnapping and raping a 13-year-old  girl while he was on parole for another child-sex conviction was  sentenced Thursday to life plus 24 years in prison.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;This is the third time this defendant has preyed on young girls,&quot;  state Superior Court Judge James Guida said of Ivan McKinney. &quot;This  defendant needs to be removed from society.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McKinney earlier had made an emotional statement saying he  maintained his innocence.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I stand before this court today as a man of journey,&quot; McKinney  said at his sentencing in Hackensack. &quot;I am not afraid of what is  going to happen, because I am a man on a journey.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    After the sentencing, he began screaming, &quot;I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin! I  am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin!&quot; and was hurried out of the courtroom by  sheriff's officers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Catherine Fantuzzi, an assistant Bergen County prosecutor,  described McKinney at his sentencing as &quot;a depraved, opportunistic,  recidivist rapist.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;It's not every day that a prosecutor requests a sentence of life  in prison for a case that doesn't involve a homicide,&quot; she said,  noting that McKinney victimized a total of six women in his three  convictions in the last five years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;The only way to truly protect society is to put him in prison for  the rest of his life,&quot; she said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Prosecutors said McKinney, 40, had been out of prison for just six  months and was already on parole for another child-sex conviction  in February 2011 when he befriended two Clifton girls, ages 13 and  15, in Passaic. Despite a parole condition that prohibited him from  being alone with children, he took the girls to his Hackensack  apartment on two occasions and gave them drugs and alcohol until  they passed out, prosecutors said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The first encounter was a &quot;dry run&quot; to see how the girls would  respond, said Fantuzzi.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    During the second encounter, McKinney had sex with the girls,  prosecutors said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A jury later found him guilty of kidnapping and sexually assaulting  the 13-year-old girl but acquitted him of the kidnapping and sexual  assault of the other girl. The jury also found him guilty of  several counts of child endangerment and possession of drugs with  intent to distribute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Having been convicted of sexual assault and child abuse in 2008 and  2010, McKinney was on lifetime parole at the time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    He must serve 54 years before he is eligible for parole.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    McKinney comes from a &quot;solid&quot; family of churchgoers, said his  attorney, Jeff Steinfeld. Nearly a dozen relatives, including  McKinney's parents, attended the sentencing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Steinfeld has said his client's conviction will be challenged on  appeal on several grounds. He said investigators obtained DNA  evidence, but that it pointed to a male other than McKinney. He  also said the alleged victims made inconsistent statements, and  that some of the jurors were sleeping during McKinney's trial.  Steinfeld additionally argued that McKinney should not be subjected  to a sentence longer than that given to murder convicts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;The court's sentence is but one of a multiplicity of significant  legal issues that will be vigorously pursued on appeal,&quot; Steinfeld  said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    A state law allows a judge to impose an extended term of  imprisonment -- New Jersey's version of a three-strikes law -- on  certain repeat offenders. Sex offenders who commit kidnapping,  sexual assault or child endangerment while on parole for another  sex offense fall into that category.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, says the family of the slain teenager is devastated by Robin Roberts' interview with a juror who thinks George Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29, who asked to be identified only as &quot;Maddy,&quot; broke her silence Thursday in an exclusive sitdown with Roberts, revealing that even though jurors felt Zimmerman &quot;was guilty&quot; of killing Martin, &quot;we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.&quot; While she &quot;fought to the end,&quot; she ultimately decided there was not enough proof that Zimmerman killed Martin with intent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with. [But] the law couldn't prove it,&quot; said Maddy, a 36-year-old Puerto Rican mother of eight and the only minority on the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the trial, she recalled, &quot;I felt like I let a lot of people down, and I'm thinking to myself, 'Did I go the right way? Did I go the wrong way?'&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STORY: Jay-Z, Beyonce Attend Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Rally in New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Thursday, Fulton responded: &quot;It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from juror B29, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true. That George Zimmerman literally got away with murder. This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child. That's why Tracy [Martin] and I have launched The Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Foundation to try and take something very painful and negative and turn it into something positive as a legacy to our son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, a neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Fla., was acquitted of second-degree murder earlier this month in the shooting death of the unarmed Martin, who was 17. The verdict sparked outrage from those who believe race had been a factor in Zimmerman's acquittal, with nationwide protests calling for justice for the black teen and President Obama giving an impromptu press conference, saying: &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first juror from the six-woman panel to come out of the woodwork was B37, who, without revealing her identity, gave an interview to CNN's Anderson Cooper last week saying that both Zimmerman and Martin's actions led to Martin's fatal shooting in February 2012. However, she said, Zimmerman did not break the law. Her remarks led four other jurors in the trial to issue a letterdistancing themselves from her statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox and Marvel's The Wolverine earned a strong $4 million as it began rolling out in North America at 10 p.m. Thursday, looking to end a losing run for big-budget tentpoles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie is on course to open in the $65 million to $70 million range domestically, one of the best showings of the summer. It should do even more business overseas, where it opens day-and-date in most of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, unlike other summer films, which opened at 7 p.m. Thursday, Wolverine didn't launch domestically until 10 p.m. Earlier this summer, World War Z grossed $3.6 million Thursday night on its way to a $66 million North American opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STORY: 5 Ways to Fix the Summer Movie Box-Office Crisis </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine was directed by James Mangold, with Hugh Jackman returning in the title role (the two worked together previously on the 2001 romantic adventure Kate &amp; Leopold). The film opens four years after X-Men spinoff X-Men Origins: Wolverine played in theaters, opening to $85.1 million in early May and grossing $373.1 million worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine's long-term outcome should be boosted by strong reviews; X-Men Origins was roundly bashed by critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set sometime after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan (Jackman) has renounced his superhero powers and is living as a recluse in the Yukon. However, he's drawn back into the world when a Japanese man he once saved requests to become immortal. He also asks that Logan protect his granddaugther.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox spent just under $120 million to make Wolverine after tax rebates, a fairly reasonable number for a superhero pic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wolverine is the only new major release this weekend. There is, however, a flurry of activity at the specialty box office, including the launch of Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine is six theaters in New York and Los Angeles. Sony Pictures Classics, Allen's longtime distribution partner, is releasing the film in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBS Films' raunchy comedy The To Do List, starring Aubrey Plaza, also opens in 591 theaters. The $1.5 million film is expected to do $2 million for the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other specialty films -- coming-of-age dramedy The Way, Way Back and Ryan Coogler's Fruitvale Station -- both expand nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STORY: Why Jeff Robinov Is Stuck in Executive Jail </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox Searchlight's The Way, Way Back, starring Steve Carell, Toni Colette and Sam Rockwell, expands from 304 theaters into more than 800. Directed by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, who wrote the script for The Descendants, the pic has earned a strong $4.6 million to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station, from The Weinstein Co., expands from 34 theaters into more than 1,000 in its third weekend after earning $1.3 million. The critically acclaimed film is prospering in both art house and African-American theaters and recounts the real-life shooting of an unarmed young black man by a BART police officer in Oakland. The film has drawn numerous parallels to the Trayvon Martin case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month marks the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington DC. Yet as America debates the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, it is clear that the nation's long conversation about race is far from over. And though President Barack Obama spoke in measured terms on news channels last Friday, on reality TV, that conversation remains raw. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBS is presently airing the 15th series of the US version of Big Brother. Historically, the network has shied away from showing its contestants' racist behaviour, often removing all trace of bigotry from the show's broadcasts - because, in the words of executive producer Allison Grodner, the programme-makers &quot;don't want to put hateful things out there&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This summer, however, avid viewers of Big Brother's internet livestream have spotted even more racial slurs than usual in the house. &quot;Why not show these people for who they actually are?&quot; demanded reality TV blogger Andy Denhart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network decided to make the issue a series motif, and has since offered its viewers a rare, extended study of casual racism at work. The main offender is Aaryn Gries, 22, a blonde Texan model who last week, for little or no reason, flipped the mat-tress of the sole black female housemate, Candice Stewart, and then goaded her in an apparently mocking accent, asking &quot;What you gon' do, girl?&quot; When Stewart vocally defended herself, she was confronted by another white contestant, GinaMarie Zimmerman (no relation), who yelled, &quot;You want the black to come out?&quot; Gries warned her allies to be careful of Stewart in the dark, &quot;because you might not see the bitch&quot;, and dismissed Asian-American contestant Helen Kim by telling her to &quot;go make some rice&quot;. Among other slurs, Zimmerman recently referred to welfare payments as &quot;n***** insurance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mattress incident ended only when Howard Overby, the only other black housemate, lifted Stewart and carried her from the room. As she wept in his arms, a visibly angry Overby urged her not to retaliate. There will be repercussions nonetheless: unbeknownst to them, Gries has been dropped by her modelling agency, and Zimmerman fired from her job as a pageant co-ordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it is not just the contestants who have been implicated. The approach of programme-makers is now under the spotlight, too. The producers of the Fox network's American Idol are being sued by 10 black former contestants, who claim they were targeted for ejection from the TV talent contest because of their race. According to TMZ, the contestants are demanding $25m each.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Division: A not-so-funny thing happened on the way to post-racial America. Under our first black president and &quot;Great Uniter,&quot; polling shows a serious worsening of race relations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember Los Angeles-based street artist Shepard Fairey's famous red, beige and blue Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster for the 2008 campaign? In the heady days of early 2009, the New Yorker magazine's art critic declared that Fairey had &quot;created the most efficacious American political illustration since &quot;Uncle Sam Wants You.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week before that grandiose pronouncement, the then-new attorney general of the U.S., Eric Holder, made his own grandiose remark: &quot;Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been, and we, I believe, continue to be, in too many ways a nation of cowards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder vowed back then that his Justice Department &quot;must and will leave the nation to the &quot;new birth of freedom' &quot; promised by Abe Lincoln. But what has happened in the 4-1/2 years of Obama and Holder since then? Race relations have gone into a free fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, the share of Americans who consider race relations &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;fairly good&quot; has plummeted from above 70% between 2009 and 2011 to only 52% today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most amazing is the poll's finding that just 38% of blacks in the U.S. -- in spite of America's first black president being re-elected less than a year ago -- hold a positive view of the current state of race relations. At the outset of Obama's presidency, by comparison, no doubt with Fairey's iconic, feel-good image in mind, nearly 80% of whites and some 63% of blacks had a favorable viewpoint on ties between the races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are the ingredients for racial combustion swirling dangerously together this midsummer? With the public still digesting George Zimmerman's exoneration on all charges in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a racially charged new offering from leading Hollywood lefty Harvey Weinstein is hitting movie houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; with Oscar written all over it, plays fast and loose with the facts of the shooting of unarmed black 22-year-old Oscar Grant by a white policeman in Oakland on New Year's Day 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every chance Barack Obama and Eric Holder get, they seem to pick at the nation's healing racial wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking sides against a jury's decision, the Great Uniter declared that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago,&quot; and later called for a national &quot;conversation&quot; on race -- code for &quot;endless lectures&quot; by the left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, meanwhile, this week defied a recent Supreme Court ruling by launching an attack on heavily Republican Texas' voter-ID laws. Yet the undeniable Black Panther voter intimidation in Philadelphia gets shrugged off by his Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also, of course, the tragic irony of black unemployment of close to 14% under the first black president,over six points above the general jobless rate of 7.6%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colors on that Obama poster have faded, sadly, with nonwhites the biggest victims of this divisive president's extreme policies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News in an interview made available Thursday that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the six-member, all-women jury. <BR>&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&quot; she said. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot; <BR>But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer of a crime. <BR>&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God,&quot; she said. &quot;And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&quot; <BR>Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 slaying of the unarmed 17-year-old. The Miami teenager was shot and killed during a confrontation with Zimmerman in Sanford. The case spawned heated national debates about racial profiling and the so-called Stand Your Ground self-defense laws in Florida and other states. <BR>Zimmerman was seen publicly for the first time last week when he assisted a family after their SUV flipped over on a Florida highway. <BR>Juror B29 is the second panelist to go public with what went on during deliberations earlier this month. She allowed her face to be shown and used her first name, Maddy, unlike Juror B37, who was interviewed on CNN last week with her face obscured. <BR>Four jurors, not including the one interviewed by ABC, issued a statement last week saying the opinions expressed by Juror B37 to CNN's Anderson Cooper did not represent their views. That juror said the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager's fatal shooting, but that Zimmerman didn't actually break the law. <BR>Juror B29 also told ABC that she didn't believe race was an issue at the trial. Though the judge so far has refused to release the names or biographical information about the jurors, B29 said she was 36 years old and Puerto Rican.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the seemingly disjointed fragments of news that maddeningly disrupt the steamy summertime tediousness are in fact interrelated - disturbingly so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purportedly enlightened campaign against Jewish circumcision and the equally sanctimonious outcry against kosher slaughter (most gallingly and recently in the very same Poland whose soil is soaked with Jewish blood as no other spot on this planet) are links in the same chain that led to the European Union's burgeoning anti-Israeli boycott (disingenuously hinged on the settlements pretext) and to US Secretary of State John Kerry's artificial resuscitation of the moribund and grossly misnamed peace process (that hinges on the release of convicted murderers whose hands drip with Jewish blood).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is that those who cannot abide ancient Jewish rituals for a variety of insincere excuses and who seek excuses to justify double standards against the Jewish state, stayed eerily silent when the Palestinian Authority demanded liberation for some of the most heinous perpetrators of hate crimes since the Holocaust (which Europe assiduously attempts to belittle). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No leading politician on the continent that presumes to set universal moral benchmarks had come up with even a marginal expression of discomfort. The apparent upshot is that there's always justice on the Palestinian/Arab side and that there can never be any justice on the Israeli/Jewish side. It's a built-in premise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus the construction of Jewish homes in Jerusalem - where Jews had resided for many centuries and where they had formed the solid overwhelming majority going back to Ottoman rule (long before the advent of Zionism) - is something which progressive Europe cannot abide. It's noteworthy that self-same Europe stayed remarkably calm when the Arab Legion violently violated the 1947 UN Partition Resolution and conquered the eastern half of Jerusalem. Due to the Arab 19-year-long occupation (1948-1967), east Jerusalem remained outside the green-tinted Armistice Line. Returning to the Arabs the fruits of their aggression is now the hallmark of Europe's quest for virtue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while a bank branch in a Jewish neighborhood beyond the hallowed Green Line outlaws any dealings with the entire financial institution, letting loose outright butchers doesn't so much as tickle those celebrated European sensibilities. Why? Given Europe's history it won't be a stretch to assume that it's the identity of the victims that matters. They were Jews and Europe quite routinely gets over the shedding of Jewish blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it weren't so, Europe should have howled with outrage at the very suggestion by the PA that such convicts as Abu Kharbish Salem Suleiman Mahmoud and Adham Ibrahim Jum'ah, both sentenced to life terms, be freed as the price of another chinwag with Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 30, 1988, this inglorious pair lobbed firebombs at a civilian bus - line 961 - heading from Tiberias to Jerusalem. Although incendiary devices aimed at Israelis are treated indulgently abroad, they're intended to cause grievous harm. They did just that to the bus on which 26-year-old Rachel Weiss traveled with her three sons - Nathaniel, Raphael and Ephraim - two toddlers and one baby. Rather than escape and save herself, Rachel tried to save her children but was engulfed in flames along with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Delarosa, a 20-year-old soldier, did manage to flee before he saw Rachel and the tots. He then turned back to help them but was himself critically wounded. Cpl. Delarosa succumbed to his agonizing injuries weeks later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the international community's icons of broadmindedness would have us believe that the cause of world harmony and fraternal goodwill would be best served if we set free those who with malice aforethought set out to burn innocent passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grisly nature of this crime (and others like it) as well as the identity of the victims are nowhere mentioned by any of the pompous pontificators who arrogantly preach to us. These details aren't negligible incidentals. Although the heart of the matter, they're deliberately obfuscated lest they highlight the clear pro-Arab bias of presumed impartial peace-promoters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it weren't so, liberals worldwide would ask why the ostensibly moderate PA insists on springing the worst murderers - the very ones Israel had refused to swap during all previous episodes. Why are the bloodiest sadists upheld by official PA propaganda as heroic role models for the young generation? Is the cause of peace boosted by glorifying the slayers of baby Jews? Does this perhaps betray the fact that the Palestinians don't genuinely yearn for coexistence but for an existence without Jews? Are Palestinians telling their own children that the only good Jews are dead Jews?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Europe be shocked? Should Kerry be dismayed? Should US President Barack Obama spare baby Ephraim Weiss a fraction of the emotion he lavished on Trayvon&nbsp;Martin? Should Obama wonder aloud how it feels to be Jewish and sense that the rest of the world considers you an expendable offering to the Moloch of whatever political correctness reigns at a given time and place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we better not hold our breath for Obama's heartfelt sympathy. He managed to say nothing after the 2011 Fogel family massacre and after one-year-old Yonatan Palmer was murdered with his father in a rock-throwing incident at a time in which Obama already resided in the White House. He likewise kept expediently mum following the dreadful life-altering injuries inflicted on three-year-old Adelle Biton a few months ago, during another roadside stoning-fest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Obama exerted excruciating pressure on Israel's democratically elected leadership (the only one of its sort in this otherwise despotic and fanatic region) to release unrepentant genocidal murderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This blows our collective mind on many levels. First is the fact that Israeli babies, attacked for no reason, appear not to deserve the empathy reserved for Trayvon in less unambiguous circumstances (to say the least).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, there are practical considerations. The premature release of bloodcurdlingly callous mass murderers isn't likely to daunt those indoctrinated to adulate them. The awareness that perpetrators of the most atrocious of homicides won't spend the rest of their days behind bars is likely to embolden their disciples. As with previous such releases, this one too will backfire brutally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then comes the whopping insult to our democracy and legal system. Our courts - autonomous as few others anywhere - deserve respect. Those whom Ramallah figurehead Mahmoud Abbas wants released to enhance his waning prestige aren't - contrary to impressions imparted by foreign media - persecuted &quot;prisoners of conscience,&quot; locked up because of their beliefs and gallant championship of freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These murderers were convicted after eminently fair trials with all the breaks of due process. They were granted legal representation replete with rights habitually denied defendants in Arab and Muslim countries, where instant kangaroo-court style rulings are the norm that the world blithely overlooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ignore this basic is to make a laughing stock of Israel's pedantic and ultra-liberal jurisprudence. All Israelis - especially those on the Left who make so much use of Israel's famous judicial interventionism - ought to be insulted to the core by this American insolence. It's unthinkable that our courts would be relied upon only when it suits a given agenda but that their decisions would be dishonored when it's so dictated by diplomatic exigencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Israeli verdicts and sentences are perennially set aside for Washington's misjudged moves, American clemency is withheld from Jonathan Pollard who harmed nobody and who has served more than anyone else had for an espionage offense like his. In Pollard's case, an inordinate sentence cannot be shortened, but the two who burned a young mother and her tiny boys deserve to have their sentence commuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this isn't hypocrisy, it's hard to pinpoint what is. It's also hard to avoid the conclusion that had Pollard or the Weiss family not been Jewish, attitudes would have been vastly different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what connects all those seemingly unconnected news reports. Minimal intellectual honesty compels us Jews to admit that we live in dangerous times - so dangerous that they cannot but remind us of the noxious atmosphere which led to the incomparable tragedy of the Holocaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never in its annals was the phoenix-like Jewish state - arisen from the ashes of incinerated Jewish multitudes - so defamed, so unaccepted by the so-called family of nations and so tossed in a terrifying tempest of ill-will. Never since the 1930s have we experienced isolation so suffocating and so ubiquitous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vulgar bigotry of thugs - whether brown-shirted or skin-headed or keffiah-wrapped - was and is facilitated by the ideologically honed vitriol of ostensibly exemplary, honorable sorts. They rationalize their abhorrence as decent and de rigueur. They were the ones who once made it possible for the storm troopers to terrorize and who now vindicate jihadist terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once more these self-professed spokesmen of erudition and free speech horrifyingly shout down and shut up the objects their scorn. They paint themselves as oppressed victims and slander Jews as ruthless oppressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Jews are called Israelis, their maligners can fend off accusations of anti-Semitism. Such accusations are anyhow brandished as proof of manipulative intent to silence all criticism of the Jewish state. Calculated circuitous reasoning eventually turns Jew-haters into righteous persecuted underdogs, while Israelis are cast as ferocious hounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World peace will supposedly be secured by restraining these hounds. Submissive Jews/Israelis are presumably assured the affections of do-gooder &quot;non-anti-Semites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, vulnerable Jews weren't ever loved Jews. In the 1930s Jews couldn't have been more powerless or compliant. Nonetheless, their utter helplessness won them no compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes our times so chillingly similar to the era that conceived and tolerated the Holocaust is the broad social respectability accorded Jew-bashing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It matters little if the pretext is the fake ogre which the Nazis called &quot;International Judaism,&quot; or the state which the Jews established so they would never be as defenseless again. What matters is that Jewish self-defense in the framework of the Jewish state is as persistently demonized as was the nonexistent cabal of the Elders of Zion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jewish self-preservation today is as illegitimate as it was then and assailing it is as bon ton as in those dark days before the great cataclysm. It's all connected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've had this theory about weathering the weather. If we talk a lot about how hot or cold it is, things seem worse. More than a few folks have the same theory about race relations. The more we talk about it, the worse it is. But here's what I know about the weather despite my theory. The mercury is unaffected by complaint or conversation. It's still hot or cold. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, President Barack Obama tried to explain why African-American reactions to the not-guilty verdict in the Trayvon Martin case appear so full of raw emotion. He explained about context, how the history most know and the shared experiences not all do, inform how many African-Americans interpret the verdict. The president spoke in personal terms, how he has shared some of the experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These amount to suspicion that you are &quot;up to no good&quot;   just because you are who you are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Americans, I'm guessing, were proud the president would attempt to bridge this gap. But, of course, there are those who heard the president's remarks and instantly regarded him as divider-in-chief. These folks apply my theory of weather to race relations but believe that talking about race relations raises the temperature. In fact, if you talk about it, you're a race-baiter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president invited scrutiny of the statistics, the &quot;facts&quot; that some use to buttress their perceptions of blacks. Why are these statistics so out of kilter for some groups? Would Martin, had he lived, been able to legally stand his ground? Why, since rates of drug use are roughly equal between blacks and whites, are blacks far more likely to be charged and go to prison for drug crimes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This charge of race-baiting goes something like this: If you write or speak about racism, you are picking sides and hate whites. You are, therefore, racist. But this is really saying this: Shut up, you're making me uncomfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a defense mechanism that often compels its user to reduce complaints about racial unfairness to an alleged yen for victimhood and prompts overdrawn assumptions about lack of personal responsibility. But what those intolerant of calling out intolerance are also saying is that they find it difficult, nigh on to impossible, to imagine what it's like to walk in other people's shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president was making a plea for understanding. But he was also making a plea for something absent in a whole lot of public policy discussions. Empathy. The president is not saying whites are racist. He was trying to tap that well-known American trait of fairness. Not everyone has shared those experiences and history is more abstract for some than others. He was tacitly acknowledging that, while racism on the individual level is widely viewed as contemptible, it still has a home in our institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the weather, racial issues might actually be helped by talking about them. So, hey, how 'bout that racial climate? Let's talk about why it's hotter for some and why others are more often left out in the cold.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must do better on health</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As thousands of Monterey Bay workers and families participate in nonprofit insurance plans, UNITE HERE Local 483 has deep concerns about the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the law creates an incentive for employers to keep employees' hours below 30 hours a week to avoid health care obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the Affordable Care Act excludes participants in nonprofit health plans like ours from receiving subsidies for which their income level qualifies them. The subsidies will go primarily to a few for-profit insurance plans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, not only are we excluded from receiving premium subsidies, nonprofit plans will be taxed to benefit for-profit plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restrictions will make nonprofit plans unsustainable, and will rid the health care market of viable alternatives to the big health insurance companies. As it stands, the ACA will be a multibillion-dollar tax expansion going directly to benefit for-profit health plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president promised those of us who like our health care plan would be able to keep it. That promise will be broken, unless the president or Congress makes common-sense corrections to these problems. Millions of Americans will be hurt by the health care law intended to help them, unless we do better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hector H. Azpilcueta<BR>Vice president, UNITE HERE local 483</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better ways to allocate money for homeless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see that thecity of Monterey has taken $40,000 out of the budget and allocated it for homeless charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also considering different ideas for homeless parking in Monterey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $40,000 should go directly to the Salvation Army. If you look at its website, it provides food, washing, clothing, counseling, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city should provide a bus ticket to help get them there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any idea of providing parking is going to create a problem and it will get worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why don't we ask local business to give an option to donate at the checkout? I would gladly do so to a worthy homeless charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the same time, please, please do something about the panhandlers!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am sick to death of dodging a flying cup every time I go to Walgreens and seeing the piles of trash on the open space on the corner of Soledad Drive and Munras Avenue!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way, why are these panhandlers not waiting outside Home Depot for work like the immigrants do?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman finds unlikely allies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was rather refreshing to get emails from my friends on the right who finally took a break from blaming Latins for almost everything wrong in America to jumping to their defense in the name of the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's face it, the George Zimmerman that appeared in the Florida courtroom with hair on his head and none on his face looked quite different than the one with shaven head and scruffy beard chasing Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he had been following some of these same guys in anything but a truck full of lawnmowers, Zimmerman may have heard a few shots ring out that weren't from his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the same guys that say that the girl who was raped deserved it because she was wearing short shorts and a low-cut blouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How dare a 17-year-old black kid wear a hoodie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right thing for Martin to do was to ignore the scary-looking skinhead following him and skedaddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor Zimmerman can only hope that they don't move him to Arizona, where that sheriff will say &quot;Zimmerman? that's funny you don't look like a Zimmerman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lew Goodkin<BR>Carmel Valley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racists come in many colors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see that a few readers of The Herald have taken umbrage withmy reference in a previous letter to George Zimmerman being half-Hispanic and half-Jewish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father is ethnically Jewish, but a Catholic by choice, certainly not unlike a lot of ethnic Jews who have embraced Christianity. I am 100 percent Jewish and yet I choose to be an atheist. Is the fact I am atheist make me less Jewish?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My skin color is what would be considered Caucasian, but we ethnic Jews are not Caucasian by strict definition. Therefore, by extension, George Zimmerman is not &quot;white,&quot; he is by consensus of ethnology a man of color, just as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was a man of color. Therefore, the killing of Martin by Zimmerman is a crime of color on color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism was not invented by any specific ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism is not what whites do to people of color, it is what every ethnic group does to every other ethnic group. There are black racists and Hispanic racists and Arab racists and Jewish racists and Asian racists and white racists and so forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Greenleaf<BR>Big Sur</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Letter not a defense of religious terrorism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suggestion thatmy letter , which included a brief list of various acts of religious terrorism, was in any way a defense of Islamic terrorism clearly shows which religious tunnel the other writers' look through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Schieding<BR>Seaside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civilians still caught in crossfire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Americans, including some recent Herald letter writers, have a blind spot when it comes to recognizing what exactly is an act of &quot;terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of that ignorance, they feel justified stating there is only one religion at this time in history   Islam   which commits acts of terrorism. This conveniently overlooks the actions of the only country in the world with military bases and soldiers all across the globe, which bombs Muslim nations on a regular basis killing numerous civilians in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hint: That particular country happens to be a predominantly Christian one. Of course, the American media wouldn't think of labeling such aggression by our country (remember &quot;shock and awe&quot;?) as &quot;terrorism.&quot; But whether killed by a suicide bomber or sniper, a uniformed soldier or an unmanned drone, the innocent civilian ends up just as dead.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caring about a headline can be hard. It's a blunt piece of information detached from an emotional experience. It sits there on the page, daring you to care about someone you knew nothing about, in a place far removed from the place you call home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Oscar Grant III died in the early hours of New year's day in 2009, he went from an invisible citizen to a newspaper headline. And then he became a national martyr. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grant was involved in a skirmish, handcuffed and eventually shot while lying face down on a subway platform by a transit cop. The incident was recorded by dozens of onlookers, and shortly after the images went viral, Oakland and San Francisco erupted in mass protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Oscar Grant appeared to be race-related because the white officer was in no danger, yet he shot Grant in the back saying that he mistook his revolver for his Taser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole sad story feels a little too familiar in the wake of the Trayvon Martin trial, and if it weren't for ryan Coogler's transcendent piece of cinema in Fruitvale Station, it would be easy to shut down altogether and stay in headline mode - processing the bleak news of the world through anesthetized senses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler's story wakes us up one tingle at a time, but it actually begins in the blur of the viral moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station opens with the cellphone footage of Grant's death as it took place, for real, in the public eye. It's grainy and shaky, but there's no mistaking what we're seeing: A group of African-American males being handcuffed by the Bay Area rapid Transit police. There are loud voices, some yelling, some laughing, and then, a gunshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this pixelated moment lacking any sense of detail, Coogler begins to round out the corners and fill in the jagged boxes with the kind of affectionate attention reserved for monks illuminating manuscripts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler painstakingly recreates the last day of Grant's life in this Sundance-winning feature debut, and while the ending is known from the moment the film begins, it's impossible to turn away or retreat into the numb zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler hooks us with Grant's charismatic personality, as well as the micro dramas currently unfolding in his relatively young life - from the romantic friction with his girlfriend and the mother of his young daughter, Sophina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Melonie diaz), to his struggle with unemployment and his criminal past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most movies, small-time players such as Oscar Grant are relegated to the fringes of the frame, where they utter expletives and fill out the background of the prison yard after being questioned by the hero cop for information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Coogler's vibrant and throbbing frame, Grant stands tall at the very centre, quickly assuming all the proportions of a standard screen hero - despite the status quo notion that people such as Grant are somehow less interesting, or entirely disposable, as a result of their lowly place in the social order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of this human victory is the direct result of Michael B. Jordan's (Chronicle) presence in the lead role. Handsome, charming and thoroughly fluid in the role, Jordan articulates the internal conflict as Grant's macho needs bump against his paternal, nurturing instincts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a caring father, and a devoted partner, but Grant is also a good-looking twentysomething man with raging hormones and a criminal past. He's struggling to stay on track, and Coogler develops a complex emotional portrait as he plays out various scenarios that force Grant to decide what kind of man he wants to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every one of them is small scale, but they're all fundamentally important because Coogler clearly understands life is nothing more than a cumulative expression of every decision we make - whether it's helping a random stranger, or turning your back on the easy cash of a drug sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Coogler sees the grey tones in every encounter, the movie never feels preachy or manipulative. Shot cinema v&eacute;rit&eacute;-style using natural light and the real locations, Coogler's frames feel entirely authentic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood only finds more momentum through performances by diaz, Octavia Spencer and Trestin George, who give Jordan's protagonist a textured surface to explore in every scene. No one is alone here, except for the very end, when Grant is suddenly separated from the people who give his life meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vulnerability and alienation of his final moments are part of what make the tragedy so heartbreaking because to the white cops, Grant is just another black man in a hoodie - a threat, a &quot;social problem,&quot; and something &quot;that needs to be dealt with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler's film creates more than just a complete picture of Grant's last day, it paints a whole canvas of the African-American experience without the sledgehammer scars of a Spike Lee joint, or the suspect saintliness of a Beasts of the Southern Wild.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beautifully human at every level, and visually poetic without a hint of pretense, Fruitvale Station isn't just one of the best films of the year, it may well be the most important. .</SPAN></P>

Jones narrates this history of Jacob's Pillow, the dance center founded in the 1930s by the choreographer Ted Shawn on a farm in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts, and its storied annual festival. The film's director, Ron Honsa, intersperses performances by the likes of Chunky Move, Shantala Shivalingappa, and, above, Kellye Saunders with interviews with Suzanne Farrell, Bill Irwin, Rasta Thomas, Frederic Franklin, Mark Morris, Merce Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Judith Jamison and Nikolaj Hubbe. ''The dances themselves are entertaining, and the cameras occasionally catch that electrifying moment just before a performer heads onstage,'' David DeWitt wrote in The New York Times about this film, now a ''Great Performances'' presentation. ''The rehearsals let the viewers play spy.'' Still, he said, ''this film has the everyday vibe of a bunch of friends putting together a summer camp video. Gosh, the substance of Jacob's Pillow should be a little less sleepy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 A.M. (Fox News) FOX &amp; FRIENDS Bret Michaels performs on the ''All-American Summer Concert Series.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 P.M. (FX Movie Channel) BOY ON A DOLPHIN (1957) Phaedra (Sophia Loren, in her English-language debut), a sponge diver, and her boyfriend, Rhif (Jorge Mistral), discover a gold-and-bronze statue thought to have mystical powers on a sunken vessel off the island of Hydra and try to sell it against the Greek government's wishes, in this adaptation from Jean Negulesco of the novel by David Divine. Alan Ladd plays the American archaeologist who wants the couple to donate the sculpture to a museum; Clifton Webb is the aesthete who covets it -- and Phaedra -- for himself. ''The outcome of this benign struggle is clear almost from the start,'' A. H. Weiler wrote in The Times. ''Jean Negulesco, who also was responsible for 'Three Coins,' and the rest of his troupe, did not waste color film. The trip paid off in fine, unusual, exotic and beautiful footage for this first American company to shoot in Greece.'' Ms. Loren, he added, appeared ''as decorative as any classic statue.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 P.M. (TCM) FRIDAY NIGHT SPOTLIGHT: THE FILMS OF FRAN&Ccedil;OIS TRUFFAUT The final installment in a monthlong tribute to this film critic turned director and mainstay of the French New Wave begins with ''Day For Night'' (1973), in which Truffaut portrays a film director struggling to complete a movie while coping with various crises among his cast members (including actors played by Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud, right) and crew. The lineup continues with ''The Last Metro'' (1980), at 10, about a beautiful actress (Catherine Deneuve) who hides her Jewish husband (Heinz Bennent) in the theater they run during the Nazi occupation while falling in love with an actor (G&eacute;rard Depardieu) performing onstage; ''The Wild Child (1970), at 12:15 a.m., in which a doctor (Truffaut) tries to civilize a boy (Jean-Pierre Cargol) raised in the wilderness by wolves; and ''The Story of Ad&egrave;le H.''

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo Galleries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Forum at Greater Friendship Baptist Church</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to teach our young men that it's very different being raised in this society,&quot; Collins said during a forum Thursday night at Greater Friendship Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was recently acquitted of a second-degree murder charge in Trayvon's death in Sanford, justifying his use of deadly force when he shot the teen as they struggled on a rainy night in February 2012. Martin's death and Zimmerman's acquittal have sparked rallies, meetings, marches and other gatherings all over the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday night's forum was hosted by the local NAACP chapter and the Daytona Beach Black Clergy Alliance, and moderated by Bethune- Cookman University senior policy adviser Claudette McFadden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Collins, members of the forum included the Rev. L. Ronald Durham, president of the Daytona Beach Black Clergy Alliance, Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry, Daytona Times writer James Harper, B-CU Student Government Association Vice President Reuben Rifin, local NAACP president Cynthia Slater, B-CU provost and chief academic officer Makola Abdullah, attorney Eddie Bell and Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McFadden's first question to the group was what they hoped to contribute to the discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durham said he wanted it to be clear that Zimmerman should be held accountable, there is a problem with Florida's &quot;stand-your- ground&quot; law and there should be civil rights for all people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not yet reached the dream that Dr. King talked about,&quot; Durham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henry wanted to stress the importance of looking at policy makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Policy makers respond to pressure,&quot; Henry said. &quot;If the policies don't change, this event could easily happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitwood said he believes the stand-your-ground law is a problem, but what he really wants people to realize is the danger of allowing violence to flourish in the community by not speaking up with information about crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow our young people to be gunned down in the streets,&quot; Chitwood said. &quot;It eats away at our souls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When McFadden asked the panel what profiling means to them and if they could cite an example, Bell said Volusia County was the birthplace of profiling and cited former Sheriff Bob Vogel's profiling methods against drug couriers on Interstate 95 when he served as a Florida Highway Patrol trooper during the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell followed that up with advice, which other panel members would echo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't fight your legal battles on the street,&quot; Bell said. &quot;We don't have to fight with them or get belligerent, but we have to hold them accountable for those things (profiling).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, brother of civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton, arrived at the forum as part of the Walk for Dignity, a six-day walk from Jacksonville to Sanford put together by Southern community organizations, and addressed everyone in the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a change that's in the air and in the atmosphere,&quot; Glasgow said. &quot;Stand in the way, and you will get run over.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By George Bennett   Palm Beach Post Staff Writer </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Democratic state senator in 2005, Nan Rich joined in a unanimous vote to create Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a candidate for governor eight years later, Rich is trying to capitalize on Democratic outrage over the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stand your ground law is broken. Until it's fixed, justice will never be fully served in Florida courts,&quot; Rich wrote in a recent appeal for campaign contributions. &quot;As governor, I would immediately call the Legislature back into session and hold them there until they closed the loopholes in this law that allow criminals to get away with murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich, who also plans to attend a sit-in protest against the law in Tallahassee on Saturday, said there's nothing inconsistent about her stance. She said the law is being implemented in ways she and her colleagues did not intend and it's common for legislators to revisit laws they have made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law has become an emotional rallying point for Democrats and their allies in the wake of the 2012 shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. As a political issue, it has the potential to drive minority voters to the polls in 2014 to register their dissatisfaction with Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who supports the law and has rejected calls to convene a special session to change it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversations with Rich and other Democrats who supported the law in 2005 show a range of views, some of which might not fit neatly onto a placard at a sit-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich's fundraising email came less than a week after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in Martin's death. Although her pitch for campaign money seems timed to cash in on fresh anger over the verdict, Rich said in an interview that she doesn't believe stand your ground was crucial in the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From what I've read, I don't think that stand your ground was determinant in terms of the jury verdict,&quot; Rich said. &quot;In the (jury) instructions, stand your ground was mentioned, but I believe it was based on the self-defense laws that are part of our statutes and they couldn't prove the charge. ... That doesn't change the fact that stand your ground needs to be changed, even though I don't believe that that's what the verdict was based upon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aronberg: Fix law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, who voted for the law as a Democratic state senator in 2005, continues to support the overall intent of the law but says some aspects of it should be &quot;fixed.&quot; He, too, said he doesn't believe stand your ground was a significant factor in the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Miami, also voted for stand your ground as a state senator in 2005 but has since introduced a bill in Congress to withhold federal transportation money from the approximately two dozen states that have such laws. Wilson was not available this week to discuss her changed position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rod Smith, a former prosecutor and Democratic state senator who was later the chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, said he'd support smoothing out some procedural aspects of the stand your ground law, but not its substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People say to me, 'Would you vote the same way?' I would,&quot; said Smith. He said the law, which he helped write, removed an unfair burden on a victim to retreat when facing an attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate unanimous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida legislators in 2005 voted 39-0 in the Senate and 94-20 in the House to expand the definition of the justifiable use of force in state statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;castle doctrine&quot; permitted deadly force against someone unlawfully and forcibly entering a person's home or vehicle, but the 2005 revision says &quot;a person who is not engaged in unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Language was added to two other sections of the justifiable force statutes to specify that a person &quot;does not have a duty to retreat&quot; if he or she reasonably believes deadly force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The intent of the legislation was to make sure that people had a right to protect themselves without having to retreat in the face of a life-or-death situation,&quot; Aronberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aronberg said legislators should revisit at least two portions of the law in response to court rulings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2005 law says a person using justified force is immune from criminal prosecution, including being arrested and detained in custody. That provision was intended to apply only when there was no dispute over the facts of a case, Aronberg contends. If facts are in dispute, Aronberg said, legislators envisioned a stand your ground claim being argued as part of the defense during a trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruling in 2010</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Florida Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that when facts surrounding a stand your ground claim are in dispute, a defendant claiming immunity is entitled to a pretrial hearing to resolve factual questions and potentially prevent a case from going to trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe it was the Legislature's intent to create a pretrial immunity based on a preponderance of the evidence,&quot; Aronberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aronberg also said lawmakers should clear up ambiguity created by a recent appellate court decision that allowed a felon in illegal possession of a gun to make a stand your ground claim. While a key portion of the stand your ground law specifies that it applies to a person &quot;not engaged in an unlawful activity,&quot; the appeals court noted that other sections of the justifiable force statutes do not include that limitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appellate ruling goes beyond the intent of legislators, said Aronberg. He pointed to language in the preamble to the 2005 legislation that says the Legislature &quot;finds that it is proper for law-abiding people to protect themselves. ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither of those changes would apply to the Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground did not decide this case,&quot; Aronberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Tremendous effect'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Minority Leader Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, disagreed with Aronberg's interpretation. &quot;It's in the jury instructions. ... It had a tremendous effect,&quot; said Smith, who voted against the law as a House member in 2005 and has led recent efforts to get the law changed. Even considering the law's &quot;tremendous&quot; impact, Smith said, it's not clear that a jury would have convicted Zimmerman under the pre-2005 self-defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith said he wants to eliminate the section of the law granting immunity from detention and arrest if a shooting is deemed justified. That provision prevented police from arresting Zimmerman just after the shooting, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to give more of an option to law enforcement if there are questionable circumstances,&quot; Smith said. He also wants to change a portion of the justifiable force statutes that he said gives too much leeway to an aggressor in a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By making changes, we send a message to Floridians about a code of conduct,&quot; Smith said. Even if the changes don't win approval, Smith said, debating them would have a benefit. &quot;Having hearings and discussing it will at least send a message to every other vigilante that that type of behavior is not encouraged.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oregon state officials have taken a bold step toward solving the tuition problem for students trying to attend public universities. With the state's new &quot;Pay it Forward, Pay it Back&quot; plan, approved this month, needy students will pay nothing while in school, and then only 3 percent of their income for the next two decades after getting a four-year degree. Those who attend for a shorter time would pay a prorated amount. Although this plan is in use in other countries, it has never been tried here. What a wonderful way to solve the high tuition costs at these universities. Let's hope educators and legislators in Pennsylvania take note. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sad reflections on a city mugging</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While I was walking home recently on a quiet residential block in Center City, 10 young, African American boys on bikes rode past. I thought nothing of it until two minutes later, when I was on the ground, with a bike on top of me, and a little boy looking as terrified as me trying to steal my belongings, fists raised. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am 31 years old and five months pregnant with my first child. My husband and I are proud to raise our family in the diverse culture of the city, and have always stood against racial profiling. Over the past few months, our beliefs had been reinforced in light of the tragic situation involving George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin. But as I am about to become a first-time mom, I am questioning so many of my beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm not angry at the mugger; not even really scared. I'm just sad - sad that I'm about to raise a baby among people who would hurt a pregnant woman. I'm sad that I don't know how to teach my child that stereotypes aren't real when something like this happens. I'm sad that, in such a diverse city, the disparities of class and race are widening, not shrinking. And I'm most sad for the boy who knocked me over (and his friends who just stood there). With so much anger, so much hate, and a propensity to commit violence against me (and my giant belly), in what direction is his life heading? </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trouble starts on the home front</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one will honestly address the heart of the problem: young black women having babies they can't afford (&quot;Unity was Obama's goal,&quot; July 23). At the rate of 73 percent, black babies are born to single parents. So, many men grow up unsupervised and undisciplined, and become involved in the criminal justice system. Instead of pointing fingers in every other direction - or to the past for even more excuses - black leaders should address the real issue. That problem links all of the others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia is fighting &quot;the way of the gun&quot; and striving to end violence, especially among African American boys and men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was the message Thursday at a City Hall news conference held by leaders of various city departments who pledged to work collaboratively to make the city safer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The way of the gun is not the way of a successful life,&quot; said Richard Negrin, the city's managing director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Picking up a gun offers a young person the kind of power &quot;you can get drunk on - the power of life or death,&quot; Negrin continued. &quot;That's what we're fighting. How do we get a kid to feel powerful without the gun?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is at the core of the city's efforts to &quot;get behind the problem of violence,&quot; Negrin said. &quot;We're not going to arrest our way out of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If gun violence is to be abated, officials said, the city requires a long-term, holistic approach that addresses poverty, joblessness, and the disproportionate likelihood that young African American males will be the victims and perpetrators of crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayor Nutter, who did not attend the meeting, issued a statement about the city's multifaceted approach to combating crime, which includes coordinating with the Department of Human Services:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know a true crime-fighting strategy cannot only focus on policing and incarceration. . . . The programs and initiatives in which we are engaged are interrelated and focused on the same goal: reducing crime with a focus on decreasing the number of young black male casualties in our city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been some success. Homicides in Philadelphia between January and the end of June this year were at a 50-year low of 115, police figures show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As reasons for the improvement, Nutter, along with criminal-justice experts, pointed to a greater emphasis on data-driven policing, a crackdown on gun criminals, and major reforms in criminal courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, police and prosecutors have targeted neighborhoods seen as hot spots of crime, including North Philadelphia's 22d Police District.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one point during Thursday's session, Everett Gillison, Nutter's chief of staff and the deputy mayor for public safety, brought up Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, the 17-year-old African American youth shot to death by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch member in Florida. Zimmerman was recently acquitted in the killing, touching off demonstrations around the country about the victimization of black youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the last 30 days, the country experienced quite a shock to its system,&quot; Gillison said. He added that the shooting and subsequent acquittal &quot;calls us to ask ourselves, what are we doing to make sure there are no more Trayvons?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHILE I WAS ON furlough, the Zimmerman verdict dropped like an anvil on a crate of eggs, followed by the reaction to the verdict, then the reaction to the reaction. There were rallies in some big cities, scattered vandalism, but thankfully nothing like the 1992 Rodney King riots. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the reaction to the reaction came seepage, like water leaking through a dam, creating a lake stocked with the usual fish of societal wrongs and collective failures. Most translated, effortlessly, to: It's the fault of the majority.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I couldn't read everything - who could? - but I read a lot, and the most passionate column came from my colleague Helen Ubi&amp;ntilde;as, who called us out, challenged us, got in our faces and accused us of not caring much about dead black kids. &quot;At the very least,&quot; she wrote, &quot;let's finally own that we don't care enough.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess I'm guilty, but how much is enough? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the black community care enough when police investigations into shootings are met with the silence of a &quot;no-snitch&quot; culture? Who owns that? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do I create positive change? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love mankind,&quot; wrote Charles Schulz. &quot;It's people I can't stand.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am the opposite. I feel for people who get lost or get harmed - especially innocent ones caught in the crossfire. It's the sociopaths living out their gangsta dreams I have no time for. Most are beyond redemption. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Clinton once said there's nothing that's wrong with America that can't be fixed by what's right with America. I feel there's nothing that's wrong with the black community that can't be fixed by what's right with the black community. That's where it must start. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand the linkage between poverty and crime, but I don't see the same murder rate in poor white neighborhoods. Writing in Time, Mayor Nutter said 75 percent of Philadelphia's murder victims are black and 80 percent of those charged with murder are black. Who owns that? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been other violent episodes in America's history, but none lasting so long and rarely so flagrant, with gangstas nonchalantly spraying rec centers, basketball courts and city streets with semiautomatic fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of you will call me racist, but facts are facts. The No. 1 cause of death of young black males is homicide. The killers are not Klansmen nor cops nor Town Watch white Hispanics. They are other young black males. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If violence flows from poverty, hopelessness, ignorance and social dysfunction, there is a success formula, an equation of pluses and minuses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plus: education, work, marriage, family. In that order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minus: drugs, guns, unprotected sex, thug culture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of you will call me conservative for pushing &quot;simplistic&quot; family values, but do you have a better plan? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help from organizations such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the NAACP is welcome, but I think a bottom-up approach is better than top-down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know that many individual African-Americans do care and put their asses on the line. There aren't enough of them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2007, after the &quot;10,000 Men: A Call to Action&quot; meetup, I wrote about the Brotherhood of Huntingdon Street, 20 black men who returned to the 'hood to help black kids. I mentioned them again in 2011, asking for help from the community - and they got some, thanks to Daily News readers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what I can do, and will do, is turn the spotlight on African-Americans working from the bottom-up to save their kids. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What can you do? If you marched for Trayvon Martin, but haven't mentored a black child or volunteered in a black school or charity, have you done enough? </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDRESSING black-on-black violence must be a priority for the city and the nation, Mayor Nutter's chief of staff said at a news conference at City Hall yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Race - it's the unanswered question for us as a society,&quot; Everett Gillison said, referencing the recent Trayvon Martin case in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillison was among top Nutter-administration officials who gathered to highlight the city's &quot;holistic approach&quot; to fighting crime, which has decreased dramatically in the first half of the year in several key areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Managing Director Rich Negrin said no one was &quot;dancing in the end zone&quot; over the new numbers, homicides have fallen 30 percent since this time last year. The well-attended event featured little new information and was designed to showcase the city's existing anti-crime tactics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillison said the administration's philosophy in fighting crime is to collaborate across departments to address the issue holistically and engage the entire community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dialogue works; collaboration works,&quot; Gillison said. &quot;We are a national model for this type of engagement.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at the event were city officials for education, public safety, human services and the Police Department. City Councilman Curtis Jones Jr. also spoke. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One program highlighted at the event was the Violence Prevention Collaborative, which pulls resources from the police department, the Department of Human Services and Family Court to prevent crime in the 22nd Police District in North Philly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nutter, who has no scheduled public appearances this week, was not at the event. Nutter spokesman Mark McDonald said the mayor has been &quot;with his family&quot; recently. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McDonald declined to say whether the mayor was out of town on vacation. He said city officials can reach him on his BlackBerry. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; leaves no doubt about what's to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It opens with grainy cell phone video of police officers forcing an unarmed black man to the ground on a subway station platform in Oakland, Calif., as incredulous or alarmed onlookers shout, &quot;Let him go,&quot; &quot;Protect and serve&quot; and &quot;Hey, come on, man!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The handcuffed man is forced face down as a white officer draws a weapon and fires the shot that will be heard 'round the Bay Area and then the nation. It kills 22-year-old Oscar Grant on New Year's Day 2009 and triggers protests that would be echoed, on a larger scale, after the death of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; goes beyond the headlines and heartache and shows Grant as a son, boyfriend, doting father, drug dealer who served prison time, and a man trying to start the new year with a fresh slate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director-writer Ryan Coogler moves from the video to the earliest minutes of Dec. 31, 2008, with Michael B. Jordan (&quot;Parenthood,&quot; &quot;Friday Night Lights,&quot; &quot;The Wire&quot;) playing Oscar. We know we are watching a dramatization of his final hours, which makes even the happiest moments bittersweet or shadowed by dread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oscar's girlfriend, Sophina (Melonie Diaz), suspects him of seeing an old flame but he pledges his love and loyalty to her and their 4-year-old daughter, Tatiana (Ariana Neal). He calls his mother (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer, &quot;The Help&quot;) to wish her a happy birthday, heads to a supermarket and goes out of his way there to be kind and charming to a stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The balance of the day is consumed with normal activities made abnormal by the fact that he will not have the luxury of doing them again, from picking up his child from preschool to weighing a trip to San Francisco to watch fireworks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A suggestion to stay safe by taking BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, sounds so reasonable but proves so fateful when a scuffle dumps Grant onto that platform where his life will be cut short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Coogler was living in the Bay Area when Grant was shot, and he, like countless others, watched the video of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wanted to go beyond the saint-or-sinner divide about Oscar although he probably tilts the scale by casting someone of Mr. Jordan's tremendous talent and charisma in the lead along with 6-foot-6 Kevin Durand as one of the BART officers alongside Chad Michael Murray. The names of both transit officers were changed for the film, but no attempt is made to explore or scrutinize them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; is not a documentary but a fictional portrait of a 22-year-old whose death left his daughter without a dad, his girlfriend without a partner, his mother without a son, and his grandmother without one of her grandchildren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a hole punched in the ice, the cracks spread, and they reached 2013 where moviegoers realized &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; opened or was about to open as news of George Zimmerman's acquittal arrived. Separated by circumstances, 3 years and 2,900 miles, the cases are part of the national conversation on race that moves in fits and starts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; runs just 84 minutes, long enough to put a face and family on a man whose daughter asks a simple question in the opening hours of 2009 -- &quot;Where's Daddy?&quot; -- for which there is no easy answer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- Efforts by television networks to stop the Dish Network from supplying its customers an automatic ad-skipping device were dealt another setback Wednesday when a federal appeals court declined to issue a preliminary injunction against Dish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's ruling last fall and lent further support to Dish as it markets the Hopper, a digital video recorder that comes with the ad-skipping feature, which has the potential to undermine the television advertising business. The Fox network, which sought the initial injunction and then appealed, said it was disappointed by the second loss in court and would &quot;review all of our options.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- A Halliburton Co. unit will plead guilty to destroying tests on cement work done on a BP-owned oil well that exploded and caused the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, federal prosecutors said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of Halliburton Energy Services Inc., which worked on BP's Macondo well, will plead guilty on the unit's behalf to one count of destroying evidence for failing to preserve computer models examining the final cement job on the well after the April 2010 explosion that killed 11 workers and sent millions of barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf, the Justice Department said in a statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT MEADE, Md. - A defense attorney for Pfc. Bradley Manning says the soldier is a whistleblower who wanted the American public to know about the awful things he saw as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney David Coombs delivered his closing arguments today in Pvt. Manning's court-martial. Pvt. Manning is charged with 21 offenses, but the most serious is aiding the enemy. That charge carries a possible sentence of up to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors gave their closing arguments Thursday. They said Pvt. Manning was a traitor whose only mission was to find and reveal government secrets to WikiLeaks, then bask in the attention as a whistleblower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge, not a jury is hearing the case at Pvt. Manning's request. It's not clear when she will rule.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK- A not guilty plea was entered today on behalf of a Connecticut-based hedge fund charged in a criminal indictment with letting insider trading flourish over a 10-year period as it grew into an investing giant and made hundreds of millions of dollars illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plea in Manhattan federal court was made by Peter Nussbaum, longtime general counsel for SAC Capital Advisors, a day after the company was charged with wire and securities fraud. Federal prosecutors described a culture at SAC that permitted, if not encouraged, insider trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant U.S. Attorney Antonia Apps told U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain that the evidence was &quot;voluminous&quot; and included emails and the results of wiretaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stamford, Conn.-based SAC said in a statement after the charges were announced Thursday that it will continue normal operations. It said it &quot;has never encouraged, promoted or tolerated insider trading and takes its compliance and management obligations seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. - The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News in an interview that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favored convicting Mr. Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the six-member, all-women jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&quot; she said. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God,&quot; she said. &quot;And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAKLAND -- A doctoral student in anthropology pleaded not guilty Friday to charges he smashed the window of a downtown Men's Wearhouse store during a protest last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzeen Doha, 34, who studies social anthropology and critical theory at UC Davis, is one of only two people charged in the late-night vandalism that erupted in downtown Oakland on July 13, 14 and 15 after protests against the Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed an unarmed black teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oakland police and city leaders have pledged to crack down on the post-verdict vandalism that damaged stores, restaurants and community centers, but finding those responsible has proved difficult. Many wore masks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chaotic events have also added to an ongoing debate over whether Oakland's frequent protests are fueled by youthful rage against racial injustice or more academic and anti-capitalist causes that attract activists from throughout the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doha, listed in police records as a San Jose resident, and his lawyer, Gabriela Lopez, declined to comment on the misdemeanor vandalism charge after a hearing at the Wiley Manuel Courthouse in Oakland. Police officers said in a written complaint they saw the storefront window spider and crash down after Doha swung an object at it with his right arm at about 10:45 p.m. on July 15, the third night of protests..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former philosophy lecturer and teaching associate at San Jose State University has described himself as a member of the Occupy movement on the UC Davis campus, where he has been a student since 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Capitalism cannot sustain itself,&quot; Doha said in an interview with an online publication last year, &quot;but we cannot be spectators either. We must act to accelerate this process, so we can open up a different future. ... The task is to identify certain points in the crisis and intervene accordingly to dismantle capitalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also charged in the Men's Warehouse vandalism is Oakland resident Lamar Caldwell, 27, who is scheduled for a hearing next week on a more serious felony vandalism charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caldwell, who also goes by the name Hannibal Shakur, protested his prosecution in a missive published online and asked for help paying his legal costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A window is made of sand and can be replicated exactly,&quot; Caldwell wrote. &quot;A rectangle window, of the dimensions I am being charged with breaking, doesn't need to be replicated because the manufacturer keeps spare windows around for replacement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, &quot;a human life is priceless because it can never be replaced,&quot; he said in reference to the Florida slaying of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Senate was out of session Monday, but John McCain was on Capitol Hill, joking, as he often does, about &quot;trying to do the Lord's work here in the city of Satan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this particular day, the Lord's work involved a bit of bowel humor. &quot;There was a poll recently on the favorability of everything in American life,&quot; he told a gathering in the Russell Senate Office Building, upstairs from his office. &quot;The favorability numbers of Congress ranked just below a colonoscopy. So we are trying to raise it at least above that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arizona Republican is certainly doing his part to raise his colleagues' image above that of the intestinal probe. On Sunday, he appeared on CNN, praising President Obama's speech on the George Zimmerman case and proposing a review of the &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws that came to attention because of the killing of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days earlier, McCain had brokered a deal averting a procedural meltdown in the Senate over the filibuster. Before that, he was a key figure in drafting the bipartisan immigration bill that cleared the Senate. Also this year, he has called some of his hard-line Republican colleagues &quot;wacko birds&quot; and has criticized them for blocking a budget resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this is to say the Mac is Back. Again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a long wait. The maverick of 2000 and the thorn in George W. Bush's side during the years that followed became a very different figure as he captured the 2008 Republican nomination, gave us Sarah Palin, fought against health care reform and staved off a tea party challenger in 2010. He walked away from earlier positions on tax cuts, campaign finance reform, immigration, climate change, gays in the military and other issues. When he continued that course even after the 2010 election, I figured he had been lost to the right wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 20 minutes Monday, I strolled with McCain in the Russell building and sat in his office, getting his perspective on his retirement as maverick and subsequent reactivation. He acknowledged that he changed his emphasis on immigration in part &quot;to be in tune with the people of Arizona,&quot; and he said he thought it his duty as the party's former nominee to wage &quot;a bitter fight&quot; against Obamacare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he argued that the bigger change was in the circumstances. During the early Bush years, when Republicans were firmly in control of government, he resisted his own party and voted against Bush's early tax cuts. After Democrats took the reins, he turned his antagonism against them. Now power is divided, and McCain sees much of the problem coming from fellow Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a view,&quot; he said, &quot;that a reason for coming here is not to get something done but to prevent anything from getting done.&quot; He cited the standoff on a budget resolution: Republicans beat up on Senate Democrats for years for failing to pass a budget, and now that the Senate has finally passed one, Republicans are objecting to the Senate naming conferees to negotiate a budget with the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's also got a problem with the roughly 15 isolationists in the Senate GOP caucus, a few of whom earned his famous &quot;wacko birds&quot; label. McCain claims he borrowed the phrase from the Wall Street Journal -- &quot;not that I disagreed with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many on the left won't forgive McCain his trespasses in 2008 and 2010, and many on the right won't forgive what he did before and since. But McCain has arguably turned himself into the most important legislator in a generation, at the center of the debate on war, terrorism, spending, corruption, health care and just about everything else. Last week, McCain met for two hours with Obama and Vice President Biden on security matters; Monday morning, he had a tete-a-tete with Secretary of State John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I caught up with him Monday afternoon, he was pitching legislation to replace the dollar bill with a coin; next is legislation allowing people to order cable channels a la carte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCain laughed frequently during our meeting, and seemed to relish his return to the indispensable-man role. &quot;What else?&quot; he kept asking me, after I had exhausted my list of questions. He claimed not to be discouraged by the colonoscopy-level image of Congress. &quot;My strength and weakness is I enjoy being in the arena,&quot; he said, quoting his hero, Teddy Roosevelt. &quot;I like the fight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's good news. The important thing is not where McCain has been but that he's back. He's needed more than ever.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree entirely with Scott Anderson's commentary &quot;Transfer solution is a prescription for failure&quot; (July 24). Not only will the state law and court decision on school transfers do nothing to improve the receiving schools but, as Don Senti, head of the Cooperating School Districts, has said, it is certain that the sending schools will suffer very negative consequences from the hemorrhaging of students and money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Mr. Anderson fails to note, however, is that the destruction of such districts as Normandy and Riverview Gardens is precisely what most supporters of the transfer policy have in mind. Other than free-riding, self-interested parents who want to see their children gain access to high schools without paying for them, the only folks supporting the state law are two groups of ideologues: far-left bleeding-heart liberals who want to see a single, unitary metropolitan-wide school system in the name of &quot;inclusion&quot; and &quot;social justice,&quot; and far-right conservatives who want to torpedo the entire public school system in the name of &quot;school choice.&quot; Politics indeed makes strange bedfellows. Shame on the extremists on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. Martin Rochester o Clayton </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cartoon about Republicans went too far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming from the educational world, I believe in academic freedom, that professors should be able to teach and write what they believe without being penalized if the trustees or administrators do not agree with them. So, although disagreeing, I have been tolerant of the Post-Dispatch's consistent bombardment of the Republicans. But the cartoon on July 22 depicting Republicans as wanting whites only in the voting booth is going too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is so easy for holier-than-thou writers and cartoonists to sit at their desks and proclaim their moral platitudes, but how many of you have been in the trenches where the action is? Well, I have, and furthermore, I am a Republican and make no apologies for it. In 1953, as student body president of the University of Missouri, I appeared before a Missouri legislative committee crusading for black students to be admitted to the university. Later, as an ordained minister, I served in the Dale-Selby area of St. Paul, Minn., and then in downtown Los Angeles, where, among other things, I was responsible for integrating the largest church in the world at that time of our denomination - and suffered the consequences for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know many Republicans who would be as offended as I am by this cartoon. If you really want to know the truth about what Republicans believe, I would be glad to spend a day introducing many of them to you so you could learn firsthand for yourselves what they really believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any takers?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allowing horse slaughter plants could lead to more thefts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Deborah Peterson laments that &quot;horse slaughter gets all the attention&quot; (&quot;Crackdown on cattle-rustling pays off,&quot; July 19), I assume she is not talking about the Post-Dispatch, which has not penned one negative opinion on the subject and doesn't seem to understand the difference between the nature of horses and cattle. It is my understanding that horses are not suited for slaughter due to their skittish nature and excitability making it difficult, if not impossible, to slaughter horses humanely in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Peterson goes on to assert that cattle-rustling is a bigger problem than slaughtering horses in Missouri. What does she think is going to happen once Missouri opens up a horse slaughter plant? Horse theft will become as big a problem as cattle-rustling, if not more so, based on experiences in years past when many horses were stolen out of pastures and barns for slaughter in return for a quick profit. The only known statistical reporting on this subject was in California, which reported a 34 percent decrease in horse thefts after horse slaughter was banned in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should not encourage or ignore the inhumane practice of horse slaughter just because cattle-rustling is a bigger problem. These are two separate issues and should be dealt with as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diann Valenti o Lemay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep political commentary out of Home &amp; Away section</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing to express my strong opposition to allowing one of your columnists, Aisha Sultan, to use her position to voice her personal political beliefs in the Home &amp; Away section (&quot;What we can tell our children about the Zimmerman verdict and Trayvon Martin,&quot; July 21).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This section is supposed to be for something other than personal political views. The jury has spoken and as such is irreversible (except through appeal). Though verdicts many times are objectionable, this is one of the basic tenets of a free society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an honorably discharged Army veteran of more than 13 years, I swore an oath to defend the Constitution and as such for any fool to express themselves. However, I vehemently oppose reading political commentary from a very vocal minority in the garden section. If you value subscribers, please consider placing her in an appropriate department. No where in her diatribe did we read anything having to do with Home &amp; Away or gardening.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treatment of Trova sculptures shows lack of respect for artist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post-Dispatch has performed an important service for St. Louis and for the national arts community by exposing the sad situation at Laumeier Sculpture Park (&quot;Untreasured Trovas,&quot; July 21). The front-page article revealed that several sculptures given by St. Louis artist Ernest Trova to Laumeier and the St. Louis County park system had been broken and cast aside to deteriorate and others put up for sale, which the park system had no right to do. Fortunately, the sale was stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treatment of the Trova sculptures shows a complete lack of respect for art in general and for an artist whose work was once the toast of U.S. galleries and collectors. I never came across a more unprofessional museum situation during the 50 years I worked as a reporter and visual arts critic for the Detroit News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a present resident of the St. Louis, I am grateful to the Post-Dispatch for airing a rotten situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">End the screaming about race issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill McClellan's column &quot;Sick of white people, sick of black people&quot; (July 22) made too much sense. And it will continue to make sense as long as we have white people screaming at McClellan on the phone and the Rev. Al Sharpton inflaming African-Americans in the streets. There will be no end to this lack of comity until, as the poet Gwendolyn Brooks once said, we are &quot;all tea-colored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Joel Currier's Monday front-page article on Jevon Mallory, the Meramec bathroom assailant, was even more revealing in that it explained that Mallory, as a Ritenour middle-schooler, had held a knife to the throat of a teacher at the school. Apparently nothing came of that incident, so Mallory four years later was free to pull an encore of sorts at Meramec.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reverse-Trayvon aspects of the Mallory story only enhance the reverse-Trayvon syndrome in the &quot;knockout game&quot; played out several times in recent years on South Grand Boulevard. Was racism involved in any of these incidents to a greater or lesser degree than the Zimmerman case? Apparently not because they have triggered no rallies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A juror in the trial of neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman has said she feels he got away with murder for fatally shooting teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, but that there was not enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges over the 2012 death of the unarmed 17-year-old. The Miami teenager was shot dead during a confrontation with Mr Zimmerman. The case spawned heated national debates about racial profiling and the so-called 'stand your ground' self-defence laws in Florida and other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 told ABC News that she favoured convicting Mr Zimmerman of second-degree murder when the six-member, all-woman jury began its deliberations. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury. I fought to the end,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the second day of deliberating, she realised there was not enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighbourhood watch volunteer of a crime. She said: &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman was seen publicly for the first time last week when he assisted a family after their vehicle overturned on a Florida highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 is the second panellist to go public with what went on during deliberations earlier this month. She allowed her face to be shown and used her first name, Maddy, unlike Juror B37, who was interviewed on CNN last week with her face obscured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four jurors, not including the one interviewed by ABC, issued a statement last week saying the opinions expressed by Juror B37 to CNN's Anderson Cooper did not represent their views. That juror said the actions of Mr Zimmerman and Trayvon both led to the teenager's fatal shooting, but that Mr Zimmerman did not actually break the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 also told ABC that she did not believe race was an issue at the trial. Though the judge so far has refused to release the names or biographical information about the jurors, B29 said she is 36 years old and Puerto Rican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon was black and Mr Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Trayvon's parents believe Mr Zimmerman racially profiled their son when he started following him after spotting him walking through the area where Mr Zimmerman lived and the teenager was visiting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 said she feels as though she owes Trayvon's parents an apology. She said: &quot;I felt like I let a lot of people down and I'm thinking to myself 'Did I go the right way? Did I go the wrong way?' As much as we were trying to find this man guilty... They give you a booklet that basically tells you the truth, and the truth is that there was nothing that we could do about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">IL OPINION; Pg. 13</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">724 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight American presidents owned slaves while living in the White House. President Zachary Taylor pledged that his fellow slave-owners would &quot;appeal to the sword if necessary&quot; to keep them. So when an American president arrived at the White House briefing room to speak of his personal experience with racial bias, it stirred some historical ghosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, President Obama's 18-minute remarks did not aspire to memorable rhetoric. Rather than &quot;I have a dream,&quot; it was &quot;I have an explanation.&quot; But he explained something uncomfortable and important: How America contains within itself different experiences of the promise and justice of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking as president, Obama responsibly affirmed the integrity of the legal process in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. Speaking as an African-American, he identified with the experience of being singled out for scrutiny. He talked of being followed in department stores and of being preceded by clicking car locks. This description was more powerful for being clinical. He effectively conveyed a social reality many people seldom consider. One of the privileges of looking privileged is anonymity. One of the burdens of appearing less privileged is feeling watched &amp;#8212; followed by &quot;eyes that fix you,&quot; according to T.S. Eliot, &quot;in a formulated phrase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some conservatives attacked Obama for being &quot;divisive&quot; and for injecting race into the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin debate. Those criticisms were misdirected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is perfectly appropriate for a president to apply his own history to his role as communicator and policymaker. Or is it only concerning the issue of race that a president should ignore his own background for fear of being &quot;divisive&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposite criticism is more serious &amp;#8212; that Obama has missed opportunities over the years to talk about race in a compelling and personal way. It is the unavoidable American issue. At one point, a third of all human beings in the South were owned by another human being. For a century beyond slavery, Jim Crow laws enforced a racial caste system. The election of an African-American president &amp;#8212; born three years before passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 &amp;#8212; is a wonder of national healing and historical compression. Who can argue that we have heard too much from Obama on this topic? For five years, he strategically downplayed the reality of his own miracle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having finally engaged the issue of race, Obama drew the correct policy implication. Social divisions are deepest when it comes to African-American boys and young men: often betrayed by schools, abandoned by fathers, treated with suspicion, unable to find jobs, wandering through dysfunctional neighborhoods, locked in prison in vast numbers and denied basic civil rights (such as voting) for the rest of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Obama's speech deserves this criticism: Its policy proposals &amp;#8212; training police, reconsidering stand your ground laws, more community dialogue and &quot;soul-searching&quot; &amp;#8212; were weak. It was as though the administration's policy apparatus had never really considered the matter before &amp;#8212; that it was somehow ambushed by America's most obvious policy challenge. The problem of African-American boys and young men is a complex mix of lingering racial prejudice, urban economic dislocation, collapsing family structure, failing schools and sick, atomized communities. But is there really nothing practical that can be done? How about providing family supports &amp;#8212; mentoring, fatherhood initiatives, teen pregnancy prevention, and removing the Earned Income Tax Credit penalty for married couples? How about strong accountability measures to close the educational achievement gap instead of granting waivers that lower standards? How about support for faith-based institutions that reclaim lives from gangs? How about prison reform, so that mandatory minimum sentences are at least reduced? How about expanding substance abuse prevention and treatment, which seem to have fallen off the national agenda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acknowledging a vast national division in a responsible way, as Obama has done, is not itself divisive. But healing that division will require the president to employ a presidential power he seldom uses: to drive and shape a policy debate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B-29, the only minority juror from the controversial trial, is identified only as &quot;Maddy&quot; during her interview, which is detailed at abcnews.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names of the jurors have not yet been made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told court officials during jury selection that she is a certified nursing assistant in an Alzheimer's ward. She is 36 years old, Puerto Rican, married and has several children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She lived in Chicago at the time Zimmerman shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roberts conducted the interview with &quot;Maddy&quot; on Thursday morning after &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recap of the interview on abcnews.com, Maddy told Roberts: &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maddy&quot; said when she and her fellow jurors began deliberations, she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the second day of deliberations, Maddy said, she realized there wasn't enough evidence to convict Zimmerman of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's where I felt confused, where if a person kills someone, then you get charged for it,&quot; Maddy told Roberts. &quot;But as the law was read to me, if you have no proof that he killed him intentionally, you can't say he's guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy said she feels that she owes an apology to Trayvon's parents because she feels &quot;like I let them down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Maddy explained how the jury arrived at its acquittal: &quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; she said. &quot;But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first portions of the interview will air on &quot;World News With Diane Sawyer&quot; on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More of the exclusive interview will be seen Thursday night on &quot;Nightline.&quot; The full interview will air Friday on &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy is represented by attorney David Chico of Celebration, Fla. Attempts to reach him Thursday were not immediately successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first juror to talk to the press was B-37, who was photographed in shadows when she spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unknown when the juror names will be revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were granted anonymity because of the high-profile nature of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys have asked Circuit Judge Debra Nelson to extend that anonymity for six months. She has made no ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media attorneys have opposed the idea, saying that to assure that trials remain an open and public process juror names should not be kept secret.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congrats to the editorial board. Finally! We have met the enemy, and it is us. Drugs are a poison that even the Mafia would not allow their members to use. However, it's good to know some of our nation's leaders are now addressing the poor American users' rights (not to be confused with responsibilities) by legalizing the poison.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">God's word</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a couple of most unusual letters to the editors we found in The Tampa Tribune July 19 (Fairy tale and Bible doesn't govern, Your Views). They were unusual in the sense that they demeaned, denigrated and ridiculed God and slandered him with the names of space genie, sad nosey loser and Prince Charming, and referred to the authors of the Bible as barely literate sheepherders and Bronze Age flat-earthers - all the while referring to Christians as outrageously ignorant and gullible people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of those outrageously ignorant people, I was somewhat taken aback at  the anger and hatred contained in the letters since the writers had obviously rejected God and his word and were pursuing an uninhibited life. So what's the problem? I believe it is apparent that many people living a lifestyle that is rejected and condemned by the Bible, and homosexuality certainly is, resort to vilifying both God and his followers, with, I assume, the hope of making their choice of a lifestyle more acceptable, either to them or others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is a losing argument since the Bible has been our moral standard since the inception of our nation, and the Bible condemns homosexual acts as an abomination, unnatural and an act of depravity. And the Bible is not subject to additions or deletions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can pass new laws accepting and promoting homosexuality and receive many court decisions doing the same, but it will never be accepted. The word of God will always stand and ultimately prevail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not often that the mainstream media show up the fallacies so firmly rooted in society's culture. Both of these letters showed clearly and conclusively the emptiness of religion built up over the centuries and its equally terrible grip on our thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You dared the disapproval of many in your readership because you gave space to the truth. Again, thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lessons from Rays</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After watching the Rays win another game on TV last Sunday, I watched the  30-minute Inside the Rays segment, covering two of the Rays' top relievers, that followed. Fernando Rodney and Joel Peralta are both from the Dominican Republic and are best friends on the team as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interviews, they both said that growing up in the same country is what first brought them together. They had so much in common, according to one of them. Just then, it occurred to me that Peralta looks very similar to George Zimmerman (light-skinned Hispanic with a similar body type). Fernando Rodney, however, has very dark skin - like Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peralta and Rodney get along great. In addition, the fact that they both grew up in the same country created an immediate bond between them. This also got me to thinking: Why does the color of one's skin mean so much more in the United States than it does in the Dominican Republic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps if we can find answers to this question, we will be more successful improving race relations in our own country, cities, towns and neighborhoods. If someone would like to start a task force to look into this, count me in.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rays need new ideas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter in last Saturday's View's section (Alternatives for Rays) is close to being right on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are Rays fans and season-ticket holders and travel 45 miles each way to the games. We pay about $50 for each seat per game, and parking is at least $15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food costs a small fortune - $5 hot dogs and pretzels, and $8 beers. It's not cheap to go to a game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That being said, think about this: Tropicana field is old but adequate. There are no rain-outs, it's 72-degrees inside and it's somewhat easy to get to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rays organization should think about this. Lower the parking fees and some of the food prices. Lower the price of tickets all around, and for season-tickets holders. Make it easier for the fans to fill their seats, and the numbers will add up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, building a new stadium closer to me would be fine, but is that the answer? Look at what happened to the Marlins - a new stadium did nothing for their attendance, and there are a lot more people in Miami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to ruin the Rays' fan base, don't even think about moving them out of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rays' management has to wake up and smell the flowers. We love our Rays, but you guys have to come up with some new ideas and make it cheaper for us to fill your seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go Rays!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. - Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distill it to its marrow, and that is what African-Americans have been telling other Americans since February 2012, when the unarmed teenager was stalked and killed by George Zimmerman, who, for no good reason, thought him suspicious. And it is essentially what President Obama said in an impromptu appearance in the White House press room last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We African-Americans see ourselves, our sons and grandsons, in this dead boy. And we hear no whisper of there but for the grace of God, but, rather, a nightmare scream of what could yet be, in a nation that would afterward slander them till it seemed they deserved what they got and more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pointedly including himself among our number, in testifying that even the most powerful man in the world once saw women clutch their purses when he got on an elevator, Obama committed an act of moral courage. It was all the more remarkable because it carried no political upside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that everyone understood. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me, said the president, after which Sean Hannity, a grand wizard of the extreme right, professed confusion, wondering if by this, Obama meant he smoked pot and he did a little blow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so it goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That coarse attempt at wit pretty much emblematizes the behavior of many so-called conservatives since Zimmerman's acquittal. They have redoubled their efforts to fashion a fairly ordinary teenager into some general purpose thug who somehow needed shooting, and his killer into some righteous street avenger who stalked him from justifiable fear because, we all know young black men are criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young black men. Not Trayvon Benjamin Martin, 17, son of Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton. Because the first casualty of racism is individuality, the right to be your singular self.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what was stolen from Trayvon even before his life. It is stolen anew every time some pundit bloviates upon the perceived criminality of young black men to justify his killing. That perception is rooted more in stereotype and fear than actual fact, but put that aside and ask yourself this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What man or woman among us would be willing to let the rest of us judge them based not upon who they are and what they have done, but solely upon our perceptions of people like them? There is, for instance, a perception that methamphetamine use is concentrated among white people in red states - in other words, Sean Hannity's audience. May we treat all white people in red states accordingly? Will they go for that deal? Of course not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet we daily crucify young black men upon that cross and pretend to moral righteousness in the doing. Trayvon is not the first victim. He's not even the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is the one whose death has made us cry, Enough!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There comes a time when people get tired. So said Martin Luther King in his first speech as leader of the Montgomery bus boycott. From that fatigue grew a movement that reshaped America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hopes people are that tired again - and that it spurs a new movement to challenge not just laws, but attitudes so corroded and stained some of us cannot even muster compassion for the death of a blameless boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is wrong. It is unworthy of decent people. And so, it cannot stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thing the rest of the country may not fully appreciate is how deeply that loss of individuality cuts for African-Americans, how closely it binds us. So yes, of course Barack Obama is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. And let there be no mistake:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am Trayvon, too.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writer-director Ryan Coogler's impactful Fruitvale Station - a dramatic re-enactment of the final day in the life of a young black man killed by a white transit cop in Oakland, Calif. - opens at a time when issues about justice and race in America are front of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Trayvon Martin, 22-year-old Oscar Grant III was unarmed when he was shot on New Year's Day 2009, his death forming the narrative framework for Coogler's film, which was greeted with major prizes at Sundance and Cannes ahead of its July 26 opening in Toronto. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First-time filmmaker Coogler gives Fruitvale Station a sense of documentary-like immediacy and a frightening jolt of reality with the first scene, which is filmed not by him, but the witnesses to Grant's death early on New Year's Day 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hard to know what we are watching at first with the tilting, jumpy cellphone footage taken by passengers in the Oakland station that gives the film its title. A handful of black men are seated on the floor, their backs to a low wall. Minutes before, police had ordered them off a subway train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd hoots. The men sitting at the officers' feet are frustrated and edgy. People on the train call out to the cops to leave them alone. Suddenly, Grant is face-down on the station floor. There's a sharp pop, the sound of the bullet to his back and an anguished cry from a witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler, who also wrote the script, immediately pulls the audience away from the station and into Oscar's life for a dramatic recreation that mostly follows his final 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael B. Jordan (The Wire and Friday Night Lights) plays Oscar with the heart and compelling charm required to make us feel close to him. It's a natural performance that feels effortless as he presents a man unknowingly living his final day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many of us, Oscar wakes on New Year's Eve with a sense of purpose, anxious to make some changes to his life. A doting father to 4-year-old T (Ariana Neal) he is determined to repair the rifts he's caused in his relationship with girlfriend Sophina (a wonderful Melonie Diaz of Lords of Dogtown).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's trying his best to be a better man, but he's done some prison time and his quick temper and lack of reliability has already cost him his job - something he hasn't shared with Sophina. He's devoted to his mother, Wanda (The Help's Octavia Spencer) even if he can't help disappointing her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that he lacks support; Oscar is awash in family love and care. He spends the last day of his life running errands for his mother's birthday dinner, teasing his sister and helping a stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's messed up before, but this time will be right, even as conflicts arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the thing about Oscar, he's always regretful and ashamed after he lets people down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, it's an ordinary life and while the inevitable end of it is always close by Jordan's approach adds an undercurrent of inescapable sadness rather than foreboding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this presentation of Oscar often skews too much toward the ideal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An encounter with a stray dog that acts as a warning and a snap decision about a drug deal begins to strain believability. Can someone who has had so much trouble in his life really be so selfless?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urged by his mother to take a safer way to the city than driving to mark the New Year, Oscar and his friends take the train. The post-midnight trip home leads to the altercation set off by a meeting that's a little too much of a coincidence, ending with Oscar on the platform. Canadian actor Kevin Durand plays the edgy transit cop who fires the bullet. Coogler, himself from Oakland and roughly Oscar's age when the shocking story of his death was in the local news, brings personal intimacy to Fruitvale Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But are we reacting to the horrors of the shooting of an unarmed young man or to the quality of the film made about him?</SPAN></P>

Four people fled into a nearby river when a police officer stopped the car, which an official said &quot;probably didn't have a road permit.&quot; Courtesy/AP - Orlando, Fla.: Zimmerman got away with murder, juror says The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News in an interview made available Thursday that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him. Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the six-member jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer of a crime. &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God,&quot; she said. &quot; Baghdad: Cafe bombings, attacks kill at least 42 in Iraq Emboldened militants in Iraq set up their own checkpoint to kill drivers and bombed crowded cafes Thursday in the deadliest of a series of attacks that killed at least 42 people, authorities said. More than 550 people have been killed in violent attacks so far this month, according to an Associated Press count, as violence continues during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Tunis, Tunisia: Death of opposition leader sparks protests Angry anti-government demonstrations broke out Thursday across Tunisia after gunmen killed the leader of a leftist opposition party, raising fears of new chaos on the difficult road to democracy in the cradle of the Arab Spring. Just five months after a similar assassination plunged the country into crisis, two gunmen shot Mohammed Brahmi, leader of the Popular Current party, in his car near his home. Protesters immediately blamed the latest killing on the government. Soon after news broke, crowds gathered outside the Interior Ministry in the heart of Tunis calling for its downfall. Cairo: Egypt braces for day of rival rallies on Friday Political allies of Egypt's military lined up behind its call for huge rallies Friday to show support for the country's top general, pushing toward a collision with Islamist opponents demanding the return of the nation's ousted president. Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who ousted President Mohammed Morsi on July 3, took many by surprise when he announced he wanted people to take to the streets in large numbers on Friday to give him a popular mandate to take the necessary measures against &quot;violence and terrorism.&quot; Pro-Morsi Islamists also plan rallies on Friday, raising the possibility of street clashes. Lac-Megantic, Quebec: Canada police raid offices of railway company Police raided the Canadian office of a U.S. railway company to collect evidence in a criminal investigation related to an oil train derailment this month that devastated a Quebec town and killed 47 people. Quebec provincial police inspector Michel Forget said Thursday that officers are searching the offices of Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway to collect undisclosed evidence. Boston: Businessman says Bulger put shotgun in his mouth A real estate developer on Thursday described a harrowing encounter with James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger, recounting how the reputed gangster shoved a shotgun in his mouth and threatened to kill him if he did not pay $200,000. Richard Buccheri described the 1986 meeting while testifying in the racketeering trial of Bulger Among the homicides in which Bulger has been implicated is the 1981 slaying of Tulsa businessman Roger Wheeler, 55, chairman of Telex Corp. Kelly told Judge Denise Casper that prosecutors plan to wrap up their case against Bulger following testimony from two more witnesses. SUBHEAD: Cool car news briefs </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching one of the many cellphone videos of the incident, we know something terrible, and terribly wrong, has happened. When a BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) officer shot Oscar Grant in the back on Jan. 1, 2009 - while Grant was on his belly with his hands cuffed behind his back, and with the white officer kneeling on top of him - the outrage in Oakland, Calif., and beyond was understandable. It was demanded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the officer was not convicted of first-degree murder, but of involuntary manslaughter (he argued that he believed he had pulled out his Taser), and when he was released from prison just 11 months later, that wound was opened again. Black people - and people of other races - must examine this type of justice and ask: What if the roles had been reversed? Would that have been the sentence if Oscar Grant were a white man? &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; is a dramatization of a real event that not only examines that fateful day but also determinedly shows the man whose life story ended that day. It is also one of the best pictures you will see this year, having already won both the grand jury prize and the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. With his first feature film, writer-director Ryan Coogler - a 27-year-old native of the East Bay area and virtually the same age as Oscar were he still alive - has created a work that is both personal and universal. The depth of characterization, as well as the evenhanded treatment of the events, make this an important film. Through the performance of Michael B. Jordan (whose quality work moves from TV's &quot;The Wire&quot; and &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; to movies), we are given the full, unvarnished spectrum of Oscar's life in the 24 hours that is the last day of his life. We see Oscar at Farmer Joe's market in Oakland, where his girlfriend and his mother believe he is still working. On this day, he is buying crab for gumbo for the night's celebration of his mother's birthday, and we see him pleading with the manager for his job back, lost to his being chronically late for work. He stresses to his former boss how important regaining the job is, to the point of losing his temper and blurting out a disturbing combination of both cry-for-help and threat: &quot;Do you want me selling dope?&quot; Oscar asks in the middle of a store aisle. &quot;Do you want me waiting for you after work?&quot; Where there is a tendency to transform characters in these tales into saints, Coogler uses this scene and others (his mother visiting him in San Quentin one year before his death) to show that he is not perfect. He is not an angel. In both scenes, this is hammered home by Jordan, whose level of intimidating ferocity is palpable. One minute, he's gently telling his mom of his love for his 4-year-old daughter Tatiana; the next minute in the visiting area, when an inmate enemy confronts him rudely, his mother is forgotten as a furious Oscar reacts as a coiled snake, ready to strike against one who would disrespect him. This latter moment is a flashback scene, and we can't help but notice the humanizing scenes of the movie that balance against it: Oscar has a mother's love (Octavia Spencer of &quot;The Help&quot; provides tough love; she won't talk to Oscar when he's driving and talking at the same time); Oscar has a close bond with his whip-smart daughter and his grandmother; he clearly loves his girlfriend and wants to be a better man. He is not alone in the world, but rather he has many connections in his support system. He is deeply flawed, but we see potential in him. He is 22, and there is time for him to become a better man - or there should be. Coogler's film is slight at 85 minutes, yet it's also tight and highly watchable. Although the filmmaker's hand-held camera can intrude on the enjoyment and his foreshadowing can be a bit much (the metaphor of Oscar giving aid to a dog in the road is over-the-top), he makes up for it with so many carefully constructed scenes of quiet power. Balance against these, obviously, comes in the conclusion, when a shot rings out in a loud train station, and confusion reigns. For many, in the wake of Oscar Grant and Trayvon Martin and others gone too soon, they can only wonder when such shots will no longer echo through society. h5 class=&quot;title&quot;'FRUITVALE STATION'/h5 Cast: Michael B.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lone minority member of the jury that acquitted George Zimmerman says Zimmerman &quot;got away with murder&quot; in the killing of teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with ABC News that aired Thursday evening, the woman identified as Juror B-29 said she feels she owes an apology to Trayvon's parents over the verdict that touched off protest demonstrations around the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juror said the six-member, all-female jury followed Florida law and found the evidence did not warrant a murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty,&quot; said the juror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She declined to be identified by her full name and was referred to in the interview as &quot;Maddy.&quot; She allowed her face to be shown in the interviews airing on World News With Diane Sawyer and today on Good Morning America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, who did not testify in his own defense, contended he shot and killed Trayvon in  self-defense during a confrontation in a neighborhood of Sanford, Fla., on Feb. 26, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identities of the jurors were sealed by the Florida court and have not yet been made public. ABC News said she did not allow her full name to be used out of concern for her safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was described as a 36-year-old nursing assistant and mother of eight children. A Puerto Rican, she had moved to Seminole County, Fla., from Chicago only five months before her selection to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is the second of the six jurors to speak publicly since the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, is Hispanic and Trayvon, 17, was black. The case was racially charged from the outset, and prosecutors alleged Zimmerman &quot;profiled&quot; the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy said the case was not about race as far as she was concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God. And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with,&quot; Maddy said. But, she added, &quot;the law couldn't prove it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maddy said she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when the jury began its deliberations. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them the hung jury. I fought to the end,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After nine hours of discussion, Maddy said, she concluded there wasn't enough proof to convict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon's mother, Sybrina Fulton, issued a statement Thursday night saying that she found the juror's remarks painful but true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from juror B-29, comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true: That George Zimmerman literally got away with murder,&quot; Fulton said. <BR></SPAN></P>

This surely is lamentable, but why does this happen? It is, of course, because young black men commit a disproportionate number of crimes. That is the problem, and if we insist on ignoring it, nothing is going to change.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwelling on the symptoms is counterproductive. We must face the facts and work together to provide pathways for young black men to enter the mainstream of society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Gerson's critique of President Obama's remarks on Trayvon Martin [&quot;An incomplete speech,&quot; op-ed, July 23] was an exercise in missing the point. Suppose the president had indeed concluded with a Gerson-style action plan: &quot;fatherhood&quot; and &quot;faith-based&quot; initiatives, tax credits (always big on the agenda of black youth) and educational &quot;accountability&quot; (aren't Republicans already attacking the Common Core State Standards ?). Such proposals would have triggered yet another dispiriting round of partisan debate and feigned outrage over real or imagined federal mandates and spending - instigated largely by the right wing of Mr. Gerson's own party. The president's message about the African American historical experience and racial reconciliation would have been smothered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If nothing else, the vocal talent showcased in &quot;20 Feet From Stardom,&quot; a documentary about backup singers, affords the viewer/listener with a 90-minute Auto-Tune-free zone. For fans of the musical instrument that is the unaltered human voice, it's a rare treat. But it's not just that. The film also is an engaging look at the nexus of art and commerce, talent and hard work. It's a story of standing out and blending in, sometimes at the same time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several musical superstars are interviewed throughout the film by Morgan Neville, a producer and director of music documentaries. Still, Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Stevie Wonder and others do more talking here than performing. Oddly, Bette Midler is practically the only woman of their stature to be interviewed by the director, which may say more about the music industry's sexism than Neville. That reading is suggested by another statistic. All of the background singers who are profiled in depth - and who are the movie's real stars - are women: Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Judith Hill, Claudia Lennear, Darlene Love and Tata Vega. The distance alluded to in the title, which is taken from a comment made by Springsteen near the beginning of the film, is both literal and metaphorical. The journey from anonymous edge of the stage to the spotlight, he says, &quot;can be a pretty long walk.&quot; As one commentator notes, whenever you sing along with the radio, you're probably singing along with the background vocalist. (PG-13, 90 minutes)  Contains some obscenity and sexual material. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Michael O'Sullivan<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrr THE ATTACK</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Attack&quot; opens like a love story, with a woman telling her husband that every time they separate, &quot;a part of me dies.&quot; In light of what happens next, those words take on another, more ominous meaning. Set in Tel Aviv and the West Bank town of Nablus, the taut but messily honest tale is the story of Amin (Ali Suliman), a prominent Israeli surgeon of secular Palestinian background who wakes up one morning to discover that his beautiful wife, Siham (Reymond Amsalem), has become a suicide bomber, responsible for blowing herself up in a restaurant, along with 17 other victims, including 11 children celebrating a birthday. It's 3 a.m. when Amin gets the call to identify his wife's body, or what's left of it. The grisly fact that there's not much left of Siham from the rib cage down is pretty much all the incriminating evidence that the police need. That doesn't stop Amin from believing that there must be some mistake. As it becomes increasingly obvious that the mistake was his - in overlooking whatever clues there may have been to Siham's secret life as a Palestinian terrorist - he sets out to find answers to a difficult question, as he frames it: &quot;How do you make a fundamentalist monster out of a woman who wouldn't hurt a fly?&quot; The search takes Amin briefly to Nazareth, where his wife was from, and then to Nablus, where she spent the last night of her life. What he ends up finding along the way are more questions. (R, 102 minutes) Contains some grisly images, obscenity, brief nudity and sensuality. In Hebrew and Arabic with subtitles. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- M.O.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrr BEFORE MIDNIGHT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Linklater made his name in 1991 with &quot;Slacker,&quot; a low-key, discursive ramble through Austin that introduced a new generation and a spontaneous form of filmmaking that concealed surprising intelligence and artfulness beneath its laid-back style. Linklater has gone on to pursue a wonderfully eclectic career, hopping from sci-fi animation (&quot;Waking Life&quot;) to family-friendly comedies (&quot;School of Rock&quot;) with easygoing finesse. But now and then he returns to the talky, elliptical movie he started out making: In 1995, he made &quot;Before Sunrise,&quot; starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as Jesse and Celine, two people in their 20s who meet on a train and spend a romantic night having one long conversation while strolling through Vienna; in 2004 he caught up with the couple in &quot;Before Sunset,&quot; when they meet again a decade later. With luck, Linklater isn't bringing the couple's story to an end with &quot;Before Midnight&quot; - I, for one, can't wait to see Jesse and Celine confront their later years in &quot;Before I Have to Get Up and Pee Again.&quot; But there's no doubt that &quot;Before Midnight,&quot; which finds the young lovers of yore firmly ensconced within the regret and compromise of middle age, also finds them grappling with intimations of aging and mortality. Jesse and Celine still tease, seduce, wind each other up and prattle on with the same verve, but there's an autumnal whiff to even their sunniest repartee. (R, 108 minutes) Contains sexual content, nudity and profanity. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Ann Hornaday<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rr BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A biopic gets the Bollywood treatment in &quot;Bhaag Milkha Bhaag&quot; (&quot;Run Milkha Run&quot;), which dramatizes the life of record-breaking Indian sprinter Milkha Singh, played by the talented Farhan Akhtar. The movie begins in 1960 with Milkha's failed attempt at securing a medal during the Rome Olympics. Despondent, he tries to withdraw from a government-orchestrated race in Pakistan. One of the organizers can't comprehend why Milkha would quit, but the runner's coach explains (complete with sorrowful music) that the young man has personal reasons. Naturally, the government official asks for further explanation. And, boy, does he get an answer. There is a short version: As a child, Milkha's family was killed in front of him after the 1947 partition landed his Sikh village on the Pakistani side of the border. But the coach weaves an epic tale instead, and his hyper-detoured response, full of tales of first love and youthful troublemaking, lasts about twice as long as it should. Some of the stories offer a bit of comedy, a chance to stage a requisite Bollywood musical number or offer some insight into Milkha's personality. There is a sweet subplot involving the beloved sister that raised him and some lively comic relief from his early days in the military (amusingly, the setting for the film's most memorable song-and-dance number). The movie also spotlights the exuberant moment Milkha first discovered competitive running. Like most Bollywood films, Milkha's story is supposed to be a saga. But aside from a horrifying experience in childhood and some major triumphs on the track, much of the rest of his history feels like filler held together by a faulty framing device. (Unrated, 188 minutes) Contains sexual situations and violence. In Hindi with English subtitles. At Regal Countryside 20. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Stephanie Merry<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrr THE CONJURING</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Conjuring&quot; is one heck of a ghost story. Based on the highly scientific DLPG scale - measured by the number of times I looked over my shoulder as I hurried through a Dimly Lit Parking Garage after the movie - it's a well-above-average thriller. If it isn't quite up there with such classics of the genre as &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963 version, please) or &quot;The Others,&quot; it isn't far behind. Set in 1971, the story is said to have been inspired by the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a husband-and-wife team of paranormal investigators. The action takes place in a 150-year-old Rhode Island farmhouse, where, almost immediately upon moving in, Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) and their five daughters start to experience disturbing events. First the dog won't come inside. Then there's a foul odor, followed by unexplained cold spots, clocks that stop at 3:07 a.m. and miscellaneous visits by things that go bump in the night. Thankfully, there are no bleeding walls, though the movie does bear an obvious debt of gratitude to &quot;The Amityville Horror,&quot; the real-life setting of which was also, coincidentally, investigated by the Warrens. When things get out of control one night - about the time a female poltergeist tries to body slam one of the daughters from the top of a haunted antique wardrobe - the Perrons invite the Warrens over to have a look-see. As played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, the Warrens bring a sort of deadpan credibility to the admittedly far-fetched goings-on. (R, 112 minutes) Contains intense scenes of terror and violence. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-M.O.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrr DESPICABLE ME 2</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minions are back. The little yellow torpedoes warmed hearts when they shuffled into 2010's animated hit &quot;Despicable Me&quot; with the bounciness of a beach ball, the elasticity of a rubber band and a vernacular composed mostly of giggles. Once again, they manage to tickle moviegoers big and small in the way only cat videos usually do, and they very nearly run off with the sequel, &quot;Despicable Me 2.&quot; But the sweet story holds its own. The Russian-accented Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is a very different villain than when we last saw him. He has traded in a life of crime, including moon thievery and other high jinks, for a more sedate occupation. Gru, his accomplice Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and the minions spend their days making jam, and Gru passes his evenings taking care of his adopted trio of daughters, Margo, Edith and Agnes. His biggest stressors are planning Agnes's birthday party and coming to grips with Margo's interest in boys. But this homey existence is shaken when agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) of the Anti-Villain League drops in with a lipstick taser and a plan to recruit the reformed bad guy. It seems that an under-the-radar supervillain has used a giant magnet to make off with an entire laboratory that housed a gooey substance capable of transforming people, animals and minions into purple snaggletoothed monsters that eat everything in sight. The league has tracked the supervillain to a mall, and they need Gru to embed himself deep within the concrete jungle to discern which of the store owners is responsible. Gru agrees to take on the gig, although he's hardly thrilled to be joined by Lucy as his new partner. (PG, 98 minutes) Contains rude humor and mild action. 98 minutes. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- S.M.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rr &Acirc;&frac12; EPIC</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In calling itself &quot;Epic,&quot; the new CGI adventure based on children's author and illustrator William Joyce's &quot;The Leaf Men&quot; might be guilty of overselling itself, just a bit. Yes, the movie is certainly more swollen in scope and tone than Joyce's eco-themed picture book on which it's (very loosely) based. That 2001 story of the secret, teeming life of a garden had a charm similar to the author's earlier &quot;George Shrinks,&quot; in that both books derived much of their enchantment from imagining what the world looks like if you're only an inch tall. Yet this film, on which Joyce worked as producer, writer and production designer, retains enough of the magic of the original to make it enormously visually appealing, even if the story itself is almost unrecognizably bloated. As in the book, the Leafmen are a race of bug-size soldiers who maintain the order and balance of the natural world. Riding saddled hummingbirds, they keep the forces of decay and rot - embodied by creatures known as the Boggans - at bay. But when Mandrake (voice of Christoph Waltz), the evil leader of the Boggans, attacks the Leafmen's queen (Beyonc Knowles) and steals the magical flower bud containing the soul of her replacement, the Leafmen must fight to get it back before its power is perverted into poisoning all life. (PG, 110 minutes) Contains cartoon violence, peril and death. At University Mall Theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-M.O.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrrr FRANCES HA</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If &quot;Frances Ha&quot; is what nepotism looks like, let's hear it for family trees. Consider: The writer-director of this small, gemlike coming-of-age comedy is Noah Baumbach, son of former Village Voice film critic Georgia Brown and author Jonathan Baumbach. Three of its most arresting supporting players - Mickey Sumner, Grace Gummer and Charlotte D'Amboise - are the daughters of Sting, Meryl Streep and ballet superstar Jacques D'Amboise, respectively. Not to be outdone, the incandescent star of &quot;Frances Ha,&quot; Greta Gerwig, casts her own parents as her character's mom and dad, roles they play with a bracing lack of self-consciousness or patronizing irony in a movie set squarely in that fraught nether-region between arrested adolescence and adulthood. Who knows what other showbiz skeletons are hiding in the closets of the superior ensemble cast? And who cares? Writing with Gerwig, Baumbach has created a fey, sneakily charming generational touchstone on a par with &quot;Annie Hall&quot; and his own Gen Y comedy &quot;Kicking and Screaming.&quot; And he has created a spectacular showcase for Gerwig, a creaturely, almost feral sprite whose instincts and born-ready camera presence have long been staples of hand-made indie productions, but have yet to find their rightful purchase in mainstream Hollywood. (R, 86 minutes) Contains sexual references and profanity. At AMC Loews Shirlington 7 and Landmark Bethesda Row Cinema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A.H.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rrrr FRUITVALE STATION</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; the astonishing directorial debut of 27-year-old Ryan Coogler, arrives in Washington with considerable wind at its back: Not only did this somber, meticulously constructed urban drama win big awards at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals, but its story - about an unarmed young man who was shot and killed in Oakland in the early hours of New Year's Day 2009 - has uncannily intersected with the recent verdict regarding the death of Trayvon Martin. The cable crawl-ready provenance of &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; makes it a topical film, no doubt. But what makes it a must-see is its timelessness: Coogler, who began writing the script as a film student at USC, brings not just classical aesthetic sensibilities to the tale of Oscar Grant but an unerring ethical stance, as well. In this absorbing, finally devastating portrait of a 22-year-old man struggling with a troubled past and cut down before he can build a future, Coogler never lets emotion be overpowered by emotionalism: In naturalistic and unforced strokes, he allows Grant to exist as a complex, even contradictory human, inviting the audience simply to sit with his life, his loss and what they both meant.&quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; begins with images many viewers will be familiar with: shaky cellphone footage of Grant's encounter with Oakland transit police who had detained him and some friends after an altercation on a train. Coogler then cuts to several hours earlier, when Grant - portrayed in an impressively mercurial performance by &quot;The Wire's&quot; Michael B. Jordan - is making New Year's resolutions with his girlfriend, Sophina (Melonie Diaz), and vowing to do better. (R, 84 minutes) Contains some violence, profanity throughout and some drug use.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- A.H.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">rr GIRL MOST LIKELY</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kristen Wiig delivers another spaced-out star turn in &quot;Girl Most Likely,&quot; a picaresque romance of self-discovery that delivers a near-constant flow of small delights until veering too far into screwball preposterousness. Wiig plays Imogene, who's introduced in a prologue as a precocious young actress who, when she's uttering the line &quot;There's no place like home&quot; in &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; turns to the director to say, &quot;This just isn't working for me.&quot; Flash forward 20 years and the grown-up Imogene is an aspiring playwright whose early ambition has been thwarted by the comfort and distraction offered by her wealthy boyfriend. In its bravura opening sequence - filmed entirely from Imogene's point of view - we hear only Wiig's voice as her character leaves a series of voicemails for her errant beau as she makes her way into a snooty Manhattan fundraiser. By the time the camera finally reveals Wiig's face in a powder room mirror, her carefully made-up expression of self-deception and defeat speaks volumes. Eventually, events transpire to send Imogene back home to Ocean City, N.J., a place she has been running from all her adult life and where she's now forced to live with her mother, Zelda (Annette Bening), a compulsive gambler; her troubled but sweet brother, Ralph (Christopher Fitzgerald); and her mom's boyfriend, George (Matt Dillon), who insists he's in the CIA and has a coffee mug to prove it.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly every Adam Sandler movie seems to provoke handwringing over whether he's living up to his potential. He's capable of portraying nuanced characters, as he did in &quot;Funny People&quot; and &quot;Punch-Drunk Love,&quot; but he's clearly happy to settle for his go-to routine of acting like a child and spewing lazy jokes that include his comic holy trinity: bodily fluids, flatulence and ogling scantily-clad women. The shtick must be rote by now, and, indeed, &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot; appears to have been made while engaging as few brain cells as possible. The movie revisits the group of longtime friends that made &quot;Grown Ups&quot; a hit in 2010, bringing in $162 million at the domestic box office. That impressive, if depressing, sum shows the hunger for senseless summer comedies. But &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot; isn't merely mindless. At times it seems to actually drain IQ points from its viewers while wasting a talented cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alums, all of whom are capable of being much smarter and so much funnier.The film follows four men (Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock and David Spade) over a single day as the quartet plans a 1980s-themed summer kickoff party. But every man also gets his own story line, each of which seems plucked from a bad sitcom. Sandler's Lenny is dealing with the fact that Roxanne (Salma Hayek) wants another baby; Kurt (Rock) gets to lord over Deanne (Maya Rudolph) that he remembered their anniversary and she didn't; Eric (James) has to hide frequent trips to his mom's house from Sally (Maria Bello); and Spade's Marcus finds out he fathered a son, who happens to be a tattooed teenage thug. All these threads, plus many more involving the younger generation's love lives, math deficiencies, sports aspirations, broken bones, dirty diapers and bullying, vie for attention over the course of the relatively short run time.

In &quot;The Heat,&quot; they play mismatched law enforcement officers who bicker and bumble their way into solving a crime and finding a friend. The conceit of the film, which was written by Katie Dippold and directed by Paul Feig - who directed McCarthy to sudden stardom in &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; - is that for all their differences, both share an essential loneliness that has kept them isolated and miserable. That sad subtext gives much of the humor in &quot;The Heat&quot; a melancholy edge, especially when it comes to McCarthy, who once again is forced into a role that asks little more of her than swearing like a stevedore and subjecting herself to undignified slapstick centered around her generous figure. Bullock plays McCarthy's opposite number: uptight, put-together and prim, so you know going in that &quot;The Heat&quot; will feature at least one drunken girl-bonding montage, which in this case arrives almost as a random, perfunctory insert. Seen through one lens, &quot;The Heat&quot; is the product of a cheering trend in female-centered comedies, a feminist sister under the skin to &quot;Bridesmaids.&quot; Seen through another, it revolves around the retrograde novelty of watching women swagger, spout vulgarities, brandish guns and toss around references to their vaginas (not to mention the odd areola and cervix).

Despite its plentiful and playful sexuality, this dose of Spanish fly is anything but exciting. The director should have stuck with the original Spanish title: &quot;Los Amantes Pasajeros.&quot; At least that phrase, which can be translated either as &quot;The Passenger Lovers&quot; or &quot;The Temporary Lovers,&quot; is a more accurate plot synopsis. Set mostly in the first-class section of an airliner en route from Spain to Mexico, the film consists of an alternating series of random conversations and random sexual couplings among a rogue's gallery of would-be colorful characters. Unfortunately, none of them is the least bit interesting. Almodovar's failure to arouse even perfunctory engagement with the story is almost incomprehensible, considering that, on paper at least, the film sounds totally wild. Let's start with the married, bisexual airplane captain, Alex (Antonio de la Torre). He and his boyfriend, head steward Joserra (Javier Camara), are having sex in the restroom when Joserra is not tossing back shots of tequila or leading the other two gay flight attendants in a campy, lip-synced dance number choreographed to the titular Pointer Sisters hit. The word &quot;marecon&quot; (a Spanish slur for homosexual) gets tossed around with great frequency in the unfunny script by Almodovar, who is gay. The most charitable interpretation of &quot;I'm So Excited&quot; is that it's meant as an expansive celebration of human sexuality in the face of our own mortality. Instead, the airplane it takes place on feels like a flying sardine can stuffed with cold, dead fish. (R, 95 minutes) Contains sex, obscenity and crude humor. In Spanish with subtitles.

It feels like a shameless cash grab, especially in light of the fact that, as the film helpfully relays, Hart greeted capacity crowds at huge concert halls everywhere from Oslo to Vancouver during his 2012 tour. What's next? A Kevin Hart action figure - a tiny plastic doppelganger holding a microphone and shouting obscenities at the push of a button? And yet, there's a reason for all the ticket sales (not to mention the movie roles, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; hosting duties and &quot;Real Husbands of Hollywood&quot; gig): Hart is difficult to dislike. Diminutive and energetic, he exudes comedy with every spirited step and elaborate gesture. He's hilarious, but almost as important, he's self-aware enough to joke about his own shortcomings, which makes appreciating &quot;Let Me Explain&quot; so much easier. As an appetizer to his stand-up set, the movie starts with a fictional scene in which Hart throws a big party. But instead of enjoying the evening, the comic is met with a steady stream of outlandish questions stemming from Hollywood gossip. That's the idea behind &quot;Let Me Explain&quot;: Hart is here to set the record straight. The nasty divorce? It was amicable. His aversion to dark-skinned women? A myth. But just when it starts sounding like Hart is preparing to saddle up his high horse, he admits that the drunken-driving arrest did in fact happen, and there's no good way to talk his way out of that one.

And it turns out that &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; may best be understood and appreciated as one long, baggy homage to Depp, who addresses the myriad personae that have made him the world's biggest movie star, especially the tattooed, bejeweled bohemian primitive that defines his off-screen look as well as the punched-up version when he plays Jack Sparrow. As Tonto, the Lone Ranger's perennially stoic and monosyllabic sidekick, Depp both challenges and indulges in the caricatures that made Jay Silverheels's TV character such a lightning rod for Native American outrage.(PG-13, 149 minutes) Contains sequences of intense action and violence, and some suggestive material.

For now, audiences can only speculate as to the hidden depths of Cavill, who in Zack Snyder's busy, bombastic creation myth is reduced to little more than a joyless cipher or dazzling physical specimen. Produced by Christopher Nolan, who brought such grim self-seriousness to the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise, &quot;Man of Steel&quot; clearly seeks the same brand of grandiose gravitas. But that dour tone turns out to be far more appropriate for a tortured hero brooding in his cave than for an all-American alien who is as much a product of the wholesome windswept Plains as a distant planet called Krypton. Snyder and his writer, David S. Goyer, accentuate Superman's intergalactic provenance in &quot;Man of Steel,&quot; which opens on Krypton just as the planet is crumbling, the rogue General Zod (an alarmingly skeletal Michael Shannon) is threatening a coup and the wise scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is sending his infant son Kal-El into the cosmos in order to begin the world over again. Seeking to cram as much back story as possible into a movie that feels like a reboot, prequel and creation myth all in one, Snyder and Goyer then leap forward to a time when Kal - now an adult earthling named Clark Kent - is working on a fishing boat, haunted by an unnamed past and once in a while jumping into the water to save a crew from a burning rig with his superhuman strength.

But until &quot;Monsters University,&quot; a new origin story set several years before the action of &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; the acclaimed animation shop had never attempted a prequel. You wonder what took them so long, because the characters Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman) are funny enough and their relationship rich enough to make the back story worth telling. Set at the titular Monsters University, the film is the story of how freshmen monsters Mike and Sulley - aspiring students of the fine art of scaring - met and became fast friends. It's also the story of how they became, more essentially, themselves. Where &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was a heavily plot-driven tale, &quot;Monsters University&quot; is a two-man, er, two-monster, character study. Monsters University gets underway when Mike, the tiny, cyclopean, chartreuse-skinned cueball, and Sulley, the jumbo-size, furry blue beast, are both kicked out of the scaring department at M.U., where they've enrolled to learn how to make kids scream. In order to get back into the scaring program, Mike and Sulley are forced to team with a fraternity of losers to compete in the Scare Games, a campus-wide competition. If they win, they'll be accepted back in the department. If they lose, they're not just out of the department, but out of the school for good.

Transposing the manners and verbal flourishes of Elizabethan England to 21st-century Santa Monica, Calif., Whedon finds unexpected meaning in this famously saucy &quot;skirmish of wit,&quot; the opposites-attract story upon which myriad modern-day rom-coms have sprung. Not only does the spiky verbal sparring between would-be lovers Beatrice and Benedick still crackle with convincing sting and verve, but Shakespeare also turns out to have plenty to say about an era when, more than ever, someone is more apt to be destroyed by fast-moving rumors and strategic leaks than by an act of brute physical aggression. As the story opens, the brave and accomplished officer Benedick (Alexis Denisof) is just arriving at the home of governor Leonato (Clark Gregg), whose daughter Hero (Jillian Morgese) soon comes into the sights of Benedick's comrade-in-arms, Claudio (Fran Kranz). While Benedick is being lionized for his courage and smooth ways with the ladies, Hero's sharp-tongued cousin Beatrice (Amy Acker) is having none of it. With &quot;Much Ado About Nothing,&quot; Whedon has crafted an endearing bagatelle, made with equal parts brio and love, ambition and pared-down modesty.

McConaughey's low-key comeback continues with &quot;Mud,&quot; in which he plays the title character as a modern-day cross between Boo Radley and Robert Mitchum's Max Cady. As the slippery central figure of Jeff Nichols's richly observed coming-of-age fable, McConaughey injects a note of danger into a bayou noir story of youthful adventure that manages to be lyrical and sobering at the same time. Aided by extraordinarily assured performances from young co-stars Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland, McConaughey defines his own version of a familiar Southern character - the frightening Other who can strangle as easily as save - as an enduring archetype rather than irritating stereotype. Simple values - hard work, honesty, trust, basic decency - inform everything about &quot;Mud,&quot; from its story to its aesthetic. That simplicity makes Nichols's film something of the anti-&quot;Beasts of the Southern Wild,&quot; last year's art-house darling that depicted a similar world and its marginal figures with stylized - and troubling - exoticism.

The swollen, bloodied features in question belong to Ryan Gosling, who in &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; hands out and receives beatings with such metronomic regularity that they feel like the big dance numbers in bad musicals: showy, artificial and meaningless. In some ways, &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; qualifies as a follow-up to Refn's 2011 film, &quot;Drive,&quot; which starred Gosling in a similarly terse, somber performance. But where that film cleverly addressed its own pulp-crime genre and the artifice of Hollywood, here Refn advances nothing but his own obsessions, which quickly grow tiresome. He has often proudly declared himself to be a &quot;fetish filmmaker,&quot; interested in making movies purely on the basis of what attracts him. The problem with fetish filmmakers is that they're only interested in pleasing themselves; the audience, for its part, doesn't figure. Presumably, &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; will manage to find its share of dedicated viewers - in this case, people turned on by lurid, neon-colored nightscapes, Asian martial arts, graphic brutality, body horror and the perverse thrill of hearing English rose Kristin Scott Thomas deliver arias of vulgar verbal abuse.

Leave it to Guillermo del Toro - that overgrown fanboy with a heart of gold and a mind of impressive philosophical complexity - to bring some sense and sensibility to this summer's crop of dumb spectacles. &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; will never qualify as part of the director's high-end oeuvre - &quot;Pan's Labyrinth,&quot; it most decidedly ain't. But as an example of del Toro's abiding love for comic books, pop culture and movie genre excess, it ranks with his less intellectual but equally imaginative efforts, maybe somewhere between &quot;Blade II&quot; and the gloriously bodacious &quot;Hellboy.&quot; In fact, &quot;Hellboy's&quot; mordant star, Ron Perlman, shows up for a cameo in &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; as a black marketeer working Hong Kong's neon-noir byways. It's in that port city, sometime in the future, that an apocalyptic invasion of sea creatures called Kaiju will or won't be repelled by a ragtag army of Jaegers, 25-story robots that look like super-size versions of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man, right down to the whirring mechanical hearts that glow in their tungsten-clad chests.&quot;Iron Man&quot; isn't the only movie &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; conjures in the course of its overlong running time. The central standoff between fantastical creatures bears echoes of &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla,&quot; as well as the anime classics that del Toro has cited as inspirations.

Sequels are, for the most part, inherently stale, so it's no shock that the luster has faded in &quot;Red 2.&quot; The bigger surprise is just how clunky and unsatisfying this follow-up feels. As the movie opens, CIA retiree Frank (Bruce Willis) has returned to the quiet life, shopping at Costco with his girlfriend, Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker). As he attempts to embrace the joys of the 'burbs while searching for giant bags of shrimp, she's despondent, staring at an elderly couple wrangling a jumbo pack of toilet paper. She craves adventure. Luckily, Frank's quirky former partner, the conspiracy theorist Marvin (John Malkovich), appears with a new plan in mind. The trio ends up traveling to Paris, Moscow and London trying to discern the meaning of Operation Nightshade.

But as soon as Nick meets his new partner, it's clear this is going to be the Roy Show. The problem is that Roy is not nearly as funny as the movie's writers think he is.

James Kirk, First Officer Spock and Communications Officer Uhura in their years as Starfleet rookies. Bright, bold, playful and ingenious, Abrams's prequel to the classic 1960s television show (and subsequent film series) possessed equal amounts of respect and cheek. But mostly it boasted an ensemble of superb young actors who, with every raised eyebrow and vocal inflection, inhabited their characters with uncanny ease and seamless physical mimicry. With &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness,&quot; Abrams proves he's still got the golden touch. The USS Enterprise crew is back - including ship doctor &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy (Karl Urban), chief engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg), Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho). But the casting coup here is Benedict Cumberbatch, who exudes steely resolve and silken savagery as a villain on the cusp of becoming a legendary nemesis. Familiar to fans of another reboot - &quot;Sherlock&quot; - as well as such tony historical productions as &quot;War Horse&quot; and &quot;Atonement,&quot; here Cumberbatch claims a deserved place front and center in a big, brash popcorn movie. As gratifying as it is to watch Kirk, Spock and their colleagues develop the camaraderie that would so optimistically anticipate a multicultural world, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; derives its ballast, and most of its menacing pleasure, from Cumberbatch, who takes tantalizing ownership of a role with near-limitless future prospects for evil mayhem.

It's nice to be reminded of what old people look like, since they are, at least in movies these days, ever more invisible. Based on a true story, the film by writer-director Michael McGowan (&quot;Saint Ralph&quot;) is structured around the efforts of Craig Morrison (Cromwell) to build a more manageable house for his increasingly forgetful wife, Irene (Bujold), after she falls and breaks her hip. Craig, a laconic, can-do farmer in rural New Brunswick, runs afoul of the local bureaucracy when he tries to build the home himself, without plans and with unapproved lumber he has milled. On one level, it's a David-and-Goliath tale of conflict. On one side is a stubbornly old-fashioned man; on the other is the modern system, represented by an equally stubborn building inspector (Jonathan Potts), who keeps trying to shut down Craig's little project for code violations, each of which Craig tries to address with the help of his lawyer (Campbell Scott) and his engineer grandson (Zachary Bennett). Eventually, the legal and technical obstacles start seeming more personal than professional.At this point, Craig rises up in anger as the hero we've been waiting for him to become to fight the system.

It's not even past.&quot; Polley, an actress who has pursued an accomplished directing career with the fictional features &quot;Away From Her&quot; and &quot;Take This Waltz,&quot; brings the past to vivid, astonishing life in &quot;Stories We Tell,&quot; an excavation of her own family that hinges on a long-buried secret, how it's reverberated with everyone it's touched and the contentious ways they explain it. Sitting her four funny, smart, attractive siblings down for talking-head interviews, Polley makes a simple request: Tell the story from beginning to right now, in your own words. They do, and thanks to their observant storytelling and Polley's judicious editing, what unfolds is a riveting drama. Held together by a memoir written and narrated by Polley's father, Michael, &quot;Stories We Tell&quot; begins in the 1960s, when he and her mother, Diane, met and fell in love while doing a play. Looking back, he says, he realizes that Diane - an outgoing, charismatic actress who appeared frequently on Toronto television - probably fell in love with his dashing, intrepid character. Using home movies and original material filmed on vintage-looking Super-8, Polley creates a vibrant tapestry of the facades and false assumptions that form the captivating subtext of &quot;Stories We Tell,&quot; which is nominally about the mysteries left in the wake of Diane's death when Polley was 11.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For anyone who's ever watched a &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; movie and thought, &quot;This would be better if it were a cartoon about snails,&quot; DreamWorks Animation presents &quot;Turbo.&quot; This triumph of speed over slime trails borrows some elements from that Vin Diesel action franchise. It's got a drag race. Nitrous oxide pumps through its plot. Michelle Rodriguez, Diesel's recently resurrected girlfriend from the &quot;Fast&quot; flicks, even provides one of the voices. But really, &quot;Turbo&quot; feels more like a hybrid of Pixar's &quot;Cars&quot; and every family-friendly tale, from &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; to &quot;Monsters University,&quot; that champions the outsize dreams of underdog underachievers. None of which, by the way, detracts from its charms. &quot;Turbo&quot; is a derivative but nevertheless good-hearted movie that's peppered with enough clever touches to engage adults as well as moviegoers of the smaller, squirmier variety. And during a season when moms, dads and nannies often struggle to keep kids occupied, there's something to be said for having an entertaining alternative to seeing &quot;Despicable Me 2&quot; for the fourth time. The star of this show is Theo (voice of Ryan Reynolds), a snail with his shell in the dirt but his itty-bitty, gelatinous head in the clouds. Theo is obsessed with auto racing and determined - against all odds, logic and the persistent naysaying of his older brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti) - to compete in a legitimate speedway event. His wish steers closer to reality after he's snatched from his garden home by a crow and dropped on a sports car in mid-street-race, where he gets injected with enough nitro to make him worthy of a segment on &quot;Top Gear.&quot; (PG, 96 minutes) Contains some mild action and thematic elements. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Andrew Williams, the British writer-director of &quot;Unfinished Song,&quot; uses every cheap trick at his disposal to elicit emotions from the audience, including cancer, a strained father-son relationship and a choir serenading a dying woman with &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot; while standing in the rain. How dare he. And yet, these unmistakable manipulations are difficult to see through all the tears. Thank the two leads, Terence Stamp and Vanessa Redgrave, for that. The formidably talented duo inject so much humanity into their characters that all of the other overly sentimental elements - even the title sounds like it belongs on the Hallmark Channel - seem utterly reasonable. Stamp plays Arthur, a salty bloke who has little patience for anything except his wife and granddaughter. He assumes the worst from people, especially his son, James (Christopher Eccleston). Arthur appears to ask James for favors with the express purpose of lecturing the divorced dad over what the old spitfire will certainly deem mediocre results. Yet when it comes to his dying wife, Marion (Redgrave), Arthur is loving, if not overly demonstrative. They have a playful rapport that feels natural.The importance of the pair's chemistry can't be overstated. If Arthur was an angry, one-note Scrooge, it would be impossible to care about his fate. Even with the tiniest of gestures, Stamp never misses an opportunity to show that Arthur is capable of love, which makes him sympathetic even when he's at his worst (which is a lot). (PG-13. 93 minutes) Contains language and sexual references. At Cinema Arts Theatre.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adolescent disaffection, adult cluelessness and the fleeting pangs of summer romance spring palpably to life in &quot;The Way, Way Back,&quot; a coming-of-age drama that manages some genuinely surprising turns despite the formulaic road it travels. That road is literal in the film's opening scene, in which 14-year-old Duncan (Liam James), on his way to a cramped, damp summer on the Massachusetts shore, is trapped in a car being driven by his mother's boyfriend, Trent (Steve Carell). While Duncan's mom, Pam (Toni Collette), naps, Trent is haranguing Duncan about his social skills, sharply asking the teenager how he would rate himself on a scale from 1 to 10, then volunteering that he'd give Duncan &quot;a 3.&quot; Trent is a nasty piece of work, judgmental and rigid, traits no less eloquently telegraphed for the fact that much of the sequence is filmed showing only his sharply accusing eyes in the rearview mirror. Once arrived at &quot;Riptide,&quot; Trent's cottage, the group is immediately set upon by Betty (Allison Janney), Trent's blowsy neighbor who's a compulsive hugger and prodigious tippler, and whose motto is: &quot;Accept it and move on.&quot; While Trent and Pam become absorbed in the beach town's social life, Duncan gets busy being rejected by Trent's daughter's clique, although Betty's daughter, Susanna (AnnaSophia Robb), shows some potential for self-awareness. Desperate for escape, Duncan bicycles away from the compound one day, finally finding himself - literally and figuratively - at the Water Wizz, a vintage water park overseen by a perennial teenager named Owen (Sam Rockwell). (PG-13, 103 minutes) Contains thematic elements, profanity, some sexual content and brief drug material. At area theaters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;White House Down&quot; never quite seems to decide what kind of movie it wants to be, although by firepower alone it qualifies as this summer's most cartoonishly bombastic exercise in sensory overload (so far). A riotous display of serial explosions, helicopter crashes, car smash-ups, sniper attacks and at least one slap on the face of a winsome little girl, &quot;White House Down&quot; is the kind of celebration of rampant mayhem in which everyone seems to have a rocket launcher - or at least a live hand grenade - at the ready, just in case they need to dispatch a scrum of exceptionally vile and cruel villains. But &quot;White House Down&quot; also clearly wants to be a lighthearted comedy. At least that seems to be the aim in a film that, in the midst of sadistic violence, throws in jokes and bits of buddy humor as blithely as its protagonists toss those grenades. If cognitive dissonance ensues for an audience unsure whether to laugh or wince, that's nothing compared to the level of sheer volume - and preposterousness - the film inevitably reaches for with its we-can-top-that finale. (PG-13, 129 minutes)  Contains prolonged sequences of action and violence including intense gunfire and explosions, some profanity and a brief sexual image. At area theaters.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surprisingly entertaining, even fitfully exciting, &quot;World War Z&quot; is primarily an exercise in expectation management. Forget those trailers suggesting a rock 'em, sock 'em, blow-it-all-up extravaganza or a Grand Guignol of cannibalistic grotesquerie by way of those titular Z's, the face-eating zombies. Instead, be prepared for a relatively grown-up, modestly intelligent and refreshingly un-bombastic thriller that owes as much to medical tick-tocks such as &quot;Outbreak&quot; and &quot;Contagion&quot; as it does to &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and the seminal works of George Romero. Anchored by a solid lead performance by Brad Pitt, who plays a happy Philadelphia househusband pulled back into his old profession of U.N. investigator when a zombie apocalypse threatens to destroy the world, &quot;World War Z&quot; may not break new ground in either of the genres it straddles. But it deserves a certain amount of credit for refusing to buy into the current cinematic arms race in Biggest, Loudest and Dumbest. The result is a movie that, while no classic, can be credited with giving the audience something a bit more substantive than the usual disposable summer fare. For that feat alone, &quot;World War Z&quot; deserves at least a gentleman's C. (PG-13, 116 minutes) Contains intense, frightening zombie sequences, violence and disturbing images.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the first black president of the United States walked into the White House press room to talk about Trayvon Martin and the complexities of race in America last Friday, the people poised to convey his remarks to the world were overwhelmingly of one race - white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when one of the most contentious subjects in Washington is immigration reform - an issue of great import to many Hispanics - the people questioning the president on a regular basis are unlikely to be Hispanic themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But does that matter? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mainstream news media have always been disproportionately populated by white journalists. In 2012, according to the American Society of News Editors' most recent annual survey, 12.4 percent of 38,000 newspaper journalists were racial minorities. The figure for TV journalists was 21.5 percent, and for radio it was 11.7 percent, according to the Radio Television Digital News Association. These figures haven't changed much even as the nation's minority population has increased to about 37 percent of the total, the U.S. Census Bureau says. Among the small but influential subset of reporters who cover the White House - arguably the most prestigious beat in American journalism - the numbers are roughly the same.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 53 correspondents who regularly report from the White House, seven are African American or Asian American, according to head counts by a dozen White House correspondents, journalism organizations and other sources (figures on other minorities aren't available). &quot;There are just so few,&quot; said Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University political scientist who has kept detailed tallies on participants in White House news conferences for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers haven't budged over decades, and may in fact have declined over time, according to George Condon, a National Journal reporter who has been researching the history of the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA), a group that represents reporters in coverage-related issues with the administration. One measure of the group's minimal diversity: Only three African Americans have ever served on the WHCA's board during its 99-year history, Condon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the symbolic nature of the job, the largely unchanging face of the White House media pool has long been a disappointment to organizations that represent minority journalists. In a somewhat ironic twist, &quot;there was a noticeable drop&quot; in the number of black journalists covering Obama after his first election in 2008, said Gregory Lee, the president of the National Association of Black Journalists. The current situation, he said, &quot;simply does not reflect the America we see changing on a daily basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Condon, a journalist in Washington for 31 years, offers a mixed assessment of whether  race makes a difference in how the presidency and the issues surrounding it are portrayed: &quot;You don't have to be Protestant to write about a Catholic president or Polish to cover Lech Walesa and Solidarity. People here are awfully good reporters. They cover lots of things that aren't in their backgrounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, reporters of every background haven't been shy about questioning Obama and his administration about every subject under the sun, including those of special interest to minority groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the same time, Condon acknowledges that a reporter's racial heritage can influence his or her priorities and perspectives and the kinds of questions that get asked at the White House. He notes that April Ryan - an African American who reports for the American Urban Radio Networks - is &quot;often asking questions that someone else would not ask.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 16-year veteran of the White House beat, Ryan has frequently peppered officials with questions about poverty, race, education and other issues that aren't always at the top of other reporters' agendas. She pressed several administrations, for example, about stalled payments to 90,000 black farmers who had won a $1.2 billion judgment against the Department of Agriculture for discrimination in its farm lending programs. She also scored a rare interview with Obama during his recent trip to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview outside the White House pressroom, Ryan said her background, as well as her news organization's primary audience of African Americans, does affect the way she approaches her job. &quot;You are the sum of your experiences,&quot; she said. &quot;You might be able to shed more light on things that others ignore as a result of your cultural background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds: &quot;When you look around that [press] room, you don't see an audience that looks like the country. It's changing - there are more women - but white males dominate. It's still not America you see there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Prince, who writes Journal-isms, a blog about diversity issues in the news media, says the complexion of the White House press corps is important because of the subtle but important role journalists play in shaping the president's agenda. &quot;The White House is quite conscious of which reporters are present, and the president tailors his conduct accordingly,&quot; says Prince. &quot;He knows that so-and-so is likely to ask a question about a given topic. [So] having more people of color in the room means more opportunities for the president to be asked about topics of particular concern to those constituents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince points to Obama's revealing interview with the Univision network during the 2012 campaign during which anchors Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas pressed him on his promise to pass immigration reform during his first year in office. The tough questioning eventually yielded a newsworthy admission: &quot;I think that I've learned some lessons over the last four years, and the most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside,&quot; Obama said. &quot;You can only change it from the outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relative lack of minority journalists working at the White House may reflect a combination of self-selection and discriminatory hiring and promotion, says Doris Truong, a Washington Post editor who is the acting president of Unity: Journalists for Diversity, an umbrella organization for minority journalism groups. Often, she said, minority journalists don't &quot;put themselves on the trajectory&quot; that leads to the White House beat. But just as often, she said, those making hiring decisions hire people they &quot;identify with.&quot; Said Truong: &quot;If you only hire people who look like you, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But economics may play a role, too, particularly among news outlets serving minority audiences, said Kumar of Towson University. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Carter administration, she said, newspapers aimed at African American readers, such as the Chicago Defender and Amsterdam News, employed regular White House correspondents. But these publications have pulled back. Similarly, &quot;black&quot; news organizations such as BET and Jet, which covered Obama on the campaign trail, haven't made a permanent commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kumar notes that such a manpower investment might not yield much since new arrivals literally take a back seat in the White House pressroom and thus rarely have a chance to ask questions during news briefings. In a rigidly hierarchical structure, the reporters who sit in the first two rows of the seven-row room tend to get called on the most by the press secretary or the president. Those seats are reserved for reporters from the biggest and oldest news organizations, primarily the TV networks and major newspapers, including The Washington Post.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If things were reversed, would Martin have been found not guilty of murder? The past American experience of injustice for blacks argues that he would have been convicted of murder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wisconsin Legislature includes many Republicans who are members of ALEC. Gov. Scott Walker is a past member and supporter of some ALEC-inspired legislation, including voter ID and &quot;truth in sentencing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wisconsin leads the nation in racial disparity for incarceration of blacks, yet Walker halted the collection of racial profiling data during traffic stops. Police tell me it takes little time to collect the data.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters of Wisconsin, I'm alarmed to learn that our governor's approval rating is less than 50 percent of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can he successfully run for president, as has long been expected, as an example of what can be done to improve a state if his approval rating is known to the nation's voters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, did we know the popularity of other presidential candidates we've chosen from?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we should always do is read an informative and objective book or at least articles about our candidate choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If more people had read &quot;Shrub,&quot; a book by the late political columnist Molly Ivins, we could have saved the country a fortune, much grief, many lives and would probably be in a much better position than we find ourselves in today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's editorial, &quot;Braun: Time to stop the lies,&quot; is the height of hypocrisy. You accuse him of being a cheater or liar without knowing the facts, just assumptions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by Madison Festivals Inc. to discontinue the use of barium in its planned 2014 fireworks show is a good one and will benefit water quality and aquatic life in Lake Monona and downstream waters. Organization president Rita Kelliher should be applauded.</SPAN></P>

Referring to The Guardian's story, YENI SAFAK published that a&nbsp;source aware of the talks said that Lieberman had not rebuffed the approach but had first sought information on the whereabouts of a missing Israeli airman shot down over Lebanon, Ron Arad, as well as three Israeli soldiers captured in the Lebanese village of Sultan Yacoub in 1982, and the remains of Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy intelligence officer who was caught and executed in Damascus. Daily STAR titled &quot;Dirty bargaining&quot; and published that Liebermann did not object to The Guardian's claims, and gave place to the newspaper's predictions that Assad could initiate etnic cleansing in Sunni areas.&nbsp; - Suspension of US F-16 to Egypt Some dailies also covered the decision by US Defense Department to suspend the pre-planned sale of F-16 airplanes to Egypt.&nbsp;Daily MILLIYET headlined &quot;Postponment to F-16s&quot;, publishing that despite going on with military aid to Egypt, the US decided to suspend the sale of F-16's, referring to declaration of&nbsp;US Defense Department spokesperson George Little.&nbsp;Daily AKSAM published that the US suspended the sale of four F-16 to Egypt, quoting Pentagon as saying &quot;Because of the current situation in Egypt, we believe delivery of F-16 was not right at the moment&quot;, and added the decision was made unanimously. englishnews@aa.com.tr</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, I ask: What now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was shocked when my friend called and asked if I had heard the verdict announced. I said, &quot;No.&quot; She said sadly, &quot;George Zimmerman was found not guilty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hurriedly told her to let me go to tune in to the news on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once I heard the news and analyses of the verdict, I began to reflect back to the times I had served on juries and wanted to vote based on my emotions rather than the evidence and laws presented in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since there weren't any witnesses to the fight, and Zimmerman wasn't compelled to testify, this may have cast doubt in the minds of the jurors. As I see it, Zimmerman was the judge, jury and executioner in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Trayvon's appearance, Zimmerman had determined that he was one of the &quot;(expletives)&quot; who always get away, as he related to the dispatcher, and he was going to make sure this one wouldn't get away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One may ask why Zimmerman felt that way. What was going through his mind? Or had he had negative experiences with other &quot;(expletives)?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What now, after the marches and protests have faded away? What are going to do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, blacks kill each other at an alarming rate - in fact, in the past 20 years, 47 percent of all murders in our country have been committed by blacks, who only make up 13 percent of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't a just black problem. It is an American problem, too. What are we going to do to alleviate this problems and others?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to do something about gun control?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to mobilize to change the Stand Your Ground Law in Florida and any other state?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to improve the conditions of our underserved and isolated segments of our population?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to work to see that all citizens are treated equally in our legal system?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to continue to move away from troubled cities and create own little kingdoms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to stop criticizing those who try to work or associate with other races?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to learn to respect people regardless of race or status in life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to plan to improve our political divisions, both local and national?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to continue to assume that all persons of a race are lawless, just because a few are?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to continue to profile shoppers because of their race?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to continue to assume that some people are incompetent because of their race?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to encourage people of good character and integrity to become our political leaders?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was charged, tried and acquitted in a court of law. Because the president believes the &quot;stand your ground&quot; or similar laws passed by many states are wrong, he should bring a case against the states and not victimize Zimmerman. I am convinced he is not a racist and that he did not shoot Trayvon Martin because Martin was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman shot Martin because he was overpowered by someone who, after punching him in the nose and breaking it, wrestled him to the ground and began banging his head on the sidewalk. How many blows to the head could one take before the next one causes death or permanent injury? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Martin was 17 years old or black did not necessarily weigh in on the decision to fire the gun. Anyone in that situation would have done the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could it have been avoided? Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps if Zimmerman did not have a gun, he would not have ventured out to be a community watcher, or if Martin knew that Zimmerman had a gun he would have avoided the encounter. The president understands when members of any ethnic group are identified as a threat due to repeated acts of violence they are responsible for the image they give the group. This century's wave of terrorism by Muslim men is another example. Even Jesse Jackson has commented that while walking in Washington, when he hears footsteps behind him, he is relieved to see it is a white person.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">CamdenLeast business friendly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Farmer uses some convincing statistics in a July 10 column to make the case for raising Maine's minimum wage, but he fails to tell the complete story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the U.S. Department of Labor, increasing Maine's minimum wage to $9 an hour would make its wage the second highest in the country after Washington state's $9.19 per hour and nearly double the $5.15-per-hour wages of Georgia and Wyoming. Put into perspective, the state that continues to hold Forbes magazine's ranking as the least business-friendly state in the nation would have the second highest minimum wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the impact of a $1.50-per-hour increase on a small manufacturing business running two shifts per day with 10 employees each earning minimum wage. The business would be forced to increase labor expenditures by $60 per employee each week. That's $1,200 total each week and $62,400 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many Maine businesses, such an increase would foster serious hardship. Employers could determine the increase in wages makes it impossible to provide health insurance to their workers or requires they shrink their workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though an increase in Maine's minimum wage is often the first fortress for those trying to improve Maine's economic outlook, it's the simple and often counter-productive approach in my opinion. The reality of the matter is that fostering growth and increased productivity in Maine's businesses is the only long-term solution to improving prospects for Maine's workforce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">This letter is to encourage and remind Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, that she represents Maine people and not corporate America. Give us GMO labeling. I am not happy at all that Collins voted against the Sanders Amendment. I want a promise that the senator will not support any federal legislation that would stomp on rights to label GMOs. I want to know so I can choose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 22, I attended the Bangor city council meeting to address the noise from Waterfront Concerts. I live on Forest Avenue near Stillwater. Since the stage was repositioned, the music, both bass and vocals, has been extremely loud. This is all concerts, not only heavy metal. The concerts are also becoming much more frequent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The business community was very positive about the increase in dollars brought in from the concerts. I just have to wonder how many of those dollars go into the city treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downtown businesses have the chamber of commerce for representation, but I thought the city council represented the citizens. Apparently I was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several older people spoke about deterioration in quality of life due to the noise. It seems these concerts make Bangor an up-and-coming place to do business but a lousy place to live.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military prosecutor spent hours Thursday depicting Army Pfc. Bradley Manning as a methodical, attention-seeking traitor who used advanced computer skills to dredge up hundreds of thousands of secret documents sought by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">In closing arguments in a landmark trial that has revealed details about the largest breach of U.S. classified information in history, Maj. Ashden Fein sought to convince an Army judge that Manning's actions were not those of a perturbed, malleable soldier. The attorney displayed a photo of a radiant Manning, smiling as he took a photo of himself in a mirror. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a picture of a troubled person conflicted by his actions,&quot; Fein said, speaking behind a wooden lectern in a small courtroom at Fort Meade. &quot;This is a picture of someone who thinks he was finally becoming famous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fein said the private's specialized training as an intelligence analyst made him fully cognizant of how damaging unloading troves of classified information could be for U.S. national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manning, 25, is accused of aiding the enemy and 20 other charges. When he pleaded guilty this year to less serious offenses, he said he was motivated by a desire to expose troubling conduct by the U.S. government, from his vantage point as an intelligence analyst deployed in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.Testimony: Bulger demanded cash at gunpoint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOSTON -- When real estate developer Richard Buccheri agreed to meet James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger in the mid-1980s, he had no idea what the notorious Boston mobster wanted from him. But it became frighteningly clear moments after the two sat down in a screened-in cabana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He slammed the table. Then he takes a shotgun that was on the table and sticks it in my mouth,&quot; Buccheri said, his voice trembling. &quot;He said he wanted 200 he meant $200,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buccheri's testimony on Thursday, during the seventh week of Bulger's murder and racketeering trial, was the latest of many accounts of violence and extortion by people who dealt with the longtime leader of Boston's Winter Hill crime gang. Prosecutors are expected to finish making their case as soon as Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 83-year-old Bulger, Boston's most feared crime boss during the 1970s and '80s, has been charged in connection with 19 murders.Family rescued by Zimmerman fears link</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI -- The family rescued from a car accident by George Zimmerman, days after he was cleared of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, canceled plans to thank him publicly because they fear being linked to someone reviled by many Americans, Zimmerman's lawyer said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The family, who really wanted to thank George for doing what he did publicly  realized that in any way connecting yourself with George Zimmerman is right now very toxic,&quot; Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's lead attorney, told CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman helped pluck two children and their parents to safety from a Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle on Wednesday last week after it overturned in an accident on a central Florida highway, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident occurred barely four days after Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted by a Florida jury of murder and manslaughter in the killing of Martin, who he claims to have shot in self-defense.Navy to recover bombs from Great Barrier Reef</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">SYDNEY -- The U.S. Navy said on Friday it would lead the effort to recover four unarmed bombs it was forced to drop in Australia's World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef marine park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. 7th Fleet would take the lead in recovering the bombs, coordinating with Australian authorities to ensure &quot;the environment is protected with the greatest care,&quot; it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are fully committed to redressing any potential adverse environmental impact in a timely manner,&quot; the Navy said, adding it would announce more detailed plans as they were finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Navy Harrier fighter jets were forced to drop the bombs, two inert and two carrying explosives but not armed, after civilian boats were spotted near their original target during a biennial joint exercise with the Australian Defence Force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article &quot;What to tell kids about Zimmerman trial verdict&quot; is a disgrace to journalism and I was appalled the Tribune felt the need to publish it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aisha Sultan's writing (July 22) was a show of extreme bias. I have been increasingly frustrated with the number of people who have set opinions about the Zimmerman trial, who haven't even grazed the surface of facts available that indicate that Zimmerman was rightly acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is what you should really tell your kids about the Zimmerman verdict: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the media makes this out to be an issue of race. Repeatedly, we are told Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin because he was black or dressed &quot;thuggish.&quot; Zimmerman shot Martin because Martin was slamming Zimmerman's head into cement. Zimmerman was fearful for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, not everything is about race. Zimmerman tutors African-American children for free. Zimmerman has black relatives. Zimmerman is a proclaimed Democrat and supported both of the Obama campaigns. Kids, don't jump to conclusions about people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lastly, be glad that Zimmerman wasn't declared a murderer. Not because Martin deserved to die, but because it means that the justice system is doing its job preserving the standard of &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury of six women of varying races heard everything the defendants and prosecutors had to say. Unanimously, they declared Zimmerman had shot in an attempt to save his own life. This is not to say Zimmerman's behavior that day was laudable, but only that he had not gone outside the confines of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is important. It means that the justice system won't throw us in jail one day when we happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Death is always a tragedy, kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's OK to be bothered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's OK to be sad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's OK to be frustrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But kids, ignorance is never OK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2008, the nation's economy was stagnant while North Dakota thrived on a strong agricultural economy and a technology base on the east side of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The start of the state's energy boom caught my attention. At the time, I led a small business in northern Minnesota that I had founded in 2003. While the business had done well and still does a visit to western North Dakota opened my eyes to the vast opportunity in the region for small business owners. Few other places offer entirely new markets where an entrepreneur can enter as the first provider of a good or service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My family and I moved to Tioga, and we haven't regretted it. We have invested money and sweat into new businesses, volunteered throughout the community and enrolled our children in school. We are proud to call Tioga and western North Dakota our new home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As small businesses continue to flow in, the area will become a better place to live and work. Its entrepreneurs will open restaurants, retail, and daily services that provide the simple pleasures of life to us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We feel fortunate to be a part of the growth of the area. The Bakken is full of folks who knew a better life was out there, said no to accepting hard times and handouts and chose the hard work of building businesses and careers, providing for their families, and helping secure our nation's energy supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best news: There's still plenty of room to start new ventures and careers out here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before my family and I moved to Bloomfield in 1998, I had been  teaching in an alternative high school in Brooklyn for five years.  The trial of George Zimmerman for the killing of an unarmed  17-year-old black teenager, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, brought back memories  of stories my students related about discrimination and abuse they  faced in everyday life.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of my students were Caribbean-American or African-American,  whose immediate educational goal was to get a GED certificate,  since their efforts to graduate from a Brooklyn high school had  been unsuccessful. They were a wonderful group of students, who for  many reasons, i.e., low grades and/or being older, were forced out  or dropped out.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Our school, the Frederick Douglass Center, provided them with  another opportunity to succeed as they worked to raise their basic  skill levels toward successful passing of the GED test. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    As I got to know them, I learned not only about their family life  and who they were as human beings, but also about the many ways  they had been racially profiled as suspected criminals and how  hurtful it was to be treated as second-class citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">     These stories included recurring experiences such as: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * walking home at night behind a white woman who picks up speed  when she notices a black man behind her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * getting into an elevator with a white woman. She clutches her bag  and moves to the opposite corner of the elevator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * going into a grocery store and being followed by the manager to  make sure a black man or woman did not steal anything. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * walking down a street, police driving up, pushing black youth up  against a wall, drawing their guns saying, &quot;You might be the  criminal we are looking for.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * hanging out on street corners to socialize since there were no  community centers for them, and being searched by police to see if  they were dealing drugs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * a student driving his new van, hearing police sirens, being  pulled over and then beaten by police as they asked if he had  stolen the van. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Many of my students were angry about being stopped, searched and  questioned by the police, whom they came to view as an enemy rather  than protector. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In class, they studied and wrote about stereotyping of Native  Americans, African-Americans, Latinos, Italians, Jews and other  groups. The majority of the writing was about their unfortunate  experiences as stereotyped, black teenagers and young adults. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    We made a booklet of their writings entitled &quot;Stereotypes:   Problems and Solutions,&quot; and they went to other classes, reading  their stories and telling their vision of a future of equality and  justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    One student wrote to a popular talk show host whose program was  listened to by a lot of young people. He told her about our  booklet, and she invited him and other classmates onto her program. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    For more than an hour, they read their stories and discussed what  could be done to avoid stereotypes; people called in and told their  experiences and how glad they were to hear teenage voices on this  important topic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It was a great project, especially because no one was afraid to use  the word &quot;racism,&quot; and everyone was open to discussing solutions to  the problems that can arise from stereotyping. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    This project took place in 1996. Stereotyping continues, and  extreme abuse - such as the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who was  simply walking home - continues and is part of a long history of  racism in our country. It began with the mass murder of Native  Americans by European settlers. It continued with the enslavement  of millions of Africans and the incomprehensible suffering they  endured; when they protested, they were beaten, jailed and  murdered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    At the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, the United States  took from Mexico what has become our Southwest, consigning  the  Mexican population in these areas to severe discrimination. During  World War II, Japanese-Americans, not German-Americans, had their  homes and businesses confiscated, and they were put in  concentration camps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Today, there is the demonization, arrest, jailing and deportation  of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Central and South  America, often separating parents from their children, resulting in  severe trauma and further poverty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In the past few weeks, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights  Act passed in the 1960s to help guarantee black people and people  of all races the right to vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Research shows that a black person is killed by police, security  guards or self-appointed law enforcers every 36 hours; another  study demonstrates that when the shooter is white and the victim is  black, the justifiable homicide rate is 34 percent. When the  situation is reversed and the shooter is black and the victim is  white, shootings are ruled to be justifiable in only slightly more  than 3 percent of cases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    We are not living in a post-racial society simply because we have a  black president. Racism continues. To educate ourselves more on the  history of our country and the role racism has played, I recommend  &quot;The Peoples History of the U.S.&quot; by Howard Zinn.  In addition, we  can: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * visit The Black Youth Project website, which &quot;explores the  attitudes, actions and decision-making of black youth by including  their lives, ideas and voices.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * join the New Jersey- based Peoples Organization for Progress, an  African-American-led group, open to all, whose goals include an end  to police brutality and foreign wars; for jobs, a living wage and  affordable health care for all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * sign the NAACP petition online demanding federal charges be  brought against George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * make an effort to have friends of different races. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Racism keeps us divided and weak as a people. Whatever we can do in  our daily lives to bring more compassion and respect for each  other's race and culture is a critical part of making our  democratic ideals a reality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The writer is a retired director of Outreach at the Department of  Urban Education at Rutgers' Newark Campus. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Sometimes it's good to be proved wrong. Last week, I wrote a column doubting that President Obama could speak powerfully and effectively about the racial issues raised by the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. Well, the president did just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's remarks Friday - a surprise to reporters expecting the usual daily press briefing - were brief and informal. But they amounted to the most important speech about race our first African-American president has delivered in office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My skepticism about whether Obama should even try to say anything meaningful about Martin's death and the acquittal of his killer, George Zimmerman, had nothing to do with the president's thoughtfulness or eloquence. I simply feared that whatever he said would be misconstrued - deliberately, by some - in a way that robbed his words of their intended meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama began by talking about himself. It was disarming to hear the most powerful man in the world speak of powerlessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son,&quot; the president said. &quot;Another way of saying that is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama noted that &quot;the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,&quot; then narrowed his focus once again to the personal. I quote the next passage at length because, for me, it is the heart of the speech:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African-American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me - at least before I was a senator. There are very few African-Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure I know an African-American man who hasn't had these experiences. What's new is the idea that the president of the United States knows what it feels like to be eyed warily, to be presumed guilty of malicious intent. That gets your attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama went on to explain why, in his view, Martin's death and Zimmerman's acquittal had such tremendous impact for black Americans. African-Americans are not naive, he said; we know that young black men are &quot;disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.&quot; But it is not making excuses for bad conduct to recognize that the pathology seen in many poor black communities has a historical context. Refusing to acknowledge this context, Obama noted, &quot;adds to the frustration&quot; that many African-Americans feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws,&quot; Obama said. He might have gone further and noted that nowhere will you find citizens more supportive of tough law-and-order policies than in poor, high-crime neighborhoods. But law-abiding citizens want those policies applied fairly - and know that often they are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is &quot;a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.&quot; Here the president was guilty of understatement; most of us don't have &quot;a sense&quot; that things would be different, we'd bet the ranch on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president ended on a hopeful note - gradually, &quot;we're becoming a more perfect union&quot; - and proposed a way forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offered federal help to local law enforcement agencies in winning the trust of the communities they serve. If the help comes with federal dollars, there will be lots of takers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gently suggested that states re-examine stand your ground laws such as Florida's. &quot;If Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk?&quot; Obama asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, Obama laid out the challenge of &quot;helping young African-American men feel that they're a full part of this society and that they've got pathways and avenues to succeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the crucial, daunting challenge. Millions of at-risk boys and men need education, mentoring, employment. If this won't come through &quot;some grand, new federal program,&quot; then how? And when?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting Friday's words into action could be Obama's greatest legacy. I eagerly await his next speech on the unfinished business of race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bitter, painful, depressing racial torments were loosed by the Trayvon Martin case. The jury's innocent verdict implied that it's natural for an armed white vigilante to suspect criminality when he sees a black teen wearing a hoodie at night - and that it's acceptable for the vigilante to follow the teen, get into a confrontation, and shoot the black youth to death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the armed vigilante had been black, and the 17-year-old victim white, the case would have been vastly different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama voiced the lament of millions of black American males when he said that he, too, once felt the sting of suspicious looks from whites who assumed he was &quot;up to no good,&quot; as the vigilante said about young Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right-wing commentator Rush Limbaugh called the black president &quot;reprehensible&quot; for expressing his feelings. But Obama was speaking honestly about reality in America. Too many whites see blacks as lesser and menacing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oddly, &quot;stand your ground&quot; self-defense laws have a hidden racial tinge, subconsciously implying that armed whites may shoot blacks if they feel threatened. Since Florida pioneered these &quot;shoot first&quot; laws in 2005, the Tampa Bay Times researched 200 cases and found that gun-wielders who shot blacks were freed at a higher rate than those who shot whites (73 percent, compared to 59 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida International University law professor Joelle Moreno wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since enactment of the 'stand your ground' law, concealed weapons permits in Florida have tripled and now exceed 1.1 million. This has happened during a time when violent crime in the United States has decreased by more than 15 percent. In Florida, despite a growing population, violent crime is down 25 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that, &quot;despite all of the evidence to the contrary,&quot; Florida leaders and the gun lobby have convinced residents &quot;that they must stand their ground, armed to the teeth, against a scourge of violent crime.&quot; She said the state is &quot;encouraging near-universal gun ownership and endorsing vigilante self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;We live in a country where three people die from gunshots every hour, and where the slaughter of elementary school children fails to generate support for even the most modest gun control. We also live in a country where more expansive self-defense laws have tragic outcomes because our threat perceptions are determined by the race, ethnicity, age and gender of those we have learned to fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder said: &quot;It's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflicts in our neighborhoods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial overtones can be heard in this national debate. We doubt that Florida's Republican legislators ever intended for blacks to carry loaded pistols and stand their ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young Americans have less prejudice than older generations. We pray that U.S. society someday will become so colorblind that tragic cases like this won't rouse racial worries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The predictions were dire: Black people would burn and loot America's cities if George Zimmerman was found not guilty. White people everywhere would be attacked in revenge for the killing of Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging from water-cooler conversations, social media and viral emails, many people took these warnings seriously - yet they proved to be largely wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders and scholars say the overwhelmingly peaceful response to the Zimmerman verdict reflects increased opportunities for African-Americans, the powerful image of a black president voicing frustration with the verdict, and the modern ability to create change through activism and social media rather than a brick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was the assumption that black people, Latino people, inner-city people are inherently violent, and that's the farthest thing from the truth,'' says Kevin Powell, whose BK Nation advocacy group helped organize peaceful marches involving thousands of people in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They need to stop racially stereotyping people,'' Powell says. &quot;It's the same thing George Zimmerman was engaging in. To automatically assume an explosion from the Zimmerman verdict - I don't think they understand black people.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOUSTON - Former President George H.W. Bush has shaved his head to show solidarity for the sick child of a Secret Service agent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued by a Bush spokesman Wednesday says the 89-year-old former president acted earlier this week at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. That was after he saw members of his Secret Service detail with newly shaved heads to show support for the 2-year-old son of an agent. The child is undergoing treatment for leukemia and is losing his hair as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush spokesman identified the boy only as Patrick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George and Barbara Bush lost their second child, 4-year-old Robin Bush, to leukemia almost 60 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security detail has launched a website, www.patrickspals.org , to help with expenses associated with Patrick's treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush this week joined members of his Secret Service detail in shaving his head to show solidarity for Patrick, who is undergoing treatment for leukemia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Fucarile lost his right leg and suffered severe burns and shrapnel wounds when the second of two bombs exploded near him and a group of friends who were at the finish line to watch another friend complete the run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fucarile's relatives, doctors and therapists gathered at the lobby of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital on Wednesday morning to say farewell as he headed home for the first time since the April 15 bombings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracy Martin is set to speak later Wednesday at a forum billed as the first session of the Congressional Black Men and Boys Caucus. The gathering was organized to discuss issues ranging from racial profiling to chronic unemployment and high incarceration rates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's appearance comes after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The verdict touched off protests and calls for Zimmerman to face federal charges of violating Trayvon's civil rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occupy Elgin plans protest:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the Trayvon Martin verdict, the group Occupy Elgin is planning a protest on Saturday calling for repeal of stand-your-ground self-defense laws across the nation. The protest will take place at 1 p.m. at the corner of Grove Avenue and Kimball Street, across from Gail Borden Public Library in Elgin, organizers said in a news release. There will be an informal &quot;speak out&quot; at 2 p.m. during which people from the community can take turns speaking about their reaction to Zimmerman verdict. Organizers didn't immediately return calls for comment Wednesday. A Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder and manslaughter charges after he shot and killed Martin in February 2012. Florida adopted its stand-your-ground law in 2005; among other things, the law eliminated the duty to retreat before using deadly force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon protests aren't helping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The George Zimmerman trial has stirred up angry protests against our legal system. The legal system is not perfect and needs some reform. However, these protests viewed in a larger context, do more harm than good. The protests contribute to the polarization of a black and white society and are a distraction from a more fundamental problem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watched the entire trial. The jury made the right decision. If Trayvon&nbsp;Martin felt threatened he had plenty of time to leave the area. He chose to confront George Zimmerman and initiate the physical attack resulting in his death. In Trayvon's world, violence is an acceptable way to solve a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last week of the trial, more than a dozen African Americans were murdered by African American males in Chicago. This &quot;black on black&quot; violence is common in urban settings. Using violence to solve problems is learned early in life. Young children learn most coping skills from their parents. The lack of positive role models for these African American children in their early years make them more likely to adopt negative coping skills. If these protesters want to solve the fundamental issue, they will mentor or be a positive role model for an African-American child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would be alive today if he chose a more rational response to a perceived threat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is GOP looking out for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Obamacare, the premiums on health insurance went down 50 percent in New York. This is in addition to closing the drug doughnut hole, covering children until they're 26 and preventing insurance companies from dumping clients if they get really sick and run-up extensive medical bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, of course, the Tea Party-controlled House of Representative has voted 38 times to repeal Obamacare and almost all of the GOP governors have refused to participate even though the federal government pays for 95 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have to wonder who the Republicans are looking out for. It sure isn't people who want cheaper insurance coverage. Maybe it's those lobbyists on K-Street and their political donors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Minnerick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elgin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The things Trayvon might have done</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama, a Democrat, recently commented on George Zimmerman's acquittal. He said that Zimmerman's victim, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, could have been he (Obama) 35 years ago. That statement struck me as a very deep thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, for all his problems as a teenager, could have become a professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago. He could have become president. He could have won a Nobel Prize for peace. He could have closed the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. He could have fixed race relations among Americans. He could have brought peace to the Middle East. He could have stopped the use of drones. He could have put a leash on the IRS and the NSA. He could have ended the Great Depression II. He could have passed the Free Medical Care Act, a 44,000 page bill which would have fixed forever the problems caused by the Affordable Care Act (aka &quot;Obamacare&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, no, George Zimmerman messed everything up. His audacity destroyed America's hope.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elgin resident Danise Habun posted information about Saturday's rally on her Facebook page. She's not a member of Occupy Elgin, but she supports the rally's cause, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The verdict that came out of Florida was a travesty,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm standing in support of efforts to make sure that something like that doesn't happen again. I think it was a ridiculous verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman should have been &quot;punished in some way&quot; for killing Martin, Habun said. &quot;It should never have happened -- both the murder and the acquittal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't really know what the story is behind it all. We only have one person's story,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe (during the trial) they tried Martin as a defendant, and Zimmerman as a victim.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A common expression asserts that we are all entitled to our own opinions but we are not entitled to our own facts. How about our interpretations regarding a fact? Or our interpretations of someone else's stated opinion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can get confusing, and, as our editorial Sunday reflected regarding the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman controversy, it too often becomes enmeshed with one's individual passions and principles. Two cases in point from this week:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first involves a letter to the editor offering that I rejected this week. We give writers broad leeway on both their presentation of &quot;facts&quot; and their interpretations of them, but we do turn away letters with blatantly incorrect statements. This letter, as it happened, included a clearly incorrect interpretation of our Sunday editorial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began by asserting that our editorial showed that we were following the &quot;typical&quot; media path of portraying the Martin slaying as a racial incident; then, it went on to explain why the writer thinks race was not a factor in Martin's killing. Actually, our editorial had almost nothing to do with race, raising the subject only as it contributed to our larger theme that rather than evaluate the Martin/Zimmerman case on the basis of facts, people on both sides of the verdict seem too ready to leap into emotional condemnations and rationalizations based on their own personal passions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, over the weekend, another reader became outraged by an editorial cartoon that appeared Saturday. It is not unusual for editorial cartoons to generate outrage. Inasmuch as the very format is designed to appeal to emotions first, editorial cartoons have a low threshold for offending people who don't agree with them. But this cartoon, again involving Martin/Zimmerman, sparked a curious response from the reader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cartoon showed in one panel the parental warnings a young black male must observe today -- all related to benign details of the Martin case, the Skittles, ice tea, hoodie and nice neighborhood -- and in another the parental warning required for a young white male -- simply not forgetting to floss. It seemed to us that the clear point, whether one agrees with it or not, was that the Martin case shows black males still must worry about a lot of things whites take for granted. But this reader interpreted the cartoon to be saying that black parents care more about their kids than white parents because they warn against so many other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spoke with him this week, and he refused to back away from his interpretation, insisting that since the cartoon didn't mention Martin/Zimmerman specifically, his reading of the message was perfectly valid, so the cartoon was an offensively racist suggestion that blacks are better parents than whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the record, we don't think that. And if we thought an editorial cartoon was making such a sweeping generalization, we wouldn't publish it. Interestingly, though, I offered the reader the opportunity, which he declined, to complain about the cartoon in a letter to the editor, the very forum from which I'd foreclosed a reader who misinterpreted our editorial. The distinction? Our editorial states its points clearly and directly and nowhere lies open to the description the first writer assumed; the cartoon is what it is and as such is open to readings even beyond what the artist may have intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may confuse slightly the question of whether one is entitled to his interpretation of the facts, but I will say remains true to our policy of erring on the side of entitlement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your editorials on July 2 and July 3: &quot;BART workers' demands aren't based in reality&quot; and &quot;Transit deals shouldn't be concurrent.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am a retired U.S. Navy veteran and currently unemployed, laid off due to sequestration budget cuts, and when public service employees are asking for benefits a veteran would never get, they are out of touch with reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public servants exist to serve the public, not the other way around; what BART employee want is a free ride. They don't have a hard job, and their &quot;improved safety&quot; request is a public relations smoke screen. They need to suck it up just like everyone else and realize they are well compensated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gone are the days when you get a free retirement and essentially free medical. They can join the military if they want a noncontributory plan and truly put their safety on the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please tell us who we else we can complain to who might make a change at BART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also think BART upper management is overpaid. But our politicians are supported by these unions and that's why they remain neutral waiting for public opinion rather than oppose the self-serving unions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personalizing issue isn't leadership</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President spoke this past weekend (July 19) on race relations in the wake of the George Zimmerman acquittal. Unfortunately he did what he frequently does when he's been reluctant to lead -- he personalized the issue and made it about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that 35 years ago, he could have been Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's analyze this for a moment. Thirty-five years ago he was attending a private Honolulu prep school, paid for by his wealthy grandparents, that today costs over $20,000 a year. He was in more danger of getting an atomic wedgie from a fellow member of the &quot;Choom Gang&quot; on the mean streets of Oahu than he was of being involved in a street fight with a Hispanic man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Punahou may be a rough-and-tumble place, but my guess that a student's name on a police blotter there is a rare occurrence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may be throwing sand into your sandwich, but naming of highways and bridges after politicians is moving from the silly to the ridiculous. I mean, really, why should the Benicia Bridge be named after George Miller? Is it just because he has been re-elected to Congress every two years for what seems like half of his life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how do you like the roll-off-your-tongue sound of &quot;Mineta San Jose International Airport?&quot; Not to demean any of the men (and they are all men) mentioned in Gary Peterson's article, but I am guessing that somehow, the powers-that-be&quot; will resist naming the Bay Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Airport after a person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, I could be wrong ... the Nancy Pelosi/Barbara Lee San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge might be right around the corner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New polls reflect growing discontent with politics in Washington as President Obama's approval rate slipped in July, and the approval rating of Congress hit an all-time low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday shows Congress hitting a record-low rating with only 12 percent of respondents saying they approve of the job Congress is doing, while 83 percent disapprove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallup has Obama's approval rating at 47 percent for the week ending July 21, identical to the approval of George W. Bush at the same time in his presidency. According to Gallup, Obama's approval rating has been bouncing between 46 percent and 47 percent since the second week in June. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has Obama getting a 45 percent approval rating for the survey period of July 17-21, down 3 percentage points from the previous month. That wasn't Obama's lowest: He hit 44 percent in November 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Quinnipiac poll a few weeks ago had Obama's approval rating at 44 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These numbers aren't terrible,&quot; but &quot;they certainly aren't terrifi c,&quot; said Peter Brown, assistant director of Quinnipiac University's Polling Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said presidential approval numbers get terrible &quot;when they start with a 3.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is, is he going to bottom out as he did in his fi rst term in this territory and build back up,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Or will he be more like other second-term presidents whose numbers have continued to decline?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said uneasiness about the economy is the big drag on Obama's numbers. But he also cites recent controversies involving the IRS and National Security Agency as problems for the president's popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred Yang, of Hart Research Associates, a polling company that helped run the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, said when he drills into the numbers, he sees Obama's slide as a &quot;temporary bump downward.&quot; That's because Obama's numbers dipped primarily among Democrats, and especially African-Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president's numbers in 2013, from January until now, haven't changed with independe nts and Republicans,&quot; Yang said. &quot;What changed in this recent poll was Democrats and African-Americans. I think those numbers are going to bounce back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yang attributes that dip among supporters largely to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Florida slaying of Trayvon Martin. The verdict was rendered four days before the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When breaking down data concerning the three major racial-ethnic groups (whites, Hispanics and blacks), Yang said, attitudes haven't changed among whites and Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really the African-Americans who changed in how do they feel about the country, how do they feel about race relations, and how they feel about the president,&quot; Yang said. &quot;So clearly they are seeing and hearing things that whites and Hispanics aren't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's eventual statement about the verdict, which came in the middle of the polling and cannot be accounted for, likely will help him with his base, Yang said. &quot;He's been so strong for so long with Democrats and African-Americans, that I think this is a temporary bump downward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yang said the public is holding Congress mostly to blame for its disapproval of Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Congress is seen as the institution that just can't get it done,&quot; Yang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what makes those polled most unhappy about federal government, the top reason chosen was &quot;the partisanship and inability of Congress to get things done.&quot; More than a quarter (27 percent) of respondents said that was their top pet peeve about government in Washington, and 44 percent put it in their top two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing that was interesting about our poll was that Democrats believe that, obviously. Independents believe that, and non-tea party Republicans believe that,&quot; Yang said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only group in that partisan mix who blames Obama or government more than Congress are the tea party Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's in that split, Yang said, that much of the partisan political gridlock begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would argue in some respects what's going on in Congress is that before Republicans can compromise with Democrats, they have to basically compromise with each other,&quot; Yang said. &quot;You have the two wings of the party who really are at war with each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll found that less than a third (32 percent) of respondents said their representative deserves to be re-elected, while 57 percent said it was time to give a new candidate a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And asked if they could vote to replace every single member of Congress, 57 percent said they would. But Brown said recent history - and partisan manipulation of the congressional districts - make that unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now maybe (next) year will be diff erent,&quot; Brown said. &quot;But it's not been the case. One of the things that redistricting has done on both sides is make incumbents secure .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poll respondents were evenly split (44-44 percent) as to whether the next Congress should be controlled by Republicans or Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty-seven percent said they thought the Affordable Care Act is a bad idea, while only 34 percent think it's a good idea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people instinctively recoil from actual gun violence. Human brains seek distance from thoughts of bullet holes piercing our bodies. We want to believe it could not happen to us. We would never be out that late, in that neighborhood, or engaging in such conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sometimes, the gun violence personally reverberates in a way not easily dismissed. That could be us or our child in a movie theater, a public school, a Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant, or the common area of a gated community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When shootings hit close to home, they take on different meaning. On July 23, 1993 20 years ago many Denverites heard the gunshot that ended the life of businessman Tom Hollar. Two gang members targeted Tom and his wife, Christina, in a parking lot adjacent to central Denver apartments and a major supermarket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom was shot dead as he bravely tried to prevent the abduction of his beloved wife. Hours later, several miles away in an alley in northeast Denver, alert Denver police officers found Christina naked and near death in the Hollars' car. She survived. She recovered. She testified. The criminals were convicted and sentenced to prison for the rest of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hollar murder was one of many atrocities that took place in Denver's 1993 Summer of Violence. Court TV and one of its young reporters, Dan Abrams, provided the nation with live coverage of the trial. Dozens of stories were in The Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News. Most Summer of Violence crimes were black against black, but the Hollar murder was different: The assailants were black and the victims were white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murders of white people usually receive more media attention, and that was true in this case, too. In many big cities, murders of minorities by other minorities are considered commonplace and not big news. Media outlets seek revenue and cater to the interests of the majority of its consumers. Members of minority groups may understandably feel that their lives are regarded as less valuable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the prosecutor of the Hollar killers, I was reminded of the case's racial angle by the reaction to the verdict in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Of course, the tragic gunshot death of Martin did not suffer in the end from a lack of public attention. President Barack Obama told us he identifies with Martin, who might have been him 35 years ago. Fair enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But President Obama wanted to do more than just tell us his feelings. The president appeared to telegraph that the Justice Department will not be prosecuting George Zimmerman. But also there, deep in the president's extended remarks, was his condemnation of capital punishment as racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I support the death penalty but, for a variety of reasons, we never sought it for the killers of Tom Hollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents of capital punishment have long argued the death penalty is dispensed disproportionally for the killing of white people. This argument has been well received by Gov. John Hickenlooper. This summer, Colorado's governor stopped the execution of Nathan Dunlap, a black man who murdered four white people in yet another crime from 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama just told us that the African American community is knowledgeable of a history of racial disparities in the application of criminal laws, and specifically referenced the death penalty. This presidential perspective may well influence capital punishment decisions in the federal prosecutions of Fort Hood shooting suspect Nidal Hasan, accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the victims in those two cases were white. On the same Saturday as the nationwide &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; protests, Coloradans solemnly observed the one year anniversary of the Aurora theater massacre. A white man, James Holmes, shot scores of bullets into a multi ethnic crowd of midnight movie goers. Is it now wrong and somehow racist to seek the execution of Holmes even though most of his murder victims were white?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is more than enough real racism in this world without making it up where it does not exist. According to his zealous state prosecutors, Zimmerman was not motivated by racism. The Colorado death penalty prosecutions of Holmes and Dunlap don't seem to be racist. But the governor and president may disagree. And in the end, their opinions matter most.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama said Trayvon Martin could have been him 35 years ago.  &quot;The death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America.&quot;  I think it was a tragedy for America. But not in the way our president does. I view it as a tragedy that all of America had to endure a trial that had nothing to do with the entire country, let alone the entire world. This was a case that should have stayed in Florida.  Regarding African Americans that have witnessed women on elevators clutch their purses tighter, etc. I have seen many Caucasians that would elicit the same reaction. What a racist comment, by the president of the United States no less. There is too much rhetoric and vitriol that is leading us toward the Divided States of America. There were 61 murders in Chicago during the Zimmerman trial. Where is the outrage? No, we need to focus our attention on one shooting of an African American, by a non African American ? by a United States of American. Let's move on with no further discussion regarding this tragedy. Yes, it is a tragedy when anyone loses their life.  Let's find a way to be more united. Israel Grossman Taylorsville  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ORLANDO, Fla. ? The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News in an interview made available Thursday that she feels George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the six-member, all-women jury. &quot;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&quot; she said. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot; But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer of a crime. &quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God,&quot; she said. &quot;And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&quot; Zimmerman was acquitted earlier this month of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 slaying of the unarmed 17-year-old. The Miami teenager was shot and killed during a confrontation with Zimmerman in Sanford. The case spawned heated national debates about racial profiling and the so-called Stand Your Ground self-defense laws in Florida and other states. Zimmerman was seen publicly for the first time last week when he assisted a family after their SUV flipped over on a Florida highway. Juror B29 is the second panelist to go public with what went on during deliberations earlier this month. She allowed her face to be shown and used her first name, Maddy, unlike Juror B37, who was interviewed on CNN last week with her face obscured. Four jurors, not including the one interviewed by ABC, issued a statement last week saying the opinions expressed by Juror B37 to CNN's Anderson Cooper did not represent their views. That juror said the actions of Zimmerman and Martin both led to the teenager's fatal shooting, but that Zimmerman didn't actually break the law. Juror B29 also told ABC that she didn't believe race was an issue at the trial. Though the judge so far has refused to release the names or biographical information about the jurors, B29 said she was 36 years old and Puerto Rican. Martin was black and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Martin's parents believe Zimmerman racially profiled their son when he started following him after spotting him walking through the neighborhood where Zimmerman lived and Martin was visiting. B29 said she couldn't speak for her fellow jurors on the race issue. The other women on the jury were white. Juror B29 is a nursing assistant and mother of eight children who recently moved to Florida from Chicago. She said she feels like she owes Martin's parents an apology. &quot;I felt like I let a lot of people down, and I'm thinking to myself, 'Did I go the right way? Did I go the wrong way?'&quot; she said. &quot;As much as we were trying to find this man guilty ... They give you a booklet that basically tells you the truth, and the truth is that there was nothing that we could do about it.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limmie Greg Curry III's defense attorney made clear Wednesday that certain facts are not lost on him: His client is a black man accused of murdering a white man, and his case is being heard by an all-white jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That can be a very bad position to be in, obviously,&quot; Jeffrey Fletcher told the jury during his closing argument, which lasted more than two and a half hours spread over two days. &quot;... For us to ignore the subject like it's not relevant in this trial would be wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fletcher's comments -- and his plea to jurors to hear the case impartially and protect Curry's rights -- came amid a general condemnation of the prosecution's case. Wednesday, Fletcher accused Curry's associates of framing him, witnesses of perjuring themselves, prosecutors of pursuing a conviction without regard to the truth and police officers of abusing their positions of trust in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curry, 22, stands accused of murdering 46-year-old William Reid on Feb. 3, 2010 at Reid's rural property off of State Route 299 near Willow Creek. Prosecutors allege that Curry shot and killed Reid before burning his corpse and burying his charred skeletal remains at the site of an old marijuana growing operation on the property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crime was allegedly carried out for the purpose of financial gain, as prosecutors believe Curry intended to take over Reid's property and his marijuana cultivation and distribution business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid's roommate, Eddie David Lee, 24, also stands accused of the murder and is scheduled to stand trial in January. Like Curry, he has pleaded not guilty to charges related to Reid's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his closing argument -- which began Tuesday and concluded Wednesday -- Fletcher told jurors that evidence in the case clearly indicates that it was Eddie Lee who killed Reid, and that he then worked to set Curry up to take the fall for the crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is Eddie Lee,&quot; Fletcher told jurors, holding up a photograph. &quot;He is the one responsible for this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fletcher said evidence in the case shows it was Eddie Lee who coached his girlfriend Mariah Foster and his friend Andrew Buck on how to testify in the case. And, most importantly, Fletcher said he also instructed Jessica Lee -- Eddie Lee's sister and Curry's girlfriend -- to testify that Curry confessed to her that he killed Reid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eddie Lee also worked to deposit evidence from Reid's house -- including a big screen television, video gaming consoles and a pair of pistols -- at Curry's apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a setup,&quot; Fletcher said. &quot;It's sad, but it's a setup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fletcher said his client was a student at College of the Redwoods who was concentrating on going to school and was completely unaware of Reid's murder. Fletcher further argued that his client didn't know Reid, had limited access to his property and, in the days after prosecutors believe Reid was killed, didn't act like someone who had committed murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fletcher said that the only reason the case has progressed to this point -- where a jury is now poised to decide Curry's fate -- is that investigators and prosecutors have willfully ignored or even distorted evidence, operating under a mantra of &quot;because they say it, it is so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution in this case called more than two dozen witnesses and introduced more than 600 items of evidence, Fletcher said, and nothing but the testimony of Jessica Lee links Curry to Reid's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, Fletcher argued, Jessica Lee admitted on the stand that she repeatedly lied to investigators about the case and testified that she was telling the truth about certain things for the first time on the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If someone has lied for three years, you have to have a reasonable doubt as to whether they are telling the truth now,&quot; Fletcher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a brief rebuttal argument, Humboldt County District Attorney Paul Gallegos said Jessica Lee's testimony is corroborated by statements the jury heard from the defendant himself. Gallegos pointed to recordings of a pair of phone calls Curry made from jail -- one to Jessica Lee and the other to his mother -- after his arrest on an outstanding warrant the day after Reid's alleged murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the call to Jessica Lee, Curry asks if police found his &quot;BB gun&quot; while searching his apartment, following the question by asking his girlfriend if she knows what he means. Gallegos said Curry is clearly speaking in code, and argued he was really inquiring about a pair of pistols that officers later found under his mattress and believe were used in the murder. In the other call -- which was placed on Feb. 5, 2010 -- Curry tells his mom that he just got a house out in Blue Lake two days earlier, which Gallegos argued was a reference to Reid's property that helps corroborate Jessica Lee's testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toward the end of his closing statement, Fletcher brought up the subject of race and asked jurors in the case how they might feel if they were innocent and found themselves looking at an all-black jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What you would want is people who would fight for you and your rights,&quot; Fletcher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fletcher then made a reference to the recent acquittal of George Zimmerman by a Florida jury in the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What hurts me is an unarmed, innocent person was killed and a jury said it was OK,&quot; Fletcher said, after making clear he has no issue with stand-your-ground self defense laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense attorney then said he has confidence in Curry's jury because he went through the process of choosing each juror and made a point in that selection process of asking each of them about the topics of race and defendants' rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was beautiful to hear you speak,&quot; Fletcher said. &quot;I loved it and I believed it. And, now is the test of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fletcher went on to quote the Declaration of Independence in urging the jury to defend Curry's rights and set &quot;this young man free,&quot; sending a message to the District Attorney's Office that these types of prosecutions &quot;will not be tolerated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his rebuttal argument, Gallegos said that if this jury decides this case based on race, or the outcome of another trial, it would be an outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallegos then retrieved a photograph of Reid and held it up for the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All men, regardless of race, are endowed with certain unalienable rights, and one of these is not to be murdered,&quot; Gallegos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors are expected to receive a final legal instruction from the judge this morning before beginning deliberations in Curry's case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahwah - Township residents and religious leaders gathered for a  &quot;peaceful demonstration&quot; to remember Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old  who was shot and killed more than a year ago in Florida, and George  Zimmerman, who over the weekend was cleared of all charges related  to the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I am Trayvon,&quot; &quot;Prayers for the Martin family,&quot; &quot;Justice for  Trayvon&quot; and &quot;Trayvon could have been my son,&quot; were among the  messages on posters waved by a group of about 40 people who  convened at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 16, at Ridge Road and MacArthur  Boulevard before proceeding to the municipal building at 475  Corporate Drive to hold public prayers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Organizer Pamela Davis, 25, a registered nurse who had lived in the  township for more than 20 years and recently moved to Hackensack,  said that immediately after the verdict was announced on Saturday,  July 13, &quot;members of my church, community, and [former high] school  took to social media to express themselves.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I went through the Mahwah school system and I know what it's like  to live in Mahwah and feel like you have no voice,&quot; Davis, a 2006  Mahwah High School graduate, said prior to the rally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    She said her &quot;inspiration&quot; for coordinating the hour-long event  came from reading the Facebook status of a fellow graduate, Jessie  Hewing, 19, which reflected feelings of &quot;disappointment&quot; and  &quot;discouragement&quot; after the verdict was announced. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;We grow up thinking if you live your life right, justice will  always prevail,&quot; Davis said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;But the outcome of this case was discouraging.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    She said she organized the event for members of the community to  express their feelings about the case in a &quot;positive light, with  positive, healthy discussions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Davis, who volunteers as a Sunday school teacher in the township at  Mt. Zion A.M.E. Church at 106 Grove St., was joined by members of  her church, former high school peers, and others in the rally,  which started with the group entering the corner 7-Eleven  convenience store one by one to purchase a bag of Skittles and a  bottle of iced tea - the same snacks Martin was said to have  purchases before being gunned down on his way home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Hewing and Davis shared memories of walking to the corner 7-Eleven  to buy a bag of candy and a drink when they were in high school. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Trayvon could have been any one of us,&quot; Davis said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The group marched 1.5 miles to the front steps of the municipal  building, where Davis, Hewing and Pastor Kenneth Heyman of Mt. Zion  A.M.E. Church addressed the audience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I know what it's like to live as a black man in the suburbs and in  the inner city,&quot; said Hewing, who went through the Mahwah public  school system and graduated in 2012 from the high school. He said  he spent most of his summers visiting family in Columbus, Ohio,  where he now attends community college, working on an associate of  arts degree. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I take value in my American heritage and my citizenship, but the  verdict made me question if America takes value in me,&quot; Hewing told  the quiet crowd. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;Whatever color you may be...you are somebody and you have to stand  up for what you feel is right,&quot; Heyman said when he took his turn  on the steps. &quot;We're not angry; we're disappointed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;We have to walk in unity. We have to be aware that there can be  unity in diversity.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director and star of Sundance hit Fruitvale Station are set to dramatically enter the mainstream after being taken on by Hollywood studio MGM to work on Creed, a spinoff from the blockbusting Rocky movies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan Coogler, who wrote and directed Fruitvale Station, an account of the real-life killing of Oscar Grant by a transit policeman in Oakland, California in 2008, is now set to direct and co-write Creed, what in effect will be the seventh Rocky film. Reports suggest it will focus on the grandson of boxer Apollo Creed, the fearsome heavyweight (played by Carl Weathers) who dies in the ring in Rocky IV. Michael B Jordan, who played Grant in Fruitvale Station, is in talks to play the young Creed, while Sylvester Stallone is due to make an appearance as the retired fighter Rocky Balboa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station first screened at Sundance 2013, where it won the grand jury (dramatic) prize as well as the audience award (dramatic), and was also selected for Cannes. The clear parallels between Grant's death and that of Trayvon Martin led to extraordinary interest in the film it was released on the same weekend as the verdict was handed down in the trial of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry J Enten: Predictions of demographic doom for the GOP are wishful: polling shows that winning big with white voters can deliver <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The faultline in the GOP revealed by the party's internal debate over immigration reform over whether a future Republican coalition should rely more heavily on whites than it already does, or should try and bring more Latinos into the fold to win the presidency, remains as yet unresolved. What we can say is that the last election and current polling suggests that the Republican's path of least resistance is to win even more non-college whites and and to try to win somewhat more of the minority vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Start with the fact that Obama lost a little more than 3pt off his margin of victory in 2008. That swing was not uniform. It's fairly clear that Obama's share fell significantly with white voters without a college education, stayed about level with whites with a college degree, gained a few points with Latinos, and may have lost a point or two with black voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't view the incongruity between those shifts as a sign that Obama should have done worse or better. In any election, you're given a certain amount of leverage by the state of the economy, and you need to use it where you can. In 2012, the parties found the coalitions that worked for them. It just so happened that Obama had more room for growth electorally because the economy was &quot;good enough&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, there is little to no sign that Mitt Romney did worse than he should have, given the state of the economy. President Obama won by a little less than 4pt, when the two best fundamental models (based solely on numerous different economic factors) had him winning by 3pt and 5pt respectively. Taking into account Obama's approval rating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the economy, as the original Alan Abramowitz model does, shows Obama should have won by a little more than 4pt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the reason why I don't buy the argument that the shrinking white population in this country necessarily spells doom for the Republicans. This is a two-party system where the economy almost always dictates who wins and loses elections. No one has yet proved that the 2012 election indicates that the Republican party needs to change fundamentally in order to win, despite hundreds of column inches expended on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Republicans to win, they'd need a slightly more favorable economic conditions for the out-party. Following the 2012 pattern, this would allow them to continue to do exponentially better among the white working class. Sean Trende, who believes that Republicans could win with a mostly white coalition, gives Republicans a few more points among minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, many doubt this steady-state strategy could work for Republicans. Karl Rove said a few months ago that Republicans would have a hard time regularly winning the white vote by 25pt or more. But that's the funny thing about electoral rules: they're made to be broken. For example, the aforementioned Alan Abramowitz said that Republicans would have a very hard time getting above the 58% of the white vote in 2010 that they had in 1994. In fact, they won 62% of the white vote in the last midterms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why Trende has vigorously argued that the demographic wall facing the GOP doesn't really exist. The worsening Democratic performance among white voters we have seen recently among is part of a longstanding trend. If the pattern continues, then white support for Democrats will continue to drop below its current historic low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, now we have a test case of sorts in 2014. The economy really hasn't gone south. Economic confidence is far higher than it was at the beginning of 2013, although it has stalled slightly. The percentage of those who view economic recovery as imminenthas fallen slightly over the past few months, but it's only slightly lower than where it was at the time of the 2012 election. Put another way, there hasn't been that level of decline in the economy which many thought would need to happen for Republicans to win with the coalition they have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Obama's net approval rating with white voters is no better than -25pt right now. His approval in Gallup's polling among white voters since the NSA leaks is now only 34.5%. That's a 4.5pt drop since the election. Pew has it slightly lower, at 33%, which is a 6pt drop off what Obama was showing in their final pre-election poll last year. It seems as though that wall keeps moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most, if not all, of this drop for Obama is among whites without a college degree. Pew found support from that segment of the electorate dropping by a little less than 10pt. In other words, there is a continuity here with the November election result, in which Obama's support fell the furthest among whites without a college degree. If you think this might be pegged to public reaction to the Trayvon Martin case, the Zimmerman verdict and the president's response, it's not. Pew found college-educated whites reacted in the same way as non-college-educated whites to that issue - yet Obama has seen no decline in his standing among college-educated white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the swing looks much as expected: we have that drop among the non-college-educated whites, and among minorities to a smaller degree. We can see this by pooling Gallup's data since the Edward Snowden/NSA affair; this gives us a very large sample size. That's important because minority sample size in polls is often very small, which is why Pew and NBC News/Wall Street Journal differed so much in their minority findings this week. Gallup splits the difference and discovers that non-white approval of Obama has fallen since the election by 4pt, or about half of the drop we've seen with non-college-educated whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, things could change and this analysis may end up way out-of-date come 2016. I should also add that the eventual party coalitions may look somewhat different then, with Republicans winning back some African-American voters once Obama is out of office, but maybe also Democrats making a slight recovery with white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most salient fact is that Obama's approval among registered voters is a weak 45% - and that's without a bad dip in the economy or any grave scandal. This soft approval rating gives credence to what the polling suggests: that Republican party is most likely to win the White House in 2016 with a coalition that includes even more non-college-educated whites and a slight increase among minority voters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no signs, no banners and no angry words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, there was emotion in their hearts as the dozen members of Hamilton's black community took part in a march Wednesday to demonstrate solidarity with those opposed to the verdict in the killing of Florida teen Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ajid Lockhart, 67, said the not-guilty verdict given to George Zimmerman on July 13 is a hot topic in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my circle, everybody is talking about it,&quot; said the member of the Dominica Association of Hamilton. &quot;I think it was unjust. The guy got away with a crime. It was a one-sided affair, as far as I'm concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marchers started the solidarity walk at Barton Street and Birch Avenue, near the Afghan Islamic Cultural Centre of Hamilton, in late afternoon. About 90 minutes later, they ended at the City Centre at James Street North and York Boulevard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The walk was organized by a group calling itself The Only Good Negro Social Club, which apparently meets at the rear of the Afghan centre. The club lists its address as 593 Barton St. E. A poster for the march was created by Paula Cromwell Montoute. Hamilton police were told about the march by Carlson Cromwell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The walk followed hundreds of similar events which have taken place since the verdict was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was shot dead by Zimmerman on Feb. 26, 2012. The 17-year-old was walking back from a store in Sanford, Fla., to the home of his father's fianc&eacute;e when he got into a confrontation with Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman argued the shooting was in self defence. He was acquitted of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judy Lockhart, 41, said she came to the march because she wanted to bring awareness to what happened to Martin &quot;because there was no justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She would support the United States government filing civil rights charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jhlia Brown, 12, did not like the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't really get it,&quot; said Brown, who is going into Grade 7 at Gordon Price Elementary School on the west Mountain. &quot;I didn't think it was the fair, the way they dealt with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean Gibson, a well-known member of the black community, came out with his two daughters. He said it didn't matter how many people were at the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people who came out really cared,&quot; he said. &quot;This kid was attacked by this gentleman ... If the races were reversed - if it was a white guy who got shot by a black kid - the verdict would have been extremely different.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I heard about the state House and Senate's proposed budget, I was flabbergasted to hear that included among the seemingly relentless attacks on educators is the removal of the pay bump that currently comes with a master's degree. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, in addition to teachers' pay being frozen for five years - a wound this budget makes no attempt to bandage. I remember hearing whispers of this being included in the budget but found it too ludicrous an idea to consider. Unfortunately, that buzz now has behind it a sting that will be felt for me and my wife, as we are accruing debt to pay for two Master of School Administration degrees at UNC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of us would like more time in the classroom before moving on to administrative roles, but our federal student aid loans will begin coming due soon after our degrees are awarded. Thanks to this looming budget, there will be no 12 percent raise with which to repay those loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am weighing heavily my options about whether or not to continue with this degree. Even the intrinsic desire to be a better teacher would not be enough to overcome the economic disincentive this budget creates toward higher education. It might be wiser to seek a master's in a different field. Or maybe I should seek employment in a different state. After all, North Carolina ranks 46th nationally in teacher pay. We rank dead last when looking at teacher pay across the last decade. Better options exist.</SPAN></P>

Get over there today, Rev. Barber. A cult kills a child and woman and buries them in somebody's yard. Where's the outrage, Rev. Barber?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bing called from Detroit and is willing to give you free housing, says he needs to blame some white folks and figures you can ferret out the few who are left. Do yourself a favor - go on a diet and get a job. Raleigh will be your Selma? You insult the people who were in Selma.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was told many years ago, if I had nothing to say, say nothing, listen and maybe I will learn something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This advice still holds true. Janet Weinberg's Letter to the Editor isn't worth criticizing because she doesn't have a clue about what the George Zimmerman trial was about. It's quite obvious she is color blind to history. So reviewing the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin trial would be a waste of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hopefully someone who's not consumed in the one-dimensional world she seems to occupy will understand. Where were Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's civil rights?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the George Zimmerman murder trial is over, let's hope we've heard the last of the awkward term &quot;white Hispanic.&quot; For the most part, it is a media concoction that has only served to stir resentment from both whites and Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whites think the media were intent on telling a tragic tale in terms of a white villain and a black victim, and so that's why they tacked on the modifier &quot;white&quot; before &quot;Hispanic.&quot; Hispanics are just as cynical. They believe that a half-white, half-Hispanic person who wins the Nobel Peace Prize will likely be referred to as &quot;white&quot; but one who kills an unarmed black youth and becomes a reviled member of society will always be called &quot;Hispanic.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to multicultural America, circa 2013, where you can't tell the players without a program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confusion started just a few days after the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting when Robert Zimmerman Sr. insisted that his son George couldn't be racist because, well, after all, he's Hispanic. Soon thereafter, Robert Jr. seconded the motion, telling reporters that his brother identified himself as &quot;Hispanic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure the Zimmermans meant well, but they tried to defend George based on the faulty assumption that Hispanics couldn't be racist. That would mean Hispanics couldn't be human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may never be sure just how authentically &quot;Hispanic&quot; George Zimmerman really is or how much he relates to the language, food and culture of his mother, who was born in Peru. Like many people with mixed cultural backgrounds, the 29-year-old was able to choose, I suspect, whether to identify more with his mother or his father, who is white and of German descent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, since the verdict, when liberals feel like slamming Zimmerman, a lot of them forget the &quot;white&quot; part and take the express train right to &quot;Hispanic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit A is Nancy Grace, the HLN talk-show host, who was upset over comments from Zimmerman defense attorney Mark O'Mara about how his client should be given back his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give Zimmerman back his life?&quot; she questioned on her show. &quot;He's out on bond driving through Taco Bell every night, having a churro. You know, long story short, he's got his life. Who is going to give life back to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin? I find that, at the very least, a very poor choice of words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace's word choice was worse. Not only are her comments racist, they're also inaccurate. Zimmerman isn't Mexican. He's half-Peruvian. Guess what? Tacos and churros are not big in Peru. I don't know whether to wash out Grace's mouth or hand her an atlas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beginning of this story, the media haven't known what to do with Zimmerman, or where to put him in America's racial and ethnic spectrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media reports say that Zimmerman's voter registration record lists him as &quot;Hispanic,&quot; and that's good enough for me. For better or worse, he's one of ours. However, this doesn't mean that Hispanics are cutting him much slack for the mess he helped create by playing cop and ignoring the admonition of a 911 operator not to pursue Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, Hispanics disapprove of his acquittal by a 2-to-1 margin, and 60 percent of Hispanics say that non-whites do not receive equal treatment in the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that's one reason why the national organizations that are supposed to defend Hispanics have, for the last year and a half, shown no interest in defending Zimmerman. A more likely reason is that groups such as the National Council of La Raza have strong relations with their African-American equivalents, and they'd like to keep it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it's shameful that these organizations can't even muster the courage to condemn what seems to be a rash of anti-Hispanic hate crimes in cities like Baltimore and Houston after the verdict. Besides raising money, and putting on conferences, what are these groups good for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the dominant media narrative in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman saga is largely drawn in black and white, and that most of the commentators who were booked on cable television during the trial were either black or white, you might have thought it would be difficult for Hispanics to find an entry point into this story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No such luck. The nation's largest minority couldn't have avoided this difficult national conversation if it wanted to. And now, unfortunately, we're right in the middle of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My friends are constantly extolling the virtues of social media to   me. Yet, at times I think I'm better off still trying to further   master the ins and outs of email and the cellphone.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Pro athletes might be wise to do the same. Too many of them have   gotten into trouble for their Twitter and Facebook postings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Cases in point: Victor Cruz and the Pouncey brothers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Cruz has been an inspiration to a lot of football fans with his   story. Raised in a tough section of Paterson, he was an undrafted   free agent from Massachusetts who made the Giants and became a fan   favorite with his production, his salsa dance celebrating   touchdowns and his tribute to a young victim of the Newtown   massacre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    But on the night George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the   Trayvon Martin case, Cruz tweeted: &quot;Zimmerman doesn't last a year   before the hood catches up with him.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    As quickly as he can score a TD, Cruz took down the tweet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I believe conversation not confrontation leads to change and   progress,&quot; Cruz wrote in an apology to his followers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    You can bet Cruz's advisors convinced him that such tweets would   lead to his off-the-field commercial opportunities drying up faster   than a California lake during a drought. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Pouncey brothers are another story. Shortly after Patriots   tight end Aaron Hernandez, their college teammate at Florida, was   arrested for suspicion of murder, they posted a picture of them   both wearing &quot;Free Hernandez&quot; hats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Maurkice Pouncey, a center for the Steelers, quickly apologized,   but Mike, a center for the Dolphins, did not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    But Mike wisely said, &quot;We get paid a lot of money to act a certain   way, and that's the way we should be acting.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    That's the crux of the situation. Teams pay millions for these   players to perform, not to use social media to expound on their   feelings. Sure, they're entitled to their opinions about George   Zimmerman or Aaron Hernandez. But they might want to keep them to   themselves. Everybody -- from the players to the fan base -- would   be better off for it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Somebody needs to tell Ike Davis the Mets aren't paying him $3   million a year to bunt. Hit the ball over the fence, Ike. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    * Golf needs more characters like Miguel Angel Jimenez, the   49-year-old Spaniard who was leading the British Open after 36   holes. Somebody with a pony tail who smokes Cuban cigars and drinks   fine wine on the practice tee is more appealing than a  foul-mouthed  Tiger Woods. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent American case of George Zimmerman and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin brought a lot of controversy to the American judicial system. It is reported that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an &quot;unarmed black teenager walking back with Skittles and an iced tea&quot; and George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, met and had a scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In court Zimmerman acknowledged shooting Martin but said it was in self-defence. Attorneys for Martin's family have accused Zimmerman of shooting him &quot;in cold blood&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This incident immediately sent shock waves into the American judicial system with many blacks going into the streets to demonstrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this country we are blessed to have a fairly balanced trading ground. In other parts of the world a black male walking down the street, riding on a train, driving his car is too often perceived a threat, perceived involved in criminal activity solely because of the colour of his skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black women are constantly stopped and have a body search by police officers on their way home from the beach clad in their swimwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial restrictions are everywhere even in business trading activities. When someone faces racism in the workplace, it can really start to take a toll on their work, their health and their overall attitude. It is easily identifiable in inappropriate comments to fellow workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember &quot;Nivea -- my most favourite body cream's &quot;Re-Civilise yourself&quot; advert that showed a well-dressed and clean-shaven African-American male throwing the head of a not so clean-shaven and afro-donning male did not come across too well. The 2011 campaign was axed shortly after it debuted and garnered criticism for being overtly racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some businesses that truly have a culture of insensitivity. On the other hand, there are some companies that have a variety of workers from different backgrounds and ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is good for them because it attracts different racial profiles, some Indians will give you business because you have a couple of Indians in your sales team. The majority of companies that claim to be equal opportunity employers tend to moderate their business relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asian women have a reputation of being passive while African women tend to be aggressive. The reality is that in some businesses you have to employ certain races for the business to thrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This woman once said that business picked up dramatically once she employed a white manager and she went into the background. As soon as the assistant was not available, business crumbled to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to prevent racism at work</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strive to come up with a policy that guard against discrimination and discusses racism. Racism hurts a lot of people if not dealt with quickly. Perpetrators must face disciplinary measures. Whenever possible, ensure that you hire employees from all races and ethnic groups for balance and a diversified workforce. Induction programmes must include your policy against racism and discrimination. Whenever there is elevation or rewards, it must be done in a fair and transparent manner basing it on merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Material that promotes confidence and respect of all races must be circulated. Train employees to respect ideals of respect for each other no matter the race or ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encourage open communication with employees so that incidences of racism are reported. Anonymous tip- offs allow employees to report racism without fear of retaliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Follow up on reports of racism immediately.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is so important a week after the Zimmerman/Martin case, that news programs and commentators have to sit and debate the case over and over again?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our justice system went to court with both sides and both sides presented their evidence, or lack thereof, and the case was adjudicated by Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DOJ is now going after civil rights violations all because black Americans are crying injustice. We have the Congressional Black Caucus screaming and pushing for an investigation; we have a president sticking his business into the outcome and being wishy-washy about what happened. Give me a break. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem has been Monday morning quarterbacked so much we have all lost sight of several things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1) There was a fight and someone made first contact and was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2) Someone overstepped his volunteer position and didn't do what he was told not to do or what he was trained to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had both parties done what was common sense there would have been no fight and death. Had Mr. Martin used his cell to call the police and walked home he would be alive today and had Zimmerman just called the police with a description and last location there would have been no shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Final point -- where is the common sense and where are the parents of these children that take these situations into their own hands?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- David Irvine, Upland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subconscious abuzz with private thoughts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are those who refuse to accept the injustice in the Trayvon murder trial. It annoys them. They swat away at their subconscious like a fly buzzing about their person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the fly, they want questions to go away. Deep inside where they think private thoughts, they know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of us have preconceived perceptions. I used to picture a gay man as weak. With the coming out of several gay sports superstars, I now know this is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember the icon of the Mexican lazily sleeping under the palm tree with his sombrero and wide brim hat. If you have ever lugged a 50-pound sack of oranges around all day to make minimum wage for your family, you know that image is false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the Poles are stupid or the Irish are drunks is as wrong as the notion that our laws are equally applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a family member who has been stopped twice in the state of Arizona. He is a Mexican-American. There was no citation, no question, no other reason for the stop. His response was, &quot;They're only doing their job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My family member's ignorance of the Constitution notwithstanding, these incidents highlight the core of the belief of conservative, white Americans. You must look, act and support their view of America or you are not American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For far too long, white progressives, minorities, gays, women and those who worship a different God have tried to blend into the conservative's color of America. That is the other fly that buzzes around the dung-pile verdict of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Felix Sepulveda, San Bernardino</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coward is as coward does</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a July 16 letter to the editor, a reader from Chino wrote that a police officer was &quot;a callous coward&quot; over the shooting of a vicious dog at the scene of an arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since this reader's daddy didn't teach that reader this life lesson ... if you're not willing to call a man a coward to his face, that makes you one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">ABSTRACT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past month, two high-profile crimes have threatened the carefully cultivated and civically critical reinvention of Hollywood Boulevard. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollywood Boulevard is the West Coast equivalent of Times Square, an urban reclamation project that transformed a strip once notorious for crime, drug-dealing and prostitution into a tourist destination, a thriving night-life  district and the home of movie premieres and the Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But over the past month, two high-profile crimes - a fatal stabbing of a woman by a homeless person and a robbery spree by a gang that bounded past people gawking at the Walk of Fame - have threatened this carefully cultivated and civically critical reinvention, worrying community leaders and presenting an early challenge to the new mayor, Eric Garcetti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On paper, at least, Hollywood Boulevard - with the Chinese Theater, star-studded sidewalks, and open-top tour vans filled with out-of-towners on what is, frankly, a mostly futile hunt for celebrity sightings - is as safe as ever. Reports of major crimes are down 17 percent over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this case, perceptions matter. And Hollywood visitors who already might have been disconcerted by the sidewalk hustlers dressed up as Spiderman and Capt. Jack Sparrow, the wandering homeless people and the occasional boulevard fistfight have certainly taken notice of the well-publicized back-to-back crimes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I called the Chamber of Commerce and said, 'Is it safe?''' Greg Pack, who was visiting from Florida, said as he stood in front of Madame Tussauds Hollywood. ''He said: 'Yeah, it's safe. This is an isolated incident. It happens in every big town.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We were a little concerned when we saw on the local news last night that there was rioting here,'' Mr. Pack said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was not alone. Los Angeles, aware of how critical this strip of the city is to its international image and flow of tourism dollars, has moved to try to deal with the problem, real or imagined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The size of the police force assigned to the Hollywood Entertainment District has increased to 60 from 40. In contrast with a few months ago - when it was possible to walk from one edge of Hollywood to the other without seeing a uniformed police officer - there were officers on foot, in patrol cars and on horseback the other day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City officials are talking about imposing new measures on Hollywood Boulevard, including state legislation to bar street performers from wearing masks on heavily trafficked blocks in Hollywood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police are also talking about seeking more stay-away orders directed at people involved in crimes or episodes of harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When something like this happens, it's a matter of concern - especially having two events so close together,'' said Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. ''It sends out a message that alarms some people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Garcetti, who used to represent this neighborhood when he was a member of the City Council, went to the Loteria Grill on Hollywood Boulevard for a show-of-support dinner the night after the robbery spree, joined by the police chief, Charlie Beck, and two members of the City Council. Mr. Garcetti's office posted a photo of the dinner on the Internet showing him, Mr. Beck and the new Hollywood member of the City Council, Mitch O'Farrell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor, in an interview, described the two episodes as ''tragic events'' but said they did not signal any change in fortunes for the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Crime is down in Hollywood - it is extremely safe statistically,'' he said. ''Isolated events can blow up in the media, because it's Hollywood.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that for every one bad story about Hollywood, ''there are probably 10,000 stories about celebrities being out, music being made, movies being made.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''That's the steady drumbeat that attracts people to Hollywood,'' he said. ''That's always going to be 100 times louder than any one episode, especially after the improvements that we've made.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The robbery spree appeared to be spontaneous, fanned by social media and involving a gang of up to 30 youths, aged 14 to 18, who thought the police would be distracted by a demonstration in the Crenshaw neighborhood in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin shooting. Twelve people were arrested after they roared down the streets, stealing jewelry and cellphones and knocking people down. There were no serious injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks had added resonance because they came after the stabbing of a 23-year-old woman last month by a homeless man who demanded that she pay him $1 after taking his photograph, according to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Anytime something happens in Hollywood - since it's such an iconic place - it becomes magnified,'' Cmdr. Andrew J. Smith of the Los Angeles Police Department said. ''My parents heard about this incident back in Michigan. It goes everywhere.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commander Smith pointed to statistics showing how drastically crime had fallen across the city, particularly in Hollywood. ''If this incident happened three miles away, no one would pay attention to it,'' he said. ''The fact that it happened in Hollywood brings a spotlight to it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Farrell said he did not think the two episodes hinted at any backsliding in the campaign to turn Hollywood around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People are pretty sophisticated, and they realize we are a big city and things happen in big cities,'' he said. ''Our crime rate has been reduced by half in the last 10 years. These are isolated incidents - mind you they are 30 days apart - but they are isolated incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I want to say to L.A. and the world that the police presence is very strong and it's a very safe place to visit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By any measure, Hollywood is a far cry from what it was even 10 years ago. The prostitutes and street drug vending are mostly gone, the boulevard is well lighted at night, and established businesses have replaced some of the drug paraphernalia shops and pornography stores that once dominated the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, Hollywood Boulevard still can be unsettling, and fights and shootings have broken out after clubs in the area began closing after midnight. Tourists have to compete for sidewalk space with hustlers and hawkers who see the tourists as something of a business opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've walked about a mile and everyone is trying to sell you bus tours and CDs and everything else,'' said Chris Jones, 42, here from Wyoming with his wife and three children. ''I kind of feel unsafe for the kids. There's a lot of people. A lot of bumping into you walking, trying to sell you stuff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry Morrison, head of the Hollywood business improvement district, acknowledged that the street characters ''have been an issue for years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It kind of creates a feeling like walking a gantlet,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, she said, she was pleased by how aggressively the city had responded to the problem, and said she viewed it as a good sign for the new administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'd be more worried if there wasn't such a tremendous response from our city leaders,'' she said. ''I think it is actually safer out there now than a year ago. You can see the police presence, you can feel it. People are extremely encouraged by that.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a mixture of terror and fascination, we watched with much of North America the events of the George Zimmerman trial. Like many, we were shocked and saddened when the news broke of Zimmerman's acquittal. How could this man take the life of an innocent teenager and get away with it? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Did Zimmerman's past encounters with the law, in which he reportedly assaulted a police officer and had a restraining order taken out against him by his common-law spouse, not demonstrate that he was prone to violence and aggressive behaviour? Did he not bear any responsibility for directly disobeying the commands of law enforcement when he chose to follow 17- year-old Trayvon Martin around the Florida gated community? Even if one were to fully believe the defense's version of events, whereby Martin confronted and then assaulted Zimmerman in the four minutes between the 911 call and the shooting, did the heavier and presumably stronger Zimmerman not bear some responsibility for electing to fatally shoot the youngster, rather than some other less lethal alternative? Not according to Florida's Stand your Ground law. Signed into law by Governor Jeb Bush in 2005, Florida Statute 776.013 states that a person &quot;has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground&quot; if he or she thinks deadly force is necessary to prevent death, great bodily harm or commission of a forcible felony like robbery. <BR>Unsurprisingly, this has led to some very interesting defenses in Florida's courts over the past eight years. An investigative piece in the Tampa Bay Times analyzed nearly 200 Stand your Ground cases, and found that almost 70 per cent of the time the defendant goes free (59 per cent of the time if the victim is white, 73 per cent if the victim is black). Furthermore, defense attorneys have been found to use the law in ways not intended by legislators. In nearly a third of cases, for instance, the defendant initiated the fight by shooting an unarmed person or actively pursuing the victim. Perhaps most frighteningly, a genuine analysis of Stand Your Ground is not possible because when police and prosecutors decide not to press charges, they don't always keep the records that led to their decisions. <BR>Martin Luther King Jr. once said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We hope that law makers across the globe will take this quotation to heart, and do their best to prevent Stand Your Ground-style laws from being adopted in other U.S. and international jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I S THERE MUCH DOUBT that George Zimmerman would have been convicted of at least manslaughter had the homicide and trial taken place in Canada? <BR>In the aftermath of his acquittal in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 16- year-old black, there is increasing pressure to have Mr. Zimmerman tried federally for denial of the teenager's civil rights, based on allegations of racial profiling.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no doubt that one factor in the sixwoman jury's acquittal of the would-be cop is Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; criminal law. <BR>A wave of such National Rifle Associationbacked laws that began seven years ago in Florida and continues to sweep the U.S. has done more than just establish citizens' right to stand their ground against an intruder. It has added multiple chances in lethal-force cases for people to avoid prosecution and conviction using the same argument - extra opportunities to keep their freedom which defendants accused of other crimes don't get. <BR>The shooting has unleashed a nationwide debate in the u.S. on the validity of these laws, which exist in some form in most of the country and which prosecutors and police have generally opposed as confusing, prone to abuse and difficult to apply evenly. <BR>The total number of justified homicides by U.S. citizens rose from 176 in 2000 to 325 in 2010. When adjusted for population growth, total U.S. homicide rates actually dipped in the same period. <BR>Florida's law broadly eliminated a person's duty to retreat under threat of death or serious injury, as long as the person isn't committing a crime and is in a place where he or she has a right to be. <BR>One area that sets Florida's law apart from those in other states is that with the police and prosecutor having weighed in, a judge can dismiss a murder charge based on &quot;stand your ground,&quot; and if he or she refuses, the issue still can go to a jury, as was the case with the Zimmerman trial. <BR>One of the biggest differences between the United States and Canada is the existence in Canada of a single, constitutionally mandated Criminal Code. <BR>In the U.S., the states have an unfettered right to enact their own criminal statutes. As a result, murder is punishable by death in some states but not others, and some states have &quot;three-strike&quot; laws which mean a third conviction for anything defined as a &quot;felony&quot; including purse-snatching means an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole. <BR>Although the U.S. federal government cannot interfere with the states' criminal-law powers, it has passed laws that have led to the convictions in racially motivated homicides. It will be interesting to see whether the Obama administration bows to demands for such a trial in the Martin homicide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, despite the &quot;tough on crime&quot; stances of the current federal government, there has thus far been no talk of adding a &quot;stand your ground&quot; provision to the Criminal Code. <BR>That isn't to say that facts similar to those in the Zimmerman case might not lead to an acquittal in Canada, since homicides are not culpable if the perpetrators &quot;believe on reasonable grounds that force is being used against them or another person or that a threat of force is being made against them or another person; (b) the act that constitutes the offence is committed for the purpose of defending or protecting themselves or the other person from that use or threat of force; and (c) the act committed is reasonable in the circumstances.&quot; (CC s. 34) <BR>And while racial profiling exists here, too, we thankfully don't routinely arm the likes of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labels and propaganda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 22 article in The Herald,&quot;Fracking films reflect twists in gas drilling debate,&quot; is an excellent example of how labels and propaganda are used to manipulate the public within a dualistic conservative/progressive framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer, Kevin Begos, labels the documentarians, quotes unknown &quot;experts&quot; and then allows an economist, Jeff Frankel, to define fracking in a positive manner quoting security concerns and job growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This dualistic narrative invokes loyalty and emotions through identification with one side or the other, as a subterfuge for a regressive practice that threatens our groundwater, land and air quality. Fracking pollutes groundwater and has been found to cause earthquakes. We do not &quot;invest in America&quot; through ruination of the natural resources or government-sponsored corporate greed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are all environmentalists. We want clean air, drinkable water and unpolluted land. Energy needs can be met by investing in sustainable practices, capabilities we have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is imperative that citizens stop succumbing to the use of communication ploys and greed of specific industries that care nothing about the public good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we going to allow ourselves to be used, or are we going to move forward as an intelligent collective? What we choose will be our legacy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood Watch offers proper training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wonder how many U.S. residents are familiar with Neighborhood Watch programs. They are everywhere, with signs clearly posted. For at least 20 years I've been familiar with and admiring Seaside's Yellow Jackets. (This would be an opportune time for The Herald to do an updated story about them.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighborhood Watch volunteers are typically parents and grandparents, young adults and older teens. They are mentored, counseled and guided by their local police. They walk in their neighborhood as a group, never alone and never armed. They follow strict but simple guidelines, including: observe, report suspicious activity, then walk away. Police will respond almost immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sanford, Fla., George Zimmerman was guilty of more than using poor judgment. With proper training (including the value of courtesy and diplomacy), he could have announced his presence, identified himself and asked Trayvon&nbsp;Martin the nature of his business in the area. Instead, he chose to behave as a rogue, and ultimately decided to stalk Martin. It was Zimmerman's actions alone that created and aggravated the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps blame for the preventable tragedy should be placed squarely on the Sanford Police Department.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When in trouble, pray</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hear the question &quot;What do I tell my son?&quot; repeated in news interviews with black mothers, including Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's mother, to protect the son from trouble, and I am reminded of a TV documentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentary ran a few years ago and it was about a black man in the South. His mother told him when he was a lively young man, still a boy really, that if he ran into trouble with whites, he must pray the Lord's Prayer with everything he had. I suppose that's what the Bible calls heart, soul, mind and strength. Shortly thereafter, he and a pal of his were set upon by a lynching mob. He did what his mother told him to do, seriously, and a man in the crowd spoke up for him and they let him go. But not his friend, sorry to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentary was about him and the black history museum he later created in his hometown in the jail the mob had initially pulled him and his friend from. I believe he'd made a career as a peace officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isn't that just the best?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't run, don't fight, don't hide   pray to God, the great help in trouble, then, now and always.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What exactly was the &quot;allowed agricultural&quot; grading work, without permits, on the proposed Canine Sports Center land for? Grazing livestock? Growing crops?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How would either of these uses figure into a dog park?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherri Reid<BR>Carmel Valley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be better dog owners</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am an unabashed dog lover and one of the most passionate advocates for dogs on our public trails and anywhere the companionship of well-behaved four-legged pals can enhance the quality of our lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our companions, I have concluded, are not banned from parks, trails, hotels, restaurants and other social settings because they are &quot;bad dogs.&quot; &quot;Bad humans&quot; who have no sense of responsibility are to blame and will cost the rest of us the privileges we cherish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have seen more dog excrement on local park trails and neighborhood paths these last few weeks than ever. It's inconsiderate and disgusting and a sure way to make the dog-friendly pendulum swing back to when dogs were only tolerated in the backyard and the dog house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dog owners, be ambassadors and pick up after your dog and don't be timid about educating other dog owners into doing the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austerity and global crisis in capitalism is amplifying racism across the world. It was Malcolm X who said that &quot;you can't have capitalism without racism,&quot; and that remains true today. This current economic crisis bears witness to that fact. The US and Britain are nations where racism is deeply embedded in institutions and social attitudes, part of the political, economic, cultural and historical DNA of both countries, both the historical home of the global project of white supremacy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today not only are they the most advanced nations in terms of neoliberalism, they have perfected the tactic of removing all traces of overt discrimination in law while leaving racism and its devastating effects intact. Anti-racists must redouble our efforts to expose this dangerous increase in global racism. Any student of history knows that when Western economies decline racism rises. That's why we are calling a protest to demonstrate our outrage at the sickening murder of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida last year and the subsequent scandalous acquittal of the man who killed him, George Zimmerman. Part of Zimmerman's defence was that Trayvon, who was wearing a hoodie, looked like a threat. The reality is that racism in both the US and British criminal justice systems means that black defendants or victims are viewed through a prism of prejudice that envelopes them in a powerful culture of doubt and disbelief. Majority white juries routinely disbelieve us and this perverts the search for the truth into grotesque caricature. I could bore you rigid with the disproportionate statistics relating to the massive number of black men both here and in the US who are ensnared by the criminal justice system. Trayvon's case has received international attention, much like that of our own Stephen Lawrence. Both are examples of how the overwhelming power of racism is able to subvert the judicial process to reflect discriminatory social attitudes. Women victims of rape will understand this more than most. Trayvon's case has resonated right across the entire world. Protests have gone global and here in Britain we are set to hold a demo tomorrow beginning at the US embassy. The protest is in solidarity with the Martin family and to add more international pressure on the US to charge Zimmerman under civil rights legislation. Then we march to No 10 Downing Street in support of Doreen and Neville Lawrence's demand for a full judicial public inquiry into the allegation that the Met Police sought to smear the family and supporters. We also demand a public inquiry into the recent spike in black deaths in police custody and the recent unlawful killing verdicts in British courts for both Azelle Rodney and Jimmy Mubenga. We all know the cases of Mark Duggan, Kingsley Burrell, Smiley Culture and many others. We want 5,000 people outside the US embassy and No 10 in hoodies in solidarity with Trayvon. As austerity bites, the Tories are determined to whip up racism and scapegoat immigrants and black and Muslim communities with the ills of the nation. Witness the unleashing of racism and racial terrorism in Britain, targeting Muslim women, children and mosques as a result of the activities of the repugnant and racist English Defence League. The political scapegoating of immigrants, black people and Muslims is the new crusade for this Cameron-led government that is seeking to distract public attention away from the real architects of our economic troubles, the bankers. Austerity is the magnifying glass that has amplified levels of racism in the US and Britain. Our reality as black people is that racism is always routinely denied. Here in Britain we are told that racism is a thing of the past. However the reality of racism has been given dramatic expression by President Obama's recent comments on Trayvon's case where he bore powerful witness to the everyday racism that black people face throughout their lives. Obama spoke of the routine and sometimes brutal reality of racism he faced as a young black man. Of course, as welcome as these words were for Trayvon's parents, they are undermined by the fact that he feels no such compassion for the children of Muslim families abroad. Obama's total support of the apartheid nation of Israel, the failure to close Guantanamo and the US imperial mission all render such words meaningless. His drones kill, maim and dismember Muslim children every day. When we look further at President Obama we see a man deeply compromised by his almost visceral domestic failure to address racism and his utter moral duplicity abroad. Racism is on the rise all over the world and anti-racists must now rise up to meet the challenge of a collapsing economy and resurgent racism fuelled by politicians seeking to divide communities. Join us. The protest will begin at Governor Square, London W1 tomorrow at 2pm (nearest Tube Bond Street)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 25--A history that doesn't go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama used those words to describe the lens through which many black Americans are viewing the fallout after a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's remarks last Friday were cool, calm and collected -- a refreshing difference from the ranting and raving of many of the talking heads and protesters taking over the airwaves and town squares across the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't pass judgment during the unscripted, nearly 20 minute speech, but he managed to both reach out to the black community and remind us all that feelings of racial bias still linger in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By telling the nation that he too has been followed while shopping, heard locks click on nearby car doors and seen women next to him in elevators clutching their purses and holding their breath, Obama sent a valuable message to Americans of all races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remarks first served as a reminder that even well-intentioned people -- who would never for a moment consider themselves racist -- can open old wounds by letting historical stereotypes, either consciously or not, influence their decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more importantly, the president reached out to millions of black boys and young men who were born into a world that foisted this historical context upon them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama said Martin could have been him 35 years ago, he wasn't just reflecting on the lack of progress we've made in race relations over the past few decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was demonstrating that despite the influence the painful aspects of our nation's history still has on our society, young minority Americans do have reason to move forward and fight for their beliefs. His own career is proof of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone, the board included, agrees with all the decisions Obama has made so far during his presidency. But we applaud his thoughtful, candid take on an issue that deep down isn't just about one young man's untimely death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need less debate and more dialogue, and Obama's remarks served as the ideal conversation starter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nepal, July 25 -- President Barack Obama surprised the White House press corps on Friday when he preempted the normal daily briefing to offer his unscripted ideas on the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama departed from his usual reluctance to talk publicly about his personal experience with racial bias, reminding viewers that African-American men-including him, before he became a senator-experience prejudice based only on their appearance, not their personality or behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the African-American community was interpreting the outcome of the case through a &quot;set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot; And he noted that, while the African-American community is not naive about violence involving its young men-they are &quot;disproportionately both victims and perpetrators&quot;-that fact is no excuse for different treatment under the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is striking to compare Obama's deliberate and thoughtful commentary about the tragic killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin with the military tactic that will forever characterize his presidency: killing people with drones. The president posits that it is wrong to profile individuals based upon their appearance, associations, or statistical propensity to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By extension, he believes that, just because those characteristics may seem threatening to some, the use of lethal force cannot be justified as self-defense unless there are reasonable grounds to fear imminent bodily harm. But that very kind of profiling and a broad interpretation of what constitutes a threat are the foundational principles of US &quot;signature strikes&quot;-the targeted killings of unidentified military-age males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of signature strikes began in early 2008, when &quot;instead of having to confirm the identity of a suspected militant leader before attacking,&quot; the New York Times reported, drones were permitted to &quot;strike convoys of vehicles that bear the characteristics of Qaeda or Taliban leaders on the run.&quot; By the summer of 2008, as a Bush administration official recollected, &quot;We got down to a sort of 'reasonable man' standard. If it seemed reasonable, you could hit it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in his first-term, Obama actually authorized signature strikes before he knew what they were, as author Daniel Klaidman reported. When Steve Kappes, then the CIA's deputy director, explained to the president, &quot;We can see that there are a lot of military-age males down there, men associated with terrorist activity, but we don't necessarily know who they are,&quot; Obama declared, &quot;That's not good enough for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, it was good enough for him, though, since Obama vastly increased the scope and intensity of targeted killings in Pakistan and, in April 2012, expanded the practice into Yemen against unknown men, allowing the CIA to henceforth &quot;hit targets based solely on intelligence indicating patterns of suspicious behavior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Jo Becker and Scott Shane reported last year, &quot;Counterterrorism officials insist this approach [of signature strikes] is one of simple logic: people in an area of known terrorist activity, or found with a top Qaeda operative, are probably up to no good.&quot; Indeed, transnational terrorist plots directed against the United States have disproportionately originated from Pakistan and Yemen. But, if you apply Obama's logic concerning the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy, hanging around in the wrong neighborhood or with bad people should not make a person guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since November 2002, the United States has killed over 3,600 people in non-battlefield settings with drones, cruise missiles, AC-130 gunships, and special operations forces. It is unknown how many of them were unidentified men killed only because of their profile and a US claim that they posed a &quot;continuing and imminent threat.&quot; President Obama acknowledged in May that &quot;it is a hard fact that US strikes have resulted in civilian casualties,&quot; though he said that &quot;there's a wide gap between US assessments of such casualties and nongovernmental reports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As first reported by Jonathan Landay, the still-classified CIA assessments of drone strikes conducted in Pakistan over 14 months in 2010 and 2011 found that roughly one-quarter of the 600 people killed were what the CIA termed &quot;other militants,&quot; meaning that they were collateral damage or that they were targeted only because of their behavioral profile. Amazingly, no US government official has ever acknowledged that the United States conducts signature strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day before Obama spoke about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Nasser al-Awlaki-a former Fulbright scholar and Yemeni minister of agriculture and fisheries-published a powerful op-ed in the New York Times titled &quot;The Drone That Killed My Grandson.&quot; His 16-year-old grandson, an American citizen named Abdulrahman, was killed, along with six other individuals, by a US drone strike in October 2011. A State Department spokesperson initially absolved the United States of any responsibility, claiming: &quot;We have not received confirmation of his death from the government of Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have no additional information at this time.&quot; In May, Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that finally acknowledged that, since 2009, al-Awlaki and two other American citizens had died in US counterterrorism operations, in which they &quot;were not specifically targeted by the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over time, other officials acknowledged-always anonymously-that Abdulrahman al-Awlaki had been either inadvertently targeted or was collateral damage. Princeton University doctoral candidate and Yemen expert Gregory Johnsen wrote that the missile that killed al-Awlaki was actually intended for Ibrahim al-Banna, an Egyptian member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Whatever the reason, the available evidence suggests that a 16-year-old US citizen was the unintended casualty of a signature strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nasser al-Awlaki closed his Times op-ed by asking: &quot;The government has killed a 16-year-old American boy. Shouldn't it at least have to explain why?&quot; For a president invested in showing leadership by setting the tone for discussions of race at home, he should answer that question directly. He should then announce an end to signature strikes, since nobody should ever be killed based on how they look or for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, when President Obama addressed the Trayvon Martin verdict, his remarks were greeted with a chorus of amens. Still, I couldn't help thinking about the race speech he wasn't making. Detroit, America's largest majority-black city since the 1970s, had declared bankruptcy 24 hours earlier. It was apparently easier to address one tragic death than to honestly grapple with the misdeeds that brought low one of the most important cities of the 20th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those misdeeds include a history of abandonment, neglect, isolation and outright hostility born directly of the racial tensions that have historically divided Detroit from its predominantly white suburbs, and from the rest of the state of Michigan. Add to the list a failure of leadership on every level &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; from myopic, at times corrupt local politicians who punted on Detroit's long-term debt issues, to a bipartisan Washington policy establishment that has blundered along for years without anything resembling a cohesive urban policy or a strategy for shoring up US manufacturing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And let's not forget the economic misdeeds of Detroit's &quot;Big Three&quot; car manufacturers (pioneers of job outsourcing) and Wall Street (whose predatory lending and casino mentality resulted in the foreclosure epidemic that would devastate the tax base of cities across the US). The year after Chrysler and General Motors entered managed bankruptcies, Michigan elected a Republican governor, an accountant and venture capitalist, Rick Snyder, who bankrolled his own campaign to the tune of US$6 million, billing himself as a technocrat capable of reviving the state's foundering economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snyder, after promptly cutting corporate taxes, saw the writing on the wall in Detroit. Nervous about the possibility of bankruptcy &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; which could have tanked the bond rating and borrowing ability of the entire state &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; Snyder appointed bankruptcy lawyer Kevyn Orr as Detroit's 'emergency manager&quot; in March. Elected officials (the mayor, the city council) retained their job titles but no real power; Orr, meanwhile, would control the city's finances and negotiate with creditors. He was granted near-dictatorial powers, including the ability to break union contracts with city workers and sell off municipal assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, Orr had been one of the attorneys working on Chrysler's bankruptcy, and the hope was that he'd bring the same skills to fixing the city. But there was one huge difference: Obama extended $82 billion in federal loans to Chrysler and GM. In Detroit, federal loans were a pipe dream, and Orr's chief spokesperson has been reduced to floating the idea of selling off paintings from the city's art museum to pay the bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit holds approximately $18 billion worth of long-term debt. About half is owed to retired city workers, who were promised health and pension benefits that Detroit can no longer afford. The other half is bond debt &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; some taking the form of shady interest-rate swaps, owed to the same Wall Street banks that tanked the global economy. Orr took a surprisingly tough line with the banks, offering many of the bondholders only 10 cents on the dollar. Predictably, they balked. (They also backed out on Orr's offer to take representatives on a tour of Detroit's worst-hit neighbourhoods; most likely their PR departments realised the image of nervous bankers rolling through Detroit's urban prairies on a chauffeured disaster tour would make for what's known as &quot;bad optics&quot;.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pensioners, meanwhile, are protected by Michigan's state constitution. According to Orr, though, federal bankruptcy law would supersede that, and he was threatening the pensions with &quot;significant cuts&quot; &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; so the pension fund lawyers took him to court. This is what directly triggered the bankruptcy filing: now the city has entered bankruptcy, any pending lawsuits are automatically suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens next? No one knows. The US has never seen a municipal bankruptcy on this scale. It could take years to wend its way through the court system, with much depending on bankruptcy judge Steven Rhodes. Rhodes remains a largely unknown quantity, though a Google search revealed, auspiciously, that he plays rhythm guitar in the Interminable Equivalents, the house classic rock band of the American Bankruptcy Institute, and that he loves the song (seriously) &quot;Eve of Destruction.&quot; He's also co-written a book about Ponzi schemes, which should help when it comes to negotiating with Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 2012 campaign, Obama hammered Mitt Romney for writing an op-ed titled &quot;Let Detroit go bankrupt.&quot; The &quot;Detroit&quot; to which Romney referred was the car industry, not the city, and Obama's critique was spot-on &acirc;[#x20ac]&quot; allowing the companies to fail would have been a human and economic catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that the other Detroit has gone bankrupt, perhaps it's time for Obama to write an op-ed of his own, explaining the disgraceful &quot;jobless recovery&quot; he's presided over, while corporate profits continue to soar. The day after the Detroit bankruptcy was announced, incidentally, the Dow Jones industrial average hit a record high.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the time for evanescent anger, which is America's wont.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the time for a few marches that soon dissipate as we drift back into the fog of faineance -- watching fake reality television as our actual realities become ever more grim, gawking at the sexting life of Carlos Danger as our own lives become more dangerous, fawning over royal British babies as our own children are gunned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is yet another moment when America should take stock of where the power structures are leading us, how they play on our fears -- fan our fears -- to feed their fortunes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On no subject is this more clear than on the subject of guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is proper and necessary to analyze the case in which George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin for what it says about profiling and police practices, it is possibly more important to analyze what it says about our increasingly vigilante-oriented gun culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry and its lobby have successfully pushed two fallacies: that the Second Amendment is under siege and so are law-abiding citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They endlessly preach that more guns make us safer and any attempt at regulation is an injury to freedom. And while the rest of us have arguments about Constitutional intent and gun-use statistics, the streets run red with the blood of the slain, and the gun industry laughs all the way to the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun sales have surged. And our laws are quickly being adjusted to allow people to carry those guns everywhere they go and to give legal cover to use lethal force when nonlethal options are available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is our America in a most frightful time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Illinois -- which has experienced extraordinary carnage in its largest city -- enacted legislation this month allowing the concealed carrying of firearms, it lost its place as the lone holdout. Now ''concealed carry'' is the law in all 50 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as The Wall Street Journal reported this month, ''concealed carry'' permit applications are also surging while restrictions are being loosened. Do we really need to have our guns with us in church, or at the bar? More states are answering that question in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now that more people are walking around with weapons dangling from their bodies, states have moved to make the use of those guns more justifiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida passed the first Stand Your Ground law (or ''shoot first'' law, as some have called it) in 2005. It allows a person to use deadly force if he or she is afraid of being killed or seriously injured. In Florida, that right to kill even extends to an initial aggressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Florida's law, other states quickly followed with the help and support of the N.R.A. and the American Legislative Exchange Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the N.R.A. and other advocates pushed the laws in part as protection for women, those who were victims of domestic violence and those who might be victimized away from home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The N.R.A.'s former president, Marion Hammer, argued in support of the bill in 2005 when she was an N.R.A. lobbyist: ''You can't expect a victim to wait and ask, 'Excuse me, Mr. Criminal, are you going to rape me and kill me, or are you just going to beat me up and steal my television?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, of course, the law is rarely used by women in those circumstances. The Tampa Bay Times looked at 235 cases in Florida, spanning 2005 to 2013, in which Stand Your Ground was invoked and found that only 33 of them were domestic disputes or arguments, and that in most of those cases men invoked the law, not women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, nearly as many people claimed Stand Your Ground in the ''fight at bar/party'' category as in domestic disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And not only is the law rarely being invoked by battered women, it's often invoked by hardened criminals. According to an article published last year by The Tampa Bay Times:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''All told, 119 people are known to have killed someone and invoked stand your ground. Those people have been arrested 327 times in incidents involving violence, property crimes, drugs, weapons or probation violations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as the paper pointed out, ''more than a third of the defendants had previously been in trouble for threatening someone with a gun or illegally carrying a weapon.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, after Marissa Alexander, a battered Jacksonville wife, fired a warning shot at her abusive husband (to make him get out of the house, she said), her Stand Your Ground motion was denied. She is now facing a 20-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something is wrong here. We are not being made more secure, we are being made more barbaric. These laws are an abomination and an affront to morality and common sense. We can't allow ourselves to be pawns in the gun industry's profiteering. We are real people, and people have power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Eric Holder told the N.A.A.C.P. last week: ''It's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods. These laws try to fix something that was never broken.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must all stress this point, and fight and not get weary. We must stop thinking of politics as sport and spectacle and remember that it bends in response to pressure. These laws must be reviewed and adjusted. On this issue we, as Americans of good conscience, must stand our ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 25--NEW HAVEN -- Activists are brainstorming on the next step in response to rocker Ted Nugent's scheduled appearance in the city next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're a city in mourning right now,&quot; longtime activist Barbara Fair said recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nugent, after a Florida jury found George Zimmerman trial not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, was widely quoted as saying the slain youth was a &quot;dope-smoking, racist gangsta wannabe.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists are working to &quot;make it clear&quot; Nugent is not welcome in the city, Greta Boudreau said recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us who see Trayvon as our son and brother, when (Nugent) comes riding into town, we intend to ... let him know how we feel about the comments made about Trayvon,&quot; Fair said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also concerned that Toad's Place did not cancel Nugent's Aug. 6 show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Out of respect for people who are experiencing so much grief, we think that the business that is based in New Haven, that makes money on New Haven people, should not allow him to come here,&quot; Boudreau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toad's owner Brian Phelps said he's &quot;the venue guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're just putting on a show,&quot; Phelps said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You've got a lot of artists that play here, some on the extreme right and some on the extreme left, and if you tell one side or the other, then you're actually hurting the other side,&quot; Phelps said earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked to name an act on the other side politically, Phelps said, &quot;I don't want to get into that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toad's seating depends on the show, Phelps said. It can accommodate about 750 people, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the publicity surrounding the Nugent appearance has spurred sales, Phelps said, &quot;I'm not sure of where the advance sales came from, but we do have advance sales, yeah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman returning a call to a Nugent associate Thursday provided succinct answers to two questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are there any issues with other venues?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is he a racist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She declined to answer further questions and hung up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fair was a speaker July 21 at a &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; vigil in New Haven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 cities nationwide had been slated to hold demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a Hispanic, shot Martin, 17, who was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the rally, Boudreau began a Facebook page, which debuted the following morning. The Boycott Toad's Place section has 250 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her Facebook page is closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reactions to the Register's Facebook page on the issue have been very strong and very personal against me,&quot; Boudreau said Thursday. &quot;I'm just surprised by the reaction because it's my right as an American to peacefully protest.&quot; s</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her goal is to reach people beyond the city activists, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, if he doesn't cancel the show, we're going to be there and it's going to be pretty clear that we don't want Ted Nugent here,&quot; Boudreau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fair, who said she has been working two decades on &quot;different issues&quot; in the state and beyond, aims to &quot;bring loads of people together&quot; Aug. 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm definitely going to be working with New Haven grass-roots. All of those people will be coming together,&quot; Fair said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both women were concerned Toad's did not cancel Nugent's show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NAACP and some city residents have asked Toad's to cancel and they've refused, calling it a First Amendment issue,&quot; Boudreau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clearly not about the First Amendment, it's clearly about the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fair said, &quot;We do respect that (Nugent) has a right to his opinion. But we don't appreciate that in this time of our mourning he's going to be in this town entertaining people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fair said she was &quot;further upset that the owner won't even consider canceling the show. It's a slap in the face to the New Haven community,&quot; Fair said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boudreau's focus with others brainstorming on a recent afternoon included the other performers lined up for Toad's Place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One idea is talking to other artists to see if they'll cancel their shows, Boudreau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're trying to think about it in a way so that we're not taking food out of the mouths of starving artists,&quot; Boudreau said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exploring lagoon problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another study or committee probably won't hurt, but it's not what our waters need. The Indian River and Mosquito Lagoon are part of a worldwide decline in aquatic resources, characterized by blooms and &quot;dead zones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem is that activities on land bristle with energy and construction, while the aquatic world is left with the same mechanisms that ruled the Stone Age. Modern waters lack the energy and infrastructure to meet 21st century conditions, and restoration efforts based on status quo methods cost too much, take too long, and ultimately affect too little. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our experience with Rose Bay is an example of that status quo approach. In the case of Mosquito Lagoon, a more direct method would be to realize that gravity flow and exchange have been impeded by causeways and reduced channel maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One simple step to address this imbalance would be to install flow deflectors on the footings of the North Causeway in New Smyrna Beach. The footings for this bridge, completed in 1997, are quite large, blocking about 30 percent of the main channel feeding the lagoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another step would be active flushing of the lagoon with flow devices, which can be as simple as the prop-wash from an anchored vessel, sited at key points within the lagoon system to augment gravity flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given current propulsion systems and the relatively weak tidal flow at Ponce De Leon Inlet, just a few modern vessels could have a significant effect on flow and exchange. Taken together, these steps could help tip the energy equation and return the lagoon to a more healthy state. Hopefully a demonstration of the above techniques will occur in the months ahead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daytona looks desperate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It looks as though old, painful lessons have been brushed away in the euphoria of new development on the oceanfront. Wow, let's encourage them to take as much land as they want, build as high as they wish (how about 50-100 stories tall instead of 33?), give as many incentives as possible, and let them relocate anything (like a beach approach and public parking area).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's move the public parking area several blocks away into someone else's neighborhood. While we're at it, let's offer to close all the adjacent approaches and give them a no-drive beach! What the heck, the strategy is to give away as much as humanly possible to draw the big bucks to Daytona Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who cares that the residents don't want to be Orlando or Miami with their traffic and crime and don't want to lose any more beach to no-driving zones or to premature evening shadows. They have old- fashioned ideas about maintaining an attractive, mid-sized, easy- going, somewhat folksy oceanside resort, and don't really want 33- story condo-hotels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forgetting who's boss</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have the local city and county managers and commissioners forgot who are their bosses and who pays their wages? When these people ask for more tax dollars from their bosses, it shows that they do not know how to manage even though they are paid big wages. They should be fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daytona Beach could join its fire and police departments together and the firefighters sitting around the station could help patrol the city, and keep one person at the station to drive each fire truck. Call the firefighters on patrol on police radios, if needed to fight a fire. This would save on overtime and add more police on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cut middle management wages by 10 percent, as they are being overpaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who you want to tax are having a hard time just making ends meet, so get off the gravy train and start earning those big wages they are getting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After listening to the president's remarks concerning the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, I believe he no longer is the leader of all the people in our country today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the second time he has expressed views that show bias toward the Martin case. He now finds himself in the same company as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton. It is unfortunate he did not remain above the hue and cry. He has shown little faith in the rule and the integrity of our judicial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our president should be a shining example for all the people in this country, not just a few. In my eyes, he has failed us in this respect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm responding to the author of a letter on Sunday's opinion page about the George Zimmerman trial. He says that he is sick of it all. Which I'm assuming means the rallies going on across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should try putting himself in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents' state of mind. I hope not, but does the writer know the feeling of burying his own child? Does he think that his parents are having a good time with everything that's going on?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people don't want to be part of the solution, then they will remain part of the problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't forget Benghazi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were so distracted by the Zimmerman trial. Now that it's over and he is not guilty, let's move on to the big news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deep in everyone's heart, we have not forgotten these four Americans who lost their lives. They are gone and this should not have happened. Why weren't these four Americans protected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precious life was taken before our very eyes -- where was President Barack Obama, where was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Where are the parents of these men who, sadly, were left to die in the most horrific way? If this was my son, I would not let this go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will there ever be justice for these men who suffered? Only the most higher-up (God) will ever know -- unless someone squeals. Where are the eyewitnesses? We all want answers to these questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are too many distractions, too many false pretenses. Let's get on the right track and settle this once and for all. Maybe, like everything else, it will be all swept under Obama's rug in our White House -- but we the people want justice, and we will not forget!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENGLEWOOD - Fire Chief Gerald Marion is urging council members to  boycott the state of Florida, as well other states that have &quot;Stand  Your Ground&quot; laws, in light of last week's acquittal of George  Zimmerman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'm here in uniform tonight and I'm telling you this uniform, my  position, [and even] if I was a Nobel Prize winning physicist,  would not protect me in these states,&quot; said Marion at the July 16  city council meeting. &quot;All I have to do is look at someone the  wrong way and I can be shot and killed and there will be no  retribution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Trayvon Martin, 17, of Florida, was shot dead by Zimmerman, a  Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer, last year after he allegedly  became suspicious of the black unarmed teen. Martin's family  alleged that their son became a victim of racial profiling while  Zimmerman claimed self defense. While Zimmerman's defense did not  invoke &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; during the trial, Judge Debra Nelson  used language from the law in her instruction to the jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Marion said &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws - which states a person can  use justifiably self defense if they are threatened without the  duty to retreat - greatly impact minorities, especially those of  the African-American community. Approximately 30 states, including  Florida, have some form of Stand Your Ground on the books. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I don't want to be a target anymore,&quot; said Marion. &quot;I don't want  my children or my grandchildren to be a target anymore. I want  someone to help and that has to start with us.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Marion pledged to not spend a single taxpayer dollar to purchases  good or services from Florida, as much as it is in his power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The Englewood Fire Department currently purchases its fire trucks  from a Florida company, said Marion. Although one department itself  may not make a difference, Marion urged his colleagues across the  country to follow suit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;One of my colleagues asked me 'what's the big deal; what  difference is it going to make,' &quot; said Marion. &quot;But I know if I  don't do anything, nothing will happen. At least if I try, I can go  to sleep at night with a clear conscious.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Crystal Brown, a city resident, thanked Marion for his comments at  the July 16 meeting and urged the council to reconsider a recent  contract with a Florida company that was approved two months ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    On May 28, the city council approved a two-year contract with  Florida-based Federal Property Registration Corporation (FPRC) to  create an online registry of vacant properties throughout the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Bergen County NAACP President Anthony Cureton was in agreement with  Marion's sentiments, but felt the community needed to take more  steps in getting legislators in the assembly and senate to step  forward and stand with the NAACP with issues that affect the  African-American community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;People may close their eyes to racism, but [this] shows it  exists,&quot; said Cureton. &quot;The concept of an African-American man  walking to a store [who is then] followed, that's the true issue  that's affecting everyone. That's a national issue that has to be  talked about.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Rev. Vernon Walton of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, who organized a  &quot;Hoodie Sunday&quot; silent march last March that drew more than 500  Bergen County residents to Englewood to show solidarity with  Martin, said the Zimmerman verdict made the nation more sensitive  to &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Walton said he could certainly support Marion's sentiments, but the  community at large also needed to look at the other people and  companies that supported the Zimmerman defense team throughout the  trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I heard a number of people ask for some way we can make our voices  heard,&quot; said Walton. &quot;One of the fastest ways [one could do this]  is through the pockets.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Walton believed the situation was also a good learning opportunity  for citizens to become more engaged in what's happening on a  federal level and encourage more people to participate in the  upcoming senate election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;The politics are local, but it does trickle down,&quot; said Walton.  &quot;We also have to help young people to understand the impact and  consequences of this verdict.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Ward 2 Councilman Michael Cohen said while he agrees with Marion in  theory, he questioned the practical aspect of not buying from the  30-something states with &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    &quot;I would say generally speaking my preference is to try to buy  local in Bergen County,&quot; said Cohen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Not only would Ward 3 Councilman Eugene Skurnick like to see a  resolution from the council condemning the Zimmerman case, but said  he would also like to see a resolution condemning local Bergen  County towns for recent shootings of unarmed individuals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Ward 1 Councilman Marc Forman, who did not comment on Marion's  statement, said the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws are &quot;appalling.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No justice, no peace, no killer police!&quot; a crowd repeated in Santa Ana on July 18 in another protest over the acquittal in Florida of George Zimmerman on charges in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 60 protesters brandished signs at the corner of Bristol Street and McFadden Avenue and spoke out against what they called a &quot;racist system.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of this is going on in Santa Ana,&quot; said Naui Huitzilopochtli of Santa Ana, who organized the protest. &quot;Racial profiling and racism is in our community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd of about 100 people gathered downtown on July 16 for a vigil in reaction to the Florida acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, chanting &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; and carrying signs that read &quot;Another world is possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt very compelled to take a stand in Orange County,&quot; said Joese Hernandez, 27, an organizer with El Centro Cultural de Mexico in Santa Ana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowds gathered at Sasscer Park around an altar with Martin's photo next to bags of Skittles and candles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 8:30 p.m., protesters peacefully walked down Ross, Main and Fourth streets with candles and fists up in the air. The rally ended after 9 p.m. at the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters carried signs reading &quot;We are human, not criminal&quot; while chanting, &quot;The people say guilty.&quot; A handful of Santa Ana Police Department cars trailed the crowds and monitored traffic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Town hall meeting held at church after Zimmerman verdict. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Howard Reed heard about what happened to 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in February 2012, it brought back some vivid and emotional memories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reed, an African American associate minister at Santa Ana's Second Baptist Church, shared those memories earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That could have been me,&quot; a tearful Moore told the 200-plus attendees at an NAACP-sponsored town hall meeting at Irvine's Christ Our Redeemer AME Church on Tuesday night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore's words echoed those spoken by President Barack Obama last week following the not-guilty verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges in the 2012 shooting death of Martin in Sanford, Fla., while Zimmerman was on a local Neighborhood Watch patrol. The case has ignited controversy over racial profiling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early 1980s, while on summer vacation in Chicago, Moore said he was stopped at gunpoint by police on his way home from a laundromat. He said the officers used racial slurs in telling him he fit the description of a crime suspect. But after the victim told police Moore was the wrong man, he was let go. Police left him to walk several miles to his home, at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Filled with rage, Moore said his only alternative to violence was to ask God to take away the anger he felt for having been racially profiled, just as Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctuary at Christ Our Redeemer's Church filled with stories similar to Moore's, and people of all races and genders shared them, sometimes tearfully. Some even offered solutions to race-related problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although the meeting took place in Irvine - considered by most standards to be a safe community - some residents warned that what happened to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin isn't limited to specific neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have an 8-year-old son and I work very hard so I don't have to live in the hood,&quot; said Irvine resident Darren Moore. &quot;Irvine's a good neighborhood and a good community. But what happened to Trayvon can happen here. It can happen anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irvine police spokeswoman Julia Engen said the city does not have a program where citizens are involved in any kind of crime-fighting capacity. There are senior volunteers who assist police in various ways, but none are armed, Engen said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore said a solution to race relations in America may be as simple as observing the innocence of children. &quot;My son's best friend is white,&quot; he said. &quot;And I love to watch them play because they don't know anything about race. They're just having fun. I would like to see our society get to a place where we think like kids, when race isn't an issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Craig, president of the Orange County branch of the NAACP, said that it is important to move forward after the trial, focusing on the positive and making certain that people of all races stay educated. Most important, he said, they need to vote and make their voices heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't do anything about what's already happened,&quot; he said. But he said it was important to examine some of the laws that came into play that night in Florida, specifically the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, a law in some jurisdictions in the United States allowing citizens to defend themselves - sometimes with deadly force - when faced with a dangerous confrontation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miami </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton told a packed Baptist cathedral here Wednesday night that he plans to make Florida &quot;ground zero&quot; in the fight to repeal &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws around the nation between now and the 2014 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We intend to make the election in Florida and nationally about stand your ground laws,&quot; said Sharpton, founder of the National Action Network, in a fiery sermon at the New Birth Baptist Church Cathedral. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Action Network staged protests in 100 cities Saturday, one week after George Zimmerman, 29, was found not guilty in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, 17, in the Central Florida town of Sanford in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand your ground laws say a person has no obligation to retreat from the threat of violence if he or she can safely do so, but instead can respond with violence. The judge in the Zimmerman case cited the 2005 Florida law when she instructed the jury in that trial. A juror later said the judge's instruction left the jury no choice but to find Zimmerman not-guilty and said she thought Florida lawmakers should change the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin will be a symbol for changing laws,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;We see it as a civil rights violation. It is a violation of people's civil rights to take life and say, 'I thought I was endangered,' and the other person is dead. ... Trayvon&nbsp;Martin had a civil right to go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd greeted that thought and many others during the sermon with cheers and applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is something ... the voters can do something about by electing officials who will change the legislation,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;That's what the civil rights movement of the 1960s was about, changing legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to register voters in Florida by numbers they will be stunned by,&quot; he said referring to defenders of stand your ground laws. &quot;We are going to work county by county in Florida to register voters. We are going to have a stand off in Florida over the stand your ground law next year. You can not allow that to stay on the books. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said his organization would try to form a coalition of whites, blacks and Latinos in Florida to challenge candidates who support stand your ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to do this together,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to go in the trenches and go to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the latest figures show that 1.3 million blacks in Florida are not registered to vote. Many of those are former prison inmates who have been denied the right to vote despite having completed their sentences, parole and probation. Sharpton said his organization would address that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said on Aug. 28 his organization will sponsor a march on Washington in part to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington where civil rights icon the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his landmark &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sharpton said the coming march will also focus on stand your ground laws and on what he said are attempts to infringe on voting rights, especially of blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stand your ground and voting rights will be the theme of the national march,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said &quot;right wingers&quot; accuse black leaders of never addressing the issue of black on black crime, but he denied that is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We talk about it all the time,&quot; he said, adding that a meeting he convened Wednesday afternoon with local black pastor had dealt extensively with that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said &quot;exterior threats&quot; had also been discussed, especially stand your ground laws. He also bemoaned racial profiling in the U.S. which he called &quot;humiliating, frightening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are still seeing people judged by the color of their skin and not the content of their character,&quot; he said. &quot;There must be laws against profiling. Federal racial profiling laws must be implemented and executed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the organized demonstrations demanding justice for Trayvon Martin, the participants in those demonstrations need to accept that justice was served.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the outcome of the trial had been the opposite, do you think the Hispanic-American segment of the population would demonstrate, demand justice and get the Department of Justice to investigate? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juries are for determining who is guilty and who is innocent and judges are supposed to determine what punishment should be meted out to fit the crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism is a reality in America and people of all ethnic backgrounds want it that way. If America is to become non-racist, then there can be no hyphenated Americans. The citizens and the government of this nation need to quit allowing special treatment for race, nationality or religion. We have freedom for that. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By John Timpane; Inquirer Staff Writer</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Friday, social-media sites have moderated - in every sense of the word - public reaction to President Obama's semi-off-the-cuff remarks on the George Zimmerman/Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These tributary media - Facebook, Twitter, and their sibs; the blog world; cable TV - allowed many voices to vent, the measured and the extreme alike. But then the heat diffused - something social media also can do - and by Monday a different tone had emerged, less like war, more like the discussion about race so many say they want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James Peterson, director of Africana studies and associate professor of English at Lehigh University, says: &quot;I think it was just great, both the initial outbursts, and what happened as the days went on. I do think social media played a role.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twitter and Facebook flared with both praise for the president's forthrightness and accusations of divisiveness and racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conservative tweets went out even before Obama's talk was over. Todd Starnes of Fox News tweeted that Obama &quot;truly is trying to tear our country apart.&quot; Ben Shapiro of Breitbart.com tweeted that &quot;Obama helped ignite this ginned up racial melee.&quot; And blogger Dan Riehl tweeted, &quot;If you ever had any doubts, Obama is the first Racist in Chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, some sought more level ground. Contacted in Virginia, where he is preparing to move back up to Lewistown, Pa., blogger Riehl said that while perhaps </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">racist</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not the best-chosen word, he felt Obama insisted on obsolete race rhetoric that actually endangers the welfare of young black men by not focusing on their upbringing and behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Instead of looking forward, this is our first black president and he is intent on looking backward,&quot; Riehl said. &quot;. . . Instead of this man of achievement saying, 'I went to Harvard, I got elected, and I'm sorry, Trayvon should not have been doing what he was doing. This is about decisions, about parenting, about responsibility,' he all but abdicated his leadership on race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much the same charge came from the center-left. The day of Obama's address, TV host Tavis Smiley tweeted that it had been &quot;weak as pre-sweetened Kool-Aid.&quot; Sunday on NBC, he said that &quot;on this issue, you cannot lead from behind. What's lacking in this moment is moral leadership.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some on the left definitely feel it was too little, too late,&quot; Peterson says. &quot;In being a man of different races and parts of the country, Obama gets it from both sides. He's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Saturday, CNN host Don Lemon (once an anchor for NBC10 in Philadelphia) and conservative commentator Ben Ferguson got into it. Ferguson dismissed Obama's notion of social prejudice, calling it &quot;an incredibly broad brush.&quot; Lemon replied: &quot;Who are you to tell us we're not having that experience, when you're not living it? . . . It's insulting for you to say, 'No that's not happening.' You don't live as a black man, you don't know that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contacted by e-mail, Lemon said: &quot;I am a journalist. But I'm a human being first. And as a human being who just happens to be black, who just happens to have been profiled (some of it public record), I felt in that moment it was important to draw upon those experiences to tell the whole story. . . . If you have a special insight into something in the news, it's incumbent upon me or any other journalist to inform the viewers and the person being interviewed that his or her info is incorrect.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A single Facebook post Friday drew vigorous response, following the national arc, from emotion to tempered discussion. Patrick Schuster of Garden Grove, Calif., criticized those for whom &quot;only 'whites' are capable of racism . . . 'non-whites,' by the very nature of skin tone, are incapable of hate crimes.. . . This is a base lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ted Klett of Hopewell felt &quot;the president took us to school cause we needed it.&quot; Klett wrote later that &quot;if we want less people to go to jail and not be hurt worse by retaliation, we should teach them to know the true difference between violence, force and self defense.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obama's remarks, and the media debate, sparked discussion in many households. Ellen Foos of Princeton said she used Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's fate as an example for her adopted son, Kayjuan, 13, who is African American and favors hoodies, &quot;of how he should be a bit more aware of his actions and behavior.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She saw the Lemon/Ferguson encounter, and read a widely viralized Facebook post on the Zimmerman verdict by Ahmir &quot;Questlove&quot; Thompson, drummer for the Philadelphia band the Roots. Kayjuan is not political, but he does think Obama &quot;is trying to improve race relations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not everyone is content with the media coverage. Chris Harper, professor of journalism at Temple University, says writers such as Charles Blow of the New York Times have sought a moderate tone. But coverage is still skewed, he says. The Rev. Al Sharpton's moderately attended rallies are covered as if &quot;the moratorium marches in Vietnam or the march on Washington with [the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.] had happened again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For his part, Lemon calls the media debate &quot;a good thing on the whole.&quot; Both he and Peterson see it, however, as unfinished business. (Peterson: &quot;We have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">so</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> much work to do yet in this nation.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Lemon's words: &quot;White people need to listen to black people when they share their truths, and not deny that it exists. It's insulting. And black people need to listen to white people about their fears and concerns without castigating them. In order to have a conversation both sides have to listen and not just talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DESPITE THE outrage sparked by George Zimmerman's acquittal in the Florida shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a local group said last night that it thinks race relations in the country are improving. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sentiment came out of a group discussion hosted in Brewerytown by the Father's Day Rally Committee on the controversial verdict, which reignited national debate about racial profiling and equal justice. The discussion included about 20 men, many of whom are in drug-recovery programs, and composed of a mix of races and ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The old traditional ways of how your family instilled in you, you can't be around this race or this race, society is starting to overlook that now and come more together,&quot; said Michael Thompson, 39, of West Philadelphia. &quot;Interracial relationships are more accepted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thompson, who is white, shared a story of taking a black female friend to a family gathering last Christmas and getting to meet her family separately. While they were apprehensive about how they would be received by the other's family, Thompson said both families handled it well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It went down good on both sides and my family still asks, 'Do you still see her?' &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite their optimism about race relations overall, many participants said they believe Martin was racially profiled and that race played a factor in the outcome, citing the five white women on the six-person jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It ain't like O.J. [Simpson] with the small gloves,&quot; said Victor Martinez, 36, of Grays Ferry. &quot;They got way more stuff they could have used [to prosecute the case].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some in the group referred to President Obama's comments last week when he talked about his own experiences of being stereotyped, citing that as a factor in Martin's death. Others suggested popular culture and the perception of hoodies played a role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bilal Qayyum, president of the committee, said he learned a lot from the dialogue and hopes to replicate it on a larger scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think it was a great discussion and more discussions like these need to happen across the city in different venues where you get white men and black men sitting down talking about race,&quot; he said. &quot;I think this is a great model to look at to continue the discussion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS A former Philadelphian, I wanted to respond to Stephanie Farr's excellent &quot;Where's the Fuss?&quot; cover story: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a black male raised in the unforgiving streets of North Philly (22nd and Lehigh), I couldn't agree more. Sadly, Trayvon Martin's death, and the upheaval that followed, culminating with the acquittal of George Zimmerman, will fade in time and we will continue to have the streets of Philly and other areas of the nation littered with bodies of young black (mostly) males. We will continue to have young black (mostly) male mug-shot pictures that could be tapes tried together into a quilt that would stretch from coast to coast. It's sickening, it's sad and I'm disgusted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, Zimmerman profiled Martin based on stereotypes . . . but they were stereotypes that we (young black males) consistently perpetuate. We're angry that Zimmerman &quot;stalked&quot; and confronted Martin based on his appearance; meanwhile, on the other side of town, three hooded black teenagers burglarized a home. It's tragic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are losing generations of future professionals to a conscious ignorance. These rallies are laughable because for all the posturing, protesting and tears that fall, inevitably another &quot;event&quot; will rise to national prominence and we get to do it all over again. I remember the Million Man March in D.C. and the change and greater awareness that it was supposed to help usher in. What has followed are a million more deaths, a million more incarcerations, a million more drop outs, a million more lost black boys who grow into lost black men that feed the cycle of a self-imposed genocide that should probably qualify us for protection via the Endangered Species Act. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pol for Polaneczky </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to applaud the column &quot;A Simple Email Helps Fill City-Services Gap,&quot; by Ronnie Polaneczky. In the 6th District, I implemented the Bad Neighbor Initiative to both educate our neighbors about blighted properties and to hold those property owners accountable for their mismanagement. Absentee landlords and abandoned properties erode the quality of life in our neighborhoods. Your column reinforced the belief that these remain citywide issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 6th District alone, we've identified more than 2,500 nuisance properties and subpoenaed select landlords to testify before City Council. In addition, we've identified more than $11 million in tax-delinquent rental properties in the 6th District alone - enough to hire more than 230 teachers or police officers if those monies were collected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philadelphia has often been called a &quot;city of neighborhoods.&quot; We can't expect those neighborhoods to flourish if they are full of blighted and ignored properties maintained by bad neighbors. I've worked hard to identify and fix these issues in my first term, but I can't do it alone - my office even released the City Hall app for residents to report similar issues. This column was a great reminder that there is more work to do. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE there have been so many rallies lately - for Trayvon Martin, for victims of urban violence. But there was a familiar attitude among those who stood vigil for a transgender woman allegedly butchered by a john in Strawberry Mansion:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The media ignore us, and when they don't, they disrespect and misrepresent us. Society views us as disposable, expendable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I didn't totally disagree. But, as I stood in the crowd listening to friends and advocates mourn Diamond Woods, I wondered: If we can't even manage to care about the deaths of people we should be able to relate to - children - what chance do people often viewed as spectacles and freaks have at getting our attention, let alone our sympathy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the transgender community that gathered Tuesday at LOVE Park, Diamond was a gregarious and generous friend who struggled with the same issues as many of them. They had come out on the other side. Diamond wasn't so lucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But - and forgive my bluntness - to most of the world, she was just some trick-turning, drug-taking tranny. It's cruel and heartless and speaks more to that ongoing conversation we need to have about whose lives we value and whose we don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's also just the latest battle in a war over respect and representation that many in the LGBT community have waged for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a gay man, I remember the media coverage of lesbian and gay and bisexual lives in the '70s, '80s and early '90s, when we too were devalued and viewed as less than human,&quot; said Chris Bartlett, executive director of the William Way LGBT Community Center on Spruce Street near 13th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That has changed - mostly, anyway. And Bartlett said it started with the media changing the way they spoke about gay, lesbian and bisexual people. And by moving away from just telling stories about them as victims of crimes to showing them as real people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six years before Diamond Woods was butchered and her body parts scattered in an empty North Philly lot, Aamina Morrison said she nearly died at the hands of the man charged with killing Diamond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hadn't seen that man in years,&quot; Morrison said of Charles &quot;Nolan&quot; Sargent. &quot;But as soon as I saw his picture and looked in his eyes . . . I knew. I knew that he did it, and I knew what he was capable of, and I knew that it was the same guy that I almost lost my life to about six or seven years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time, Morrison - co-director of TIP, the Trans-health Information Project - was doing what her friend Diamond and many other transgender women are forced to do: sell their bodies to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My story could have ended there,&quot; she said. &quot;But it didn't.&quot; And as I looked around that rally, I saw transgender men and women who are so much more than what we in the media have sometimes reduced them to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In May, Mayor Nutter signed a groundbreaking bill that strengthened the city's laws to provide equal treatment to everyone in Philadelphia regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As wonderful as that is, clearly there is more ground to break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police behavior in the 2002 death of transgender entertainer Nizah Morris in Center City still has not been resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Other transgender Philadelphians have been killed and their deaths unsolved, advocates say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt. John Stanford, a police spokesman, said the department is meeting with members of the LGBT community to help train officers in relating to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While those folks have some real concerns about how they are portrayed in the media, I also really hope they noticed how many reporters were at that rally, stumbling as many of us were to use the right pronouns, to show the proper respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the rally, a woman approached me and asked if I was &quot;there to repair the damage&quot; after many were unhappy at how Diamond was described by some news organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I told her that I actually hadn't written about Diamond yet. But, I warned, she should give it a minute, because I was sure I'd step in it somehow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes that happens when you break new ground. </SPAN></P>

I taught them about the principles that I had been taught were fundamental aspects of this country's founding. I taught that justice would eventually favor the people who stood on the promises of a nation founded on &quot;Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.&quot; I taught a pack of lies!  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin (a child) is buried beneath those lies. He was put there by the actions of George Zimmerman (an adult) playing &quot;cops and robbers.&quot; I taught that there are consequences for your actions. That particular lesson only applies to young black boys! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was told to stay in his vehicle. He was told not to pursue. Trayvon tried to defend himself against an unauthorized attack from Zimmerman. Trayvon is dead because Zimmerman didn't follow directions! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman gets to live out his days contemplating his actions. Trayvon won't get that chance! I apologize for teaching things that just aren't true for young black boys! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have calls for &quot;a conversation about race.&quot; I've grown tired of the conversation! Talk won't save the lives of the young boys who have targets on their backs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message has been sent! It's &quot;open season&quot; on black men! Shoot them if you can create the opportunity! The system will defend your right to shoot them through the heart! I hope Zimmerman lives long enough to experience the agony he has caused the Martins and this nation. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media vs. jury </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I watched closely the media's coverage of the George Zimmerman trial. I watched pundits nightly remind me that Trayvon Martin was a young &quot;black&quot; man and Zimmerman was a &quot;white&quot; man. For whatever reason, they wanted me to remember that more than anything else.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I did. I concluded that particular views of society's ills and the relative state of affairs of race in the U.S. were not the charge to this jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no redeeming rationale to regurgitating our grievances over matters that were of no concern to these six women. They had a specific role to play, limited to rendering a verdict consistent with the law. They performed that &quot;focused&quot; responsibility - to the letter of the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media wanted all past indiscretions addressed by this trial. These jurors could not possibly have been expected to fulfill their pledge to the court by considering anything other than the facts before them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, if a discussion needs to occur about flaws in the system, or about how some have a greater advantage and others lesser, let's have that discussion. But to include it in the happenings in Sanford, Fla., does a disservice to those who still respect this system and believe in its integrity. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was described as a beautiful boy with soulful brown eyes - moral, empathetic and gentle. Captain of the high school wrestling team and nominated to the National Honor Society, he was also a diligent student with high-achieving friends who knew they could call him at 2 a.m. if they needed a favor. &quot;Saving lives brings me joy,&quot; he once tweeted of why he became a lifeguard. But now Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sits accused of violently ending several lives, maiming others and inflicting terror with homemade bombs during the Boston Marathon on April 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far south of Boston, in Sanford, Fla., under different circumstances, a young man triggered unwarranted alarm in February 2012 merely for wearing a hoodie and walking in a gated community where an onlooker assumed he had no right to be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because George Zimmerman felt uncomfortable with the young man's appearance, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin ended up dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cases, both of which have triggered outrage, have one critical thing in common. Both show how lethally wrong we can be when we try to predict people's behavior according to the stories and stereotypes we've recorded in our heads about how they should or shouldn't look or act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I share the outrage over the fact that the killer of an unarmed black man doing nothing wrong got off without criminal sanction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the outrage over a Rolling Stone magazine cover photo said to glamorize Tsarnaev is misplaced. In running that rock star-like picture of an accused bomber, Rolling Stone was making precisely this point: Appearances can lie, and terrorists don't necessarily come packaged in long beards as recluses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can be the popular all-American athlete who smokes dope. They can embrace popular culture. They can even be hunks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on his appearance and what little people knew of him, &quot;terrorist&quot; would not have been an outcome predicted for Tsarnaev.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that the friends, teachers and other acquaintances lied. It's that they missed a side he worked to conceal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was, concluded the Rolling Stone article, a &quot;deeply fractured boy&quot; who didn't start out believing in radical rhetoric, but, &quot;As each small disappointment wore on his family, ultimately ripping them apart, it also furthered Jahar's (his nickname) own disintegration - a series of quiet yet powerful body punches. No one saw a thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had closer attention been paid to the subtler clues Tsarnaev gave out - his sudden embrace of Islam, his contention that 9/11 was &quot;an inside job&quot; and the fact that non-Muslim friends were rarely allowed into his family's apartment, people might have noticed the widening double life he led.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had they observed his gradual process of alienation, disconnectedness and anger, they might have worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who study terrorists say this is how it most often happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than say, 'I'm lost, I've got a problem,' it's much easier to find a convenient enemy or scapegoat,&quot; Rolling Stone quotes Tom Neer, a retired FBI agent and now counterterrorism adviser, as saying. &quot;The justification comes later - say, U.S. imperialism or whatever. It's the explanation that is key.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's important, says Neer, &quot;is looking past their exterior and getting access to that interior.&quot; Who's to say if closer attention to Tsarnaev might have saved the Boston Marathon victims?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our justice system isn't supposed to throw people in jail on mere suspicions. But if those close to him had been attuned and concerned enough about his anger and angst to try and get him help, they might inadvertently have prevented the horrible upshot. Instead, they deferred to outside appearances: The guy was chill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is absolutely clear is that had George Zimmerman not jumped to conclusions about a black kid wearing a hoodie, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin would still be alive. If there is a lesson to be learned from both tragedies - one of missed clues, the other of overreaction - it's that both kinds of presumptions, about who looks like one of the guys and who doesn't, can be fatally flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profiling leaves innocent people dead. It lets us ignore warning signs of explosive rage brewing in someone close to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It even, as we have learned, failed to predict a future president. We must stop relying on it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The astounding reach of Beyonce's cultural impact is illustrated by a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; bit where first lady wanna-be Ann Romney (played by Kate McKinnon), blurts that she'd kill her equestrian-competition horse to meet Beyonce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't have pictured you as a Beyonce fan,&quot; says &quot;Weekend Update&quot; host Seth Myers. &quot;Everyone is a Beyonce fan, Seth,&quot; retorts an adamant Ann. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Elvis Presley, the Beatles, and Madonna before her, Beyonce is more than the sum of her songs (or her 17 Grammys). A true global icon, she represents many different things to a broad swath of people, particularly women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She comes across as a woman who's living her life on her own terms and realizing her full potential,&quot; says Cathy McClelland, who's in charge of her own entrepreneurial training and business development service in Southfield, Mich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At age 31, Beyonce has become a prism for society's defining discussions. When she's not rocking the Super Bowl or shopping at Target (she was spotted at a Houston location last week), she remains a figure in commercialism, politics, privacy issues and female empowerment. Here's a closer look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce the marketer. Beyond being one the most successful recording artists of the new millennium, Beyonce has demonstrated enormous clout as a pitchwoman for American Express, L'Oreal and Pepsi, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrities with such wide appeal are rare and sought after by all sorts of corporations. &quot;You become the go-to person for everything from aspirins to zebras,&quot; according to Michael Bernacchi, a University of Detroit Mercy marketing professor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she drew criticism recently from health advocates for supporting Michelle Obama's fitness campaign while signing a $50-million deal with soft drink maker Pepsi, she didn't flinch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pepsi is a brand I've grown up seeing my heroes collaborate with,&quot; she said. &quot;The company respects musicians and artistry. I wouldn't encourage any person, especially a child, to live life without balance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides pushing products for others, Beyonce has launched her own perfume lines and fashion label. She is the perfect entrepreneurial role model, says Ms. McClelland, who has launched the Propel Project, an initiative to help women entrepreneurs that's a spin-off of the 2012 Urban Rebound Detroit Pitch Competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tell all entrepreneurs, look for every single opportunity, and she does that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce the social force. When she made Time's 100 Most Influential People list, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; director Baz Luhrmann wrote, &quot;Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA - the reigning national voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The singer-songwriter, a friend and supporter of President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, has played a public role at both of Mr. Obama's inaugurations. And when Beyonce and her husband, Jay-Z, traveled to Cuba this year, there was a brouhaha among some congressional figures about their trip to a country that's under embargo for ordinary visits by Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the entertainer doesn't let academics or politicians define her. She speaks loudest through her philanthropy, which includes helping survivors of disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake and being an ambassador for 2012's World Humanitarian Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when she does raise her voice, it's newsworthy. Over the weekend, she called for a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin at her Nashville concert, which started not long after word spread of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the death of the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce the image controller. As someone who lives under the microscope of celebrity, Beyonce is adamant about being in control of her image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, she debuted the HBO documentary about her life, &quot;Beyonce: Life Is But a Dream,&quot; a candid portrait of herself on and off the stage, but one that she codirected and was able to scrutinize before it aired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent GQ story described in detail the archive that Beyonce has created: &quot;a temperature-controlled digital-storage facility that contains virtually every existing photograph of her, starting with the very first frames taken of Destiny's Child, the '90s girl group she once fronted; every interview she has ever done; every video of every show she has ever performed; every diary entry she has ever recorded while looking into the unblinking eye of her laptop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a remarkable effort from someone determined to be the architect of her professional roles and handle the necessary promotion and public appearances on her own terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always have gotten the impression that she determines the outcome. It's different from somebody who's told what do to and follows the template. She's made the mold of her template,&quot; says Mr. Bernacchi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce the female empowerment figure. In an interview with UK Vogue, Beyonce said she considers herself &quot;a modern-day feminist,&quot; a description other female pop idols have declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beyonce is part of the 'I'll do it my way' innovators generation. They are so different. They're not afraid of the word 'feminist,'&quot; says Anne Doyle, leadership strategist and author of &quot;Powering Up! How America's Women Achievers Become Leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Doyle sees Beyonce as epitomizing the comfort level and confidence of the generation of young women just hitting 30 and younger. &quot;She's really on the leading edge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonce created her Sasha Fierce character as an alter ego of assertiveness and put together her all-female band, the Sugar Mamas, who are another symbol of the girl power of her lyrics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, Beyonce performed in London at a concert for Chime for Change, a campaign set up to help empower girls and women around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, she is all about an empowered woman, and not just about her. She's very willing to use her power to lift girls and women,&quot; Ms. Doyle says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pg. A-10</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama stirred hearts with a noble song. Several days after the jury reached its verdict, he addressed the trial of George Zimmerman and the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. The words that received the most attention were not his most important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said that 35 years ago he could have been Martin. The statement seemed to annoy whites who lack the gift of empathy or even the inclination to practice it. Humans generally do not try to see things from another's perspective. Obama and other African-Americans have been accused of not addressing problems within the black community. The allegation is not true. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's comments about the Zimmerman trial included the following: &quot;(T)his isn't to say that the African-American community is na&iuml;ve about the fact that African-American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system,&quot; and &quot;someone like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than by someone else.&quot; And he said in phrases that ought to appeal to conservatives as well as to liberals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been a lot of talk about, 'Should we convene a conversation on race?' I haven't seen that to be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations. They end up being stilted and politicized, and folks are locked into the positions they already have. On the other hand, in families and churches and workplaces, there's the possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you can ask yourself your own questions about, 'Am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can? Am I judging people as much as I can based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character?' That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks echoed his May 19 commencement address at Atlanta's Morehouse College, when he said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves. We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices. And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself. Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is there's no longer any room for excuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand there's a common fraternity creed here at Morehouse: 'Excuses are tools of the incompetent used to build bridges to nowhere and monuments of nothingness.'  Well, we've got no time for excuses.  Not because the bitter legacies of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they have not. Not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; we know those are still out there.  It's just that in today's hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with millions of young people from China and India and Brazil -- many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did -- all of them entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And, moreover, you have to remember that whatever you've gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured -- and they overcame them. And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama spoke about the Martin tragedy and to the Morehouse graduates grace flowed from his lips.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are those who refuse to accept the injustice in the Trayvon murder trial. It annoys them. They swat away at their subconscious like a fly buzzing about their person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the fly, they want questions to go away. Deep inside where they think private thoughts they know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of us have preconceived perceptions. I used to picture a gay man as weak. With the coming out of several gay sports superstars, I now know this is wrong. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I remember the icon of the Mexican lazily sleeping under the palm tree with his sombrero and wide brim hat. If you have ever lugged a 50-pound sack of oranges around all day to make minimum wage for your family, you know that image is false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the Poles are stupid or the Irish are drunks is as wrong as the notion that our laws are equally applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a family member who has been stopped twice in the state of Arizona. He is a Mexican-American. There was no citation, no question, no other reason for the stop. His response was, &quot;They're only doing their job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My family member's ignorance of the Constitution notwithstanding, these incidents highlight the core of the belief of conservative, white Americans. You must look, act and support their view of America or you are not American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have another family member who is married to an openly racist white person. My relative is in complete acceptance of those views, and that is the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For far too long, white progressives, minorities, gays, women and those who worship a different God have tried to blend into the conservative's color of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the other fly that buzzes around the dung-pile verdict of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Felix Sepulveda, San Bernardino</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FDA ignored its findings and approved drug</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FDA ignored its own conclusions regarding Avandia and instead opted for a Risk Evaluation and Management Study. Thus Avandia, which is used to treat Type 2 diabetes, can be given now to patients who the FDA believes would benefit from the drug outweighing the risks they themselves determined. This is a ridiculous assumption made by non-medical people. There are so many non-lethal drugs that can be given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since President George W. Bush politicized the FDA in 2002, this agency under the president's cabinet has done nothing to regulate the drug industry, completely ignoring their sworn duty to protect the public. They are co-opted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FDA has not removed Vioxx from the market. Its maker, Merck Laboratories, took it off facing thousands of lawsuits from the families of the 80,000 victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merck and the FDA both knew of the 340 percent increase in deaths of arthritic patients who were prescribed Vioxx before it was put on the market. Merck could possibly make and sell Vioxx again. The FDA has nothing against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now they refuse to take Avandia, another diabetes drug, off the market. Don't take Avandia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los Angeles News Group</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">598 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many more Detroits are there in America?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit -- there are 100 more cities like it. Here's how they get there. Unions charge members fees. The money goes to politicians who make a prior commitment to pass the legislation to satisfy union demands in salary, retirement benefits and health care. They know these agreements cannot withstand the length of the agreement but politicians will be retired with their own plush plan by then anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Detroit reaches the point of $1 billion in income vs. $18 billion din debt, due to this irrational spending, bankruptcy occurs. The unions are even suing now saying the city cannot declare bankruptcy even though there are not anywhere near the funds available to solve the problem. This is what happens when Democratic politicians huddle with greedy union bosses and have no idea of future problems, or don't care. Don't include Republicans in this fiasco as there has not been a Republican in Detroit policy positions since the ice box was the top-selling kitchen appliance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guess who will be looking at bankruptcy next? According to economists, there are over 100 cities in the country that are almost at the stage Detroit is in. Several are in California, such as San Diego. A handful have already filed. Others are on standby! We will be asked to cover the cost of the bailout of these cities through higher taxes. Detroit is asking for a federal bailout which means Californians will be paying for the funds to bring Detroit back among the living. In short, the country is in a mess and President Obama is out announcing a new economic program for the country. It sounds a lot like the current misguided effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Jim Remington, La Habra Heights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many states actually allow you to stand your ground</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You assert in your editorial of July 17 that George Zimmerman's claim of self-defense in the shooting death of Travon Martin was effective because of Florida's stand-your-ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His attorneys did not invoke that law in their successful defense. Zimmerman's self-defense claim rested upon Martin breaking Zimmerman's nose, bashing his head into the concrete and reaching for Zimmerman's gun, which would be sufficient to make out a case for self-defense not just in Florida but in any state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 15, KPCC's Larry Mantle discussed the Zimmerman case with several experts. Among them was attorney Andrew Branca, a national authority on the law of self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Branca said, &quot;I hear a lot of discussion about how Florida has this crazy stand-your-ground law that creates these unique legal scenarios. The fact is Florida's stand-your-ground law is quite common; 33 states are effectively SYG states and have very similar provisions. In fact there is one state that not only lets you to stand your ground, it explicitly allows you to pursue your assailant if necessary for your safety. And that state is California.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You wrote that Zimmerman is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They New York Times says he is a white Hispanic and the L.A. paper says he identifies as Latino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is a Latino who was raised in a multi-racial household and lived in a multi-racial neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After interviewing nearly three dozen people in their investigation of the Zimmerman murder case, the FBI found no evidence that racial bias was a motivating factor in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, records released July 11 show.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two years out of the University of Southern California's film school, Ryan Coogler is still paying down his debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may not be the case for long. Coogler's first feature film, &quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; goes into wide U.S. release this weekend, having earned universal acclaim from critics, awards at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals and some early Oscar buzz. Coogler, 27, wrote the script and directed the independent drama, while Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker produces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add to that auspicious start a timely release. The real-life story of Oscar Grant, a young black man shot to death by a white transit policeman, hits theaters in the midst of a heated debate about race after the acquittal of a white and Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer for the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing is just a coincidence, Coogler says, but he believes what happened to 22-year-old Grant at the Fruitvale commuter rail station in Oakland, California, on New Year's Day 2009 still resonates today, in part because of gun violence involving African-American men, as both victims and perpetrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler, also an African-American from Oakland, was 22 when an unarmed Grant, lying on his stomach, was shot to death on a train platform after transit police detained him following a fight on a train. Coogler knew it was a story he wanted to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I learned at film school that, because it is such a difficult process, to always make stuff that really matters to me, to make films like they are the last film you will ever make,&quot; Coogler told Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he learned to choose subject matter that is &quot;not only close to you and impacts you emotionally but subject matter that you are curious about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film opens with the actual mobile phone video of the incident and the chilling pop of the fatal gunshot. It then jumps back to chronicle Grant's final day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael B. Jordan, of TV show &quot;Friday Night Lights,&quot; plays Grant, a loving father and struggling ex-con. Octavia Spencer, an Oscar winner for her role in &quot;The Help,&quot; plays the mother who fears for his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other big takeaway for Coogler at film school was that filmmaking is a team sport, much like the football he loved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I came to film school in L.A., I had just finished playing my last season of college football, and I missed it, deeply,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his incoming class, he found a group of filmmakers from all over the world with whom he began &quot;crewing up and working on each other's films.&quot; He brought a half dozen of them aboard for &quot;Fruitvale Station.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'A STANDOUT FROM DAY ONE'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler calls the three-year graduate program at USC's School of Cinematic Arts &quot;really expensive.&quot; Tuition for three years runs between $72,000 and $85,000 plus additional supplies and living expenses, the school says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am still pretty heavy in debt,&quot; he said. &quot;Most of us who graduate have something like a mortgage to pay back. It can be close to six figures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler did earn some scholarships while there, including the coveted Jack Nicholson award. &quot;Coog,&quot; as he is known there, caught the faculty's eye early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was clearly just a standout from day one,&quot; said John Watson, who had Coogler in his production class for two years. &quot;It wasn't just his abilities, which are fantastic. It was his attitude. He had the ability to make everybody feel like he's their best friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his second year, Coogler's short film &quot;Locks&quot; was accepted into the Cannes Film Festival and he didn't have the means to go. The school mobilized to collect travel money and the dean paid for his flight, Watson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While making &quot;Fruitvale&quot; after he graduated he kept in close touch with the school and even asked 10 faculty members to assemble to critique a near final cut. His success has played a part in inspiring other students to make films this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody, including me or him, thought that it would happen as fast as it did,&quot; Watson said. &quot;But as soon as I saw the first draft of 'Fruitvale' I knew he had something special and that Forest immediately responded to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coogler has been crisscrossing the country, promoting the film with distributor The Weinstein Company and working on his next film projects, one of which is about high school football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he doesn't think about Oscar nominations, even after favorable reviews across-the-board from the likes of the New York Times, the New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, whose film critic Kenneth Turan said it was &quot;more than a remarkable directing debut ... it's an outstanding film by any standard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am always the most surprised person, because the film came so close to not even being made, like so many independent films,&quot; Coogler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His reward, he said, is the opportunity to tell people what happened on an Oakland train platform four years ago and give them the perspective that comes from &quot;spending time with a character like Oscar.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Rogers' article (Page 1A, July 21) on the proliferation of California gulls in the Bay Area citing both danger to planes and smaller endangered birds reminded me of Alcatraz's (listed as a breeding site) protection policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former resident (my father was an officer) I attend National Park Service functions on Alcatraz several times a year. I noted they close off public access to the eastern portion of the island twice a year. When I asked an NPS ranger why, he replied it is due to the gulls nesting: &quot;They are a protected species.&quot; The island is filthy with droppings and feathers both on the ground and accumulating at the bottom of burnt-out buildings. My group, the Alcatraz Alumni Association, was exploring rebuilding the burnt-out, roofless old social hall. An architect, a former resident, drew up plans. He noted the deterioration of the buildings walls was due more to gull urine than salt air. That says a lot and one wonders about the long-term health of the NPS employees and volunteers, many who have been there for decades. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I subscribe to starting somewhere (breaking eggs plus not sealing off nesting areas) while other options are explored.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who grew up in Willow Glen, I'd like to add my voice to the many who oppose the San Jose City Council-approved demolition of the Willow Glen trestle. Structures such as the Willow Glen trestle are important links to the area's past, and once the trestle is gone, it can't be replaced. Shame on our elected officials for making a foolish decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mercury News showed two political cartoons Sunday that condemned the Republican Party for trying to destroy Obamacare. I will assume the cartoonists are not hard-core Obama supporters but, rather, they are unaware of what's happening with Obamacare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may want to read the latest news that some unions, long staunch Obamacare proponents, are warning Obamacare will shatter hard-won medical benefits and encourages employers to reduce workweeks to below 30 hours in order to avoid onerous and costly mandates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They should read that the White House, not the GOP, seeks a one-year delay in implementing the employer mandate because of the complexity inherent in a 2,000-page bill supported with more than 15,000 pages of regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suggest they read the Pacific Research Institute analysis of Obamacare, &quot;Myths and Realities of Obamacare.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Always being armed an outdated notion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NRA apologist offered the dubious idea that we citizens have to be armed (with either guns or sabers) wherever we go (&quot;Zimmerman case is no argument against guns,&quot; Letters, July 23). Either way, the writer holds out no hope for future Trayvon&nbsp;Martins; he had to be either shot or stabbed. This 19th century attitude is what's getting Americans killed. &quot;Stand your ground&quot; laws and other such absurdities facilitate these wanton killings. The fact that such views are still being promoted shows just how far we yet have to go in ridding our society of the utter nonsense that citizens have to be armed at all times.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Stand your ground' laws should be repealed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It upsets me how very little is being done to repeal or even review the &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in Florida and other states. Disturbing cases are surfacing of innocent young minorities being murdered with no consequence for the perpetrator -- all because of this law, which allows individuals to use firearms when they &quot;perceive a threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examples of this are the murders of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and Jordan Davis. Both unarmed black teenagers, both shot down by armed men. The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law encourages trigger-happy behavior among gun-carrying citizens -- and with an already alarming death toll on society's hands, it should be repealed immediately.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope President Barack Obama does not once again kowtow to the energy industry and its sycophants in Congress by approving the Keystone XL pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keystone would emit at least 181 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent 38 million cars. The State Department estimates greenhouse gas emissions from tar sands may be exceed emissions from average crude oil refined in the U.S. by 22 percent. Our addiction to oil, requiring new pipelines, will keep America from leading in the new energy world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Canadian oil industry's goal of producing 6 million barrels of destructive tar sands oil per day by 2030 could destroy chances of limiting the increase in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, the limit recommended by scientists to avoid dangerous climate disruptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keystone will move tar sands through America, not to America. It's an export pipeline that will increase gas prices. The State Department admits this pipeline will create very few permanent jobs, while contributing to climate-related disasters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the modern age of iPhones, iPads, iPods, Kindles, the Internet and countless movies and television channels, it is no wonder Americans have trouble sleeping. In fact, a study done in 2011 by the National Sleep Foundation reported about 63 percent of Americans stated that they do not sleep as well as they would like. So what can we do? Loyola University Health System in Chicago offers tips for a better night's rest, including starting to relax at least 60 minutes before bedtime, avoiding exercise or vigorous housework 60 minutes before bedtime and turning off all electronic devices (sleepfoundation.org). It also recommends darkening the room, not eating or drinking several hours before bedtime and making a next day to-do list to decrease anxiety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consistently sleeping well has numerous health benefits, such as maintaining a healthy heart, has the potential to reduce the risk of cancer, reduces stress and inflammation, boosts memory and can aid in weight loss (www.longevity.about.com). So, America, go to sleep! </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last couple of weeks the news on television and in the newspaper has been the planning of apartments/condos to be built in Mishawaka and South Bend. The developers have told us about all of the amenities and the view of the St. Joseph River from them. Prices range up to a half million dollars, but what they did not tell the future buyers is that every day and night at no extra cost to them, they will have to put up with the loud speakers from cars driving by their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If they're smart and wait awhile, I'm sure some developer will build these units in Elkhart where they do not tolerate that kind of noise pollution. There, the drivers pay the cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even better, Mishawaka/South Bend could get on the money wagon with Elkhart and start cracking down on these drivers and give us all back the peace and quiet we all deserve.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, I have seen no major news stories regarding the topic of Christians under attack; Coptic Christians are under attack in Egypt also, but there is no mention of that scandal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I work for Prime Development Realty, the developer of the &quot;other&quot; town homes, the Townes at Kamm Island. They are the colorful units on the south side of the river toward 100 Center and 13 of the 15 units have sold and they continue to sell if they come back on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economy dealt us all a blow, but things are turning around. The three-story commercial building by Beutter Park now has the second and third floors occupied. The Center for Hospice is nearing completion, with the addition of 90 or so jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I've met families from Goshen, Plymouth and Granger who come down to use the 3.5 miles of river-walk and the parks on weekends. The downtown has seen new growth, too, with several new restaurants and shops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My problem with this tragedy is all of the biased media and hate mongers who either didn't pay attention to the facts and evidence in the trial or simply know nothing about it and are using it to stir up more unrest in this country. The political nuances are also disgusting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When infants in Chicago are shot and killed by random gang violence, we don't hear the outrage that we should because it is black on black. Zimmerman isn't even white; he's Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no evidence that Zimmerman had ill will or any feeling of animosity toward Martin. He was doing what a neighborhood watch person does. There had been several break-ins in the neighborhood. It was a dark, rainy night and he was concerned about someone that he didn't recognize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin could have run. He chose to stay and challenge Zimmerman. I sincerely believe that the shooting was an accident and Zimmerman panicked as he was getting his head pummeled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was glad to be a part of the peaceful &quot;Cry for Justice&quot; rally on Saturday. It was great that so many people came out to show their support for justice and equality. We prayed, we sang spirituals, and we cried to God for help in uniting our communities and ending the violence that threatens to tear us apart. After leaving such a peaceful event, I was disappointed when I turned on Facebook and read comments others left about this event. I was discouraged to see so much misunderstanding about the purpose of the rally and even outright anger at those who attended. The purpose of the rally was simply to show solidarity with those who believe in treating all people equally and fairly. During the rally we prayed and mourned not only for Trayvon Martin, but for all victims of gun violence, including the gang violence that plagues places such as Chicago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The George Zimmerman case is over and we don't fault the jurors. The law required a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict if there was any sliver of doubt and we understand that. The fault is not with the jurors or with the outcome of the trial, but with laws that encourage people to take justice into their own hands. Although Stand Your Ground laws were not used in this case, the existence of those laws encourages people to use guns first and ask questions later. So one purpose of the rally was to speak out publicly against the Stand Your Ground laws that exist in many states, including Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more importantly, I joined with my neighbors and friends at this rally to take a stand against racial inequality and the racial profiling which still sadly goes on in our own backyard. It's a sad reality that some people who see a black teenager walking through their neighborhood in the rain automatically think he's &quot;suspicious&quot; and should be followed, but those same people when they see a white teenager walking through the rain just think &quot;he's lost&quot; and offer him a ride home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even though Zimmerman is Hispanic, he had a history of making many calls to the police and the log of those calls shows that he overwhelmingly called when he saw black males walking through his neighborhood. So there is a question as to whether or not Zimmerman profiled Martin based on his skin color, and some of us do think the U.S. Department of Justice is obligated to at least examine whether or not racial profiling was used in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, whether Zimmerman is brought up on new charges or not is almost irrelevant. The point is that all of us - regardless of our race, ethnicity or religion - have a need to come together and say that we know the world isn't fair, but that we want to work toward making it more fair. This rally gave people an opportunity to stand together and say that Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream is still alive and we as a community can work together to make it a  reality. As King himself said, &quot;Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's dark. His heart is racing, and with each beat the fluid of life spurts out his heart and lungs like a squirt gun. His breathing draws heavy. He's scared. No one really knows what the final moments of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life were like, but according to most medical experts, Trayvon survived for a couple of minutes and probably was semiconscious. Even after his heart finally gave out, his brain retained roughly 16 seconds of oxygen, enough to keep it functional, enough for a moment of contemplation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we do know is Trayvon was unarmed, had committed no crime, and his race initiated the chain of events that led to his loss of life. The same was true for 13-year-old Darius Simmons of Milwaukee, an African-American youth. He was simply moving a garbage can in front of his home when his 75-year-old white neighbor confronted him with a shotgun and accused him of stealing from his home. The neighbor shot Darius in his chest while he had his hands raised; his mom was watching in horror. It was later determined that Darius was in school at the time of the theft. Darius Simmons was unarmed and had committed no crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same was also true for 13-year-old Jarrell Tucker of Indianapolis. This African-American youth was walking down the street, confronted by a 56-year-old white man, punched and shot two times, once in the head and once in the leg. Detectives talked to the shooter but did not detain him. After talking to witnesses, police subsequently issued a warrant for the arrest of the shooter. Jarrell Tucker was unarmed and had committed no crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And let's not forget 17-year-old Jordan Davis, an African-American youth of Jacksonville, Fla. A 45-year-old white man claimed he felt threatened by teenagers playing loud music. He fired eight or nine times into an SUV, killing the teen. Like the others, Jordan Davis was unarmed and had committed no crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot ignore that the significant increase in drug-related violence and homicides in the urban communities has imbedded in the minds of both blacks and whites that young black men are criminal predators. This profile was the predominate factor in all these cases, including Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Take into consideration that African-Americans are significantly more likely to be profiled, arrested and incarcerated than white suspects who commit similar offenses and have equal to longer criminal records. Include that African-Americans are approximately six times more likely to spend time in prison or jail than whites. Add in that African-Americans receive up to 60 percent longer federal prison sentences than whites who commit similar offenses, and 20 percent longer prison sentences than whites who commit the same offenses. And overlay those facts with a justice system in which African-American defendants are consistently overcharged by prosecutors in contrast to white defendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus it is reasonable to understand the anger and mistrust African-Americans have for the justice system. The stereotyping of young black men as criminal predators is not new. During reconstruction in 1915, &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; led the way in the stereotyping of young black men as savages. In this film, the terrifying, savage African-American was tamed through lynching; today it's with a gun. This criminal predator stereotyping continues and is commonly used as a backdrop to justify concealed weapons and &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far back as the emancipation, and over the years, the image of the savage from the &quot;Dark Continent&quot; periodically is revitalized stealthily within social policy agendas. And racial violence against African-Americans throughout U.S. history was justified and encouraged. The message of the day to whites was, in order to protect our way of life we must put blacks in their place; and that is exactly what George Zimmerman insisted on doing to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who was unarmed and had committed no crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obamacare was a disaster from the start</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial staff at the Post-Dispatch has always been irony-impaired. Your editorial &quot;Last gasp&quot; (July 21) confirms that and completely gives up the game for Obamacare proponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim that &quot;Obamacare might actually work&quot; is belied by the actual facts. The statement that rates have fallen in some states is not at all supported by what has actually happened. The studies that claim to show that do not compare like policies and even worse, relative to the types of policies actually purchased in the individual markets, rates are several times more expensive. Obamacare has the effect of telling people that they can't actually keep the plan they have. Instead, they have to buy plans that are much more costly. You see, those rubes just did not know enough to buy the plans that the federal government deems appropriate for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one state where Obamacare had minimal impact is in New York. That is because government interference, in this case from the state, many years ago already had the effect of driving rates up to unsustainable levels and reducing the individual market by some 90 percent. The situation was so bad there that Obamacare did make it somewhat better. So now, we are going to have New York writ large across the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most obvious contradiction however comes in your last paragraph. There you admit that the economics of Obamacare cannot work. &quot;Inevitably, economics will force it to give way to a single-payer national health care system.&quot; Well of course, that is what the proponents wanted all along. Since the design is such a train wreck, it is predestined to fail. My concern is that the wrong people will be blamed. Instead of the proponents of Obamacare, the unions, the left-wing special interests and the politicians who owe their sinecures to those special interests, somehow insurers, hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies will take the blame. You mention the nasty Republicans, and I'm sure they'll take their share of the blame too because they knew it was a disaster from the start. At least we know the game plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Kirschbaum o Chesterfield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applaud those students, families who pursue an excellent education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter from Joseph Carroll (&quot;Editorials on school transfers distort racial issues,&quot; July 20) makes me ashamed to be a resident of St. Louis. I attribute my feelings of shame to characteristics of my race - the human race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Carroll sites what he calls &quot;characteristics of blacks.&quot; I wonder if he would feel equally comfortable citing that Hispanics are predisposed to become gardeners, Irish to drink, Germans to love military marches and swastikas, and Italians to form family-based crime syndicates. His arguments and statements are fallacious and not supported by facts or educational material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Mr. Carroll doesn't seem to take into account is the impact environment has on those that are forced to inhabit that community. Poor socioeconomic conditions certainly contribute mightily to all of the negative and destructive behaviors he mentions. These behaviors could occur whether the neighborhood was black or white, and any impartial study will support that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I applaud any citizen's right to speak and am certainly sympathetic to the questions, fears, apprehensions and misinformation that parents, teachers, students and officials face in this situation, it is only by coming together with an open dialogue and respect that this situation can be successfully navigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the great leveler: an excellent education. Educational opportunities can allow for the freedom to rise above any circumstances, to soar to heights commanded by hard work, dedication and the love of learning. Too long have we created and fostered an unequal class system by offering education equal in value to the economic wealth of a community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, I would applaud any family and participant in the educational process willing to question and listen with an open mind - not one blinded by debunked and vicious stereotypes. I would applaud any student who is willing to be bused 20-30 miles and enter a different environment, because they so value education. I would applaud those willing to work together because they, too, recognize the value of an excellent education and the opportunities it offers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maureen Redig o Olivette</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun industry benefits from shoot-first message</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media have shown us just how possible it is to gun down, with impunity and without a shred of remorse, someone who you merely suspect intends to commit a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What message does this escape hatch for felons send? It depends on the receiver. For a young black male, the message might be &quot;carry a gun, shoot first and plead self-defense.&quot; For the firearms industry, the obvious message is &quot;keep on doing what you've been doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this isn't the best of all possible worlds for the gun industry, it has to be close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin F. Frick o Warrenton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Society is safer with concealed carry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Kathleen Parker's column &quot;The road to bedlam&quot; (July 17):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About halfway through the piece, she makes the statement &quot;It seems impossible that someone's young son, guilty of nothing, should die.&quot; Trayvon Martin was guilty of nothing up to the point that he struck George Zimmerman, apparently breaking his nose, and then was on top of him striking him further and banging his head on the concrete. In any jurisdiction this is assault, and had Mr. Martin prevailed he likely would have been certified to stand trial as an adult for this violent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, at the end of the article the statement is made &quot;What was George Zimmerman doing walking around his neighborhood armed and loaded? In what world is this normal behavior?&quot; Mr. Zimmerman was walking around his neighborhood because of a crime problem. He was legally armed because he had a concealed carry permit. This is normal behavior in 49 states, soon to be 50 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider that the Government Accountability Office, in a study last year, estimated that approximately 8 million U.S. citizens have active concealed carry permits. These people are predominantly law-abiding citizens. The American Journal of Public Health published a study in the January issue that concluded in part &quot;CHL holders were much less likely than nonlicensees to be convicted of crimes.&quot; This was based on studying crimes in Texas from 2001-2009 committed by license holders and non-license holders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI has also published statistics that the crime rate has dropped dramatically over the last 10 years, while the number of concealed carry permit holders has gone up. There are undoubtedly other factors involved, but there is evidence our society is safer with law-abiding citizens responsibly armed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Physicians' assistants without a physician?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding &quot;New Missouri law aims to ease doctor shortage&quot; (July 14):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the cost and availability of primary medical care is such that physicians' assistants will be allowed to treat patients when they are not working under the direct supervision of a physician, will not their job title have to be revised?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RACIAL ISSUES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a long history to break away from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Bell's July 23 commentary (&quot;Blacks must also look inward, at our culture&quot;), about Trayvon Martin's death and the black community, was very interesting. As only an African-American can describe, Bell told about his culture's low self-respect and dysfunctional behavior, which led to the &quot;epidemic of black-on-black murders.&quot; Few can disagree on this point. It is sad that the &quot;majority of African-Americans ... reject this new culture in silence,&quot; and I commend Bell for speaking out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Bell left out though, is why he still sides with a conservative party that enables this behavior by promoting policies and laws that continue to oppress African-Americans. The list is long and hurts all minorities and economic groups through the middle class. It includes proliferating handguns, &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, bad self-defense laws (like Florida's), banking policies, real-estate redlining of neighborhoods, union busting, shipping jobs from America, poor minimum-wage laws, drug laws and other aspects of the justice system that racially profile, and much more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, one more thing. It would have been good if Bell had delivered his story in the context of our country's historical treatment of African-Americans, from slavery through reconstruction, industrialization, and the present low-paying service industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GARY THOMPSON, St. Paul</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's commentary was a welcome opening in our stale old dialogue about race. Whites, not just blacks, must look inward. The problem lies in our dominant narratives about race, which hold that blacks are in one way or another victims, usually of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The white narrative essentially says that blacks are mere victims of racism, or public institutions. White liberals and often blacks blame &quot;other&quot; people's racism. White conservatives blame liberal establishments such as the public schools and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the government for black poverty and problems. Almost everybody denies personal responsibility for it all. Liberal or conservative or black, the predominant narrative is that blacks are powerless victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism certainly exists and can make things more difficult, just as my epilepsy exists and can make my life more difficult. But if, when I developed this condition, I had believed I was a victim, I wouldn't have been able to carry on with life, develop a career, eventually get married, raise children, be active in my community and more. The more we believe in victimhood, the less we can go anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must transform this narrative of victimhood about race. Everybody has amazing power if they only know it, and we must pay attention to what is possible, look for the best in people, and not give up on each other and what we can all accomplish together.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, above the fold on the front page - below the masthead and just below the entirely justifiable mention of the two 2013 Pulitzers - the Star Tribune had to run a story about the royal baby. On Wednesday, it was a midpage photo of the happy, dimwitted Windsors. Really? Please get back to giving your readers more of that Pulitzer-winning content.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vital to baseball teams and their communities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer of the July 23 Letter of the Day, critical of Target and the Chicago Cubs for desecrating the hallowed ivy walls of Wrigley Field with advertising, would benefit from some basic examples of economics and history. The economics of professional sports necessitate the utilization of every possible revenue stream to remain competitive, while the history of baseball reveals that advertising has always been a major source of every team's income. In fact, advertising covered Wrigley's outfield walls from baseline to baseline for more than 20 years before the ivy was planted, and Fenway Park's famous &quot;Green Monster&quot; was obscured by ads for more than 30 years before being painted green in 1947. Both modifications were likely in response to player complaints about the difficulty of seeing the baseball in a collage of billboards, rather than fan disgust with corporate greed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAN EITTREIM, Minneapolis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; &middot; &middot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who complain about logo placement or naming rights by corporations must try to understand the importance of corporate support for arts and culture projects, entertainment venues and sports facilities. Ironically, the very stadium the letter writer reveres was named for its owner, the chewing-gum magnate William Wrigley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without the support of corporations like Target (and Wrigley), millions of people would be denied access to programs and facilities. As the president of an organization that began with generous funding from the Dayton Hudson Foundation, we continue to receive support from Target for one of our 33 projects - the Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Twin Cities area has a rich legacy of philanthropic support that has made this one of the best places in the country to live and work. But over the years, as the family-owned companies headquartered here have transitioned out of these families, corporations like Target have stepped in to fill the funding gap. We've benefited tremendously as a city and region from their largesse. In fact, the Chronicle of Philanthropy just named Target one of the top 10 most generous companies in the nation, donating approximately $224 million in cash and products in the last year.</SPAN></P>

In the shopping mall they follow me. ... Black male: Guilty until proven innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have lost control of my emotions,&quot; he declared. &quot;Rage, Frustration, Anguish, Despondency, Fatigue, Bitterness, Animosity, Exasperation, Sadness. Emotions once suppressed, emotions once channeled, now are let loose. Why?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The words came not in response to the George Zimmerman verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing but rather to the acquittal of the police officers in the Rodney King case. The author of the May 6, 1992, column in the Stanford University student newspaper: Cory Booker, now the nationally celebrated mayor of Newark and the front-runner to be the next senator from New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Booker pointed me toward his angry essay while on a visit to Washington last week. We spoke over a late breakfast the day before President Barack Obama went to the White House briefing room to issue his powerful reminder to Americans that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It tells us something important about America in 2013 that two exceptionally successful African-American men, both of them widely acclaimed across the lines of race, chose independently to underscore the same truth about the Martin killing: that, in the president's words, &quot;the African-American community is looking at this issue though a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And both focused resolutely on how to make things better. My interview with Booker didn't start with the Zimmerman trial. Instead, the mayor spoke enthusiastically about a program he had established in cooperation with the libertarian-conservative Manhattan Institute to help men released from prison become better fathers. &quot;The right intervention,&quot; he said, &quot;can create radically different outcomes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Booker knows about crime. He described his experience of holding a young man who had just been shot, trying and failing to keep him from dying in his arms. He returned home disconsolate and washed off the young man's blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His account, and Obama's later words, put the lie to outrageous claims by right-wing talk jocks and provocateurs that those upset by the outcome in the Zimmerman trial are willfully ignoring the affliction of crime committed by African-Americans against each other. On the contrary: African American leaders, particularly mayors such as Booker, were struggling to stem violence in their own communities long before it became a convenient topic for those trying to sweep aside the profound problems raised by the Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Booker fully accepts that there is a right to self-defense. &quot;One of the things I learned from the good cops is that there were some times when they were completely justified in pulling their weapons and killing somebody,&quot; he said. But those good cops, he insisted, also understood that their first obligation was &quot;to defuse a situation,&quot; to try to prevent violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman, Booker added, &quot;having been told by the police to back away, had so many opportunities to defuse the situation.&quot; And, as the president suggested, &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws have exactly the opposite effect: They encourage, rather than discourage, confrontation, particularly on the part of a person with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why, Booker wonders, do we have our famous conversations about race only &quot;when things go terribly wrong&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we neared the end of our chat, he offered a thought you are more likely to hear from a preacher than a politician. &quot;Fear is a toxic state of being,&quot; Booker said. &quot;You've got to lead with love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking to Booker was a reminder of the bundle of contradictions that is the story of race in America, precisely what Obama was underscoring when he spoke of our progress as well as our difficulties. Booker &amp;#8212; again, like the president &amp;#8212; was concerned above all with the practical things government and society can do to battle child poverty and reverse rising inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the central problems of our time, Booker said, is &quot;the decoupling between wage growth and economic growth,&quot; a development that creates so many other social challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dignity and grace of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family should inspire us all to keep our eyes on the future. We should not blind ourselves either to the persistence of racism or to our triumphs in pushing it back. That is the message of Booker's old column, and it harmonizes with the candid words from our first black president. We have come a long way and have a long way to go.</SPAN></P>

It's a little past 2 in the morning on New Year's Day 2009, and the cars are packed with revelers returning to the East Bay from the fireworks and celebrations in San Francisco. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there on the platform, leaning against a wall and ringed by BART police, is Oscar Grant. A 22-year-old African-American who had been taken from the train in the wake of a disturbance, Grant is seen arguing with officers, talking on his cellphone, and then pinned to the ground. You can hear a shot on the phone's audio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the BART cops had fired his gun at close range. Grant, unarmed, died hours later at a hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fruitvale Station,&quot; boasting a deeply nuanced performance by Michael B. Jordan as Grant, reconstructs - and, in some instances, reimagines - the events of the day and night leading up to this tragic episode. It's an episode that can't help but reverberate now, in the days following the Florida trial of George Zimmerman, acquitted in the shooting death of young African-American Trayvon Martin. But while issues of race, rage, and the use of deadly force are at the heart of both stories, it does the victims an injustice to lump them together. (The police officer in the Grant case was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that is exactly the strength of writer/director Ryan Coogler's &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot;: It humanizes Grant, makes him something more than another grim statistic. Showing Grant as an imperfect but affable man, a guy whose friends called him &quot;Osc&quot; and who went out of his way to please whoever he was with, the film avoids the trap of setting its protagonist up as a hero, a saint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wants to be a good father to the daughter he has with his girlfriend, Sophina (a very good Melonie Diaz). He makes plans for the birthday dinner for his mother (Octavia Spencer). He tries to assure Sophina that his cheating days are done with. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he isn't straight with her about his job - he was let go at the supermarket. We see flashbacks to his time in San Quentin - he had been convicted of selling drugs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now, with no paychecks coming in, he's tempted to start dealing again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a beautifully tough scene midway through &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot;: Grant finds a stray dog, injured, along the side of the road. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment is as close as things get to being heavy-handed - illustrating Grant's sense of struggle and isolation, and foreshadowing the violence to come. But Jordan holds back, and the handheld camera turns and wheels with restraint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oscar Grant had friends, he had a sister and a mother and a grandmother, a girlfriend, a child. In concise measures, &quot;Fruitvale Station&quot; shows us these connections, these bonds. And it shows us the everyday pressures and problems, the joys and pleasures, experienced by someone moving through life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then that BART train pulls into Fruitvale, and the rest is history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is planning to transfer two Guantanamo Bay detainees to Algeria, the first movement of terrorist suspects from the prison since the president announced a renewed push to close the contentious military-run facility in Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House said Friday that it was starting the transfers as part of President Barack Obama's goal to close the prison, a campaign promise that has eluded him since he took office. The move signaled a new push to reduce the population of 166 detainees at the prison, where dozens are on a hunger strike to draw attention to their indefinite detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House said the two detainees will not be identified until after the transfer, which can't come until after a 30-day waiting period. Administration officials also wouldn't say what security assurances they had from the Algerian government as part of the arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's mom: 'Use my broken heart' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PHILADELPHIA -- The mother of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed Florida teenager whose fatal shooting by a neighborhood watch volunteer has provoked a national debate over racial profiling and gun laws, appealed to a crowd of black advocates here Friday to &quot;use my broken heart&quot; to prevent a repeat of what happened to her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My message to you is, please use my story, please use my tragedy, please use my broken heart to say to yourself, 'We cannot let this happen to anybody else's child,' &quot; Sybrina Fulton said during a brief but emotional luncheon talk to a gathering of the National Urban League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She received a standing ovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spanish train driver placed under arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain -- A veteran train driver with a zest for speed was arrested in his hospital room in northwestern Spain where investigators are trying to determine whether reckless behavior caused a train wreck that left dozens of passengers dead, the authorities said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver, Francisco Jose Garzon Amo, 52, is the focus of a criminal investigation, according to Jaime Iglesias, the national police commander from Galicia who said at a news conference that investigators were waiting for the driver's condition to improve to start questioning him about Wednesday's crash. A judicial inquiry, he added, could also take place in the hospital where he is recovering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs of the driver, his face bloodied, appeared prominently in Spanish newspapers along with screen grabs of the driver's now deleted Facebook page where he bragged last year about topping speeds of 200 kilometers, or 124 miles, per hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paint splashed on Lincoln Memorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Lincoln Memorial was temporarily closed Friday after someone splattered green paint on the statue of the 16th president, though it reopened Friday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent vandalism was discovered around 1:30 a.m. Friday on the statue, the pedestal and the floor, U.S. Park Police said. No words, letters or symbols were visible in the paint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marble Lincoln statute had green paint on its shin, coattail, chair and base, as well as paint on the floor of the memorial building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capt. Steven Booker said the paint spill &quot;appears intentional based off of the splatter.&quot; Police were reviewing security camera footage to try to identify possible suspects, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Death of hacker under investigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO -- A prominent hacker who discovered a way to have ATMs spit out cash and was set to deliver a talk about hacking pacemakers and other wireless implantable medical devices has died in San Francisco, authorities and his employer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barnaby Jack died Thursday, although the cause of death was still under investigation, San Francisco Deputy Coroner Kris Barbrich said. Craig Brophy, a spokesman for computer security firm IOActive, Inc., where Jack worked, confirmed his death and said the company would be issuing a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack, who was in his mid-30s, was scheduled to speak next Thursday at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. The headline of his talk was, &quot;Implantable Medical Devices: Hacking Humans,&quot; according to a synopsis on the Black Hat conference website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack planned to discuss ways manufacturers could improve the security of the devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Whitey' Bulger prosecutors rest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOSTON -- Prosecutors rested their case against reputed Boston gangster James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger on Friday after calling 63 witnesses who described in sometimes gruesome detail his alleged role in 19 murders, a string of extortions and other crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bulger, 83, is charged with 32 counts in a racketeering indictment that chronicles his alleged reign as leader of the Winter Hill Gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bulger's lawyers are expected to begin presenting witnesses Monday. Defense lawyer J.W. Carney Jr. would not say whether Bulger will take the stand in his own defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan's defense chief urges buildup</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOKYO -- Japan should look into acquiring offensive weapons and other new military capabilities and assume a more active role in regional security, the country's defense minister said Friday, giving an early glimpse of how the new conservative government could lead the nation further than ever from its postwar pacifism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister, Itsunori Onodera, said Japan should consider such steps as acquiring weapons to strike bases in hostile countries and aerial drones to monitor Japan's vast territorial waters in response to the growing capabilities of North Korea and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke after his ministry released an interim report on an overhaul of Japanese defense strategy under way by the administration of hawkish Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose Liberal Democratic Party won a decisive election victory Sunday. A new strategy with more specific proposals is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strauss-Kahn faces sex ring charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS -- Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the disgraced former chief of the International Monetary Fund, was ordered Friday to stand trial in France on charges linked to his involvement in a prostitution ring prosecutors say was operating in France and in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges in the northern city of Lille, who have been investigating Strauss-Kahn and a small group of French businessmen and police officials for nearly two years, charged Strauss-Kahn and 12 others with pimping, or &quot;aggravated procurement in a group.&quot; That charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of 1.5 million euros, or about $2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunisia pins killing on al-Qaida allies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TUNIS, Tunisia -- The government Friday blamed a violent Islamist extremist cell linked to al-Qaida for the killing of a top Tunisian political opposition leader and identified the chief suspect, a Parisian-born jihadist, as the person who had killed an opposition figure in February, saying he used the same automatic pistol in both assassinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assertions, made by Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou, came as outrage simmered over the killing of the opposition leader, Mohammed Brahmi, an outspoken liberal politician, outside his home Thursday, witnessed by his wife and children. The public prosecutor's office said an autopsy showed that Brahmi, 58, had been hit with 14 bullets from a 9-mm weapon, six in his upper body and the others in his left leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assassination of Brahmi, an outspoken critic of Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party in power, has revealed a deepening split between Tunisians who want a pluralistic democracy and hard-line Islamists who reject such a system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider Friday night's Skyline Music Festival at Target Field an apparently successful experiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While country superstar Kenny Chesney has sold out the downtown Minneapolis ballpark two summers running, the Twins organization used this concert -- featuring Minnesota favorites the Gear Daddies and Soul Asylum along with Matthew Sweet and Big Head Todd and the Monsters -- to see how a smaller show would do in the gorgeous outdoor venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, the stage sat in foul territory near third base, with seating limited to about a fourth of the stadium. Fans got a great view of the stage, the downtown skyline ... and the vast, empty expanse of the rest of Target Field. Some 6,752 folks attended, which was enough to sell out this limited configuration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the four acts -- save for the Gear Daddies -- are spending the summer together on a package tour. Bob Marley's band, the Wailers, are playing other dates on the tour, but probably missed this one because they're booked to play the Summer Set Music and Camping Festival next month in Somerset, Wis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shtick is that each band is performing one of their classic albums in its entirety: &quot;Girlfriend&quot; (Matthew Sweet), &quot;Grave Dancers Union&quot; (Soul Asylum) and &quot;Sister Sweetly&quot; (Big Head Todd). Those three records all date from the early '90s and it looked like the vast majority of folks in the crowd were in college when the discs first hit the shelves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gear Daddies were already on stage when the afternoon sun was still shining and people were filing into the venue. They turned in a polite, low-key performance that concluded with -- what else -- &quot;(I Wanna Drive the) Zamboni.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthew Sweet, 48, followed by re-creating his 1991 breakthrough &quot;Girlfriend,&quot; an album best known for its infectious title track and the monstrous guitar sound provided by Richard Lloyd and the late Robert Quine. Sweet and his current band nailed the six-string squeal but faltered some in the harmonies department. Sweet also bailed on playing the entire record to make room for his best known song, 1995's &quot;Sick of Myself.&quot; (It's also worth noting that while Sweet sang a song about Winona Ryder, Soul Asylum's Dave Pirner used to date her.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had high hopes Pirner would pull out his SpaghettiOs T-shirt from back in the day, but alas, it didn't make an appearance Friday night. Indeed, Pirner himself was the only remnant from Soul Asylum's classic days. Bassist Karl Mueller died in 2005 (and was the focus of the set-opener, &quot;Oh, Karl&quot;) and guitarist Dan Murphy left the group last year. While Murphy was very definitely missed, Pirner did a decent job on his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dedicated &quot;Black Gold&quot; to Trayvon Martin and, later, said &quot;Without a Trace&quot; usually goes out to Mueller, but this time around was for Slim Dunlap, the former Replacements guitarist who suffered a serious stroke last year and has been honored with the ongoing &quot;Songs for Slim&quot; charity project. At the end of the set, Pirner welcomed Minneapolis singer/songwriter Larry Long on stage for a rousing version of &quot;Stand Up and Be Strong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colorado's Big Head Todd and the Monsters wrapped up the night with the sort of highly polished, easily likable set that has made them a go-to group for this sort of show. Don't be surprised to see the Twins try another Skyline Music Festival next summer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman helped pull Mark and Dana Gerstle and their two children out of a rolled vehicle unharmed last week near the spot where Martin was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's lawyer planned to host the conference, but was forced to call it off after a last-minute change of heart from the Gerstles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A family friend said the Gerstles were ``grateful to Zimmerman for what he did'', but were worried the media would interpret any praise directed at Zimmerman as ``making him into a hero''. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The case for a new review of Stand Your Ground law.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus of those outraged by the George Zimmerman trial has now shifted squarely onto stand your ground laws in Florida and the two dozen other states with similar statutes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Florida lawmakers are joining protesters in demanding Gov. Rick Scott call a special legislative session to consider repeal of the controversial law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott is right to refuse those demands. Summoning lawmakers back to Tallahassee while so many voices are raised in anger would serve only to further entrench both sides, drowning out any thoughtful debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Scott and Republican lawmakers who stand behind the law should be open to making changes to stand your ground during the regular legislative session next spring - changes that address its flaws while ensuring innocent people are allowed to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That can only happen if the debate moves beyond the racially charged Zimmerman trial - and the murky circumstances surrounding the final moments of Trayvon Martin's life. Instead, the debate needs to focus on cases that more clearly illustrate how the law handcuffs law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than dismiss law enforcement's concerns, as happened during previous legislative sessions, lawmakers need to listen to police and prosecutors who must deal with the immunity the law affords to people who use deadly force to extricate themselves from situations they created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether those people wrongly took a life should be left to the discretion of prosecutors, and ultimately to a judge and jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We elect state attorneys, and they have to make these decisions, Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee says. Historically, they have done a good job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee is familiar with cases in Hillsborough where the original aggressor was protected by stand your ground. Cases like those need a review by investigators and prosecutors unencumbered by a state law that grants broad immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every case is different, Gee says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand you ground as a concept is laudable. People in fear of their lives have a right to protect themselves with deadly force, whether in their homes or on the street. But the stand your ground law Florida lawmakers passed in 2005 went too far. Under the law, people have no legal obligation to retreat, even when they are the instigators and when they have the means to avoid the danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In denying calls for a special session, Scott likes to invoke the findings of a task force he empaneled after the Zimmerman shooting but before the verdict. Its findings offered modest changes to the law, such as tweaks that will govern the conduct of neighborhood watch volunteers such as Zimmerman or the ability of police to detain someone who invokes stand your ground during an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those fixes don't address the fundamental problem with a law that protects someone who chooses to start a fight and then ends it with deadly force rather than retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To what degree stand your ground factored into the Zimmerman verdict is debatable. What is clear is that dozens of other self-defense cases have revealed flaws in a law meant to protect innocent people from great bodily harm or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it now stands, the law is open to abuse by those undeserving of its protections. And that needs to change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A quiet, powerful film about a life senselessly taken arrives at a notable point in time.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station is a movie as direct and devastating as a point-blank bullet to the back, like the one that killed Oscar Grant on the first morning of a new year, 2009. Oscar, a 22-year-old African-American, was headed home with friends when they were detained by Oakland transit cops, responding to reports of a fight on a train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun goes off, Oscar's mortally wounded. The shooter - a white officer claiming he intended to use a Taser and mistakenly grabbed his pistol - gets two years for involuntary manslaughter, serving half of that sentence. Several witnesses capture the shooting on cellphone cameras, and within days millions view the footage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writer-director Ryan Coogler's remarkably assured filmmaking debut begins with that raw footage, so we know Oscar's fate. Then he rewinds 26 hours to exemplify who this young man was, and it's a compelling bundle of contradictions played by Michael B. Jordan, who can get his tuxedo pressed for awards season. The first time we hear his voice, Oscar is making resolutions he'll never keep. Unavoidable tragedy to come makes Oscar's every move count, in heartache or hindsight consolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oscar awakens on New Year's Eve with his girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz) and their preschool daughter Tatiana (Ariana Neal). It's his mother's birthday, another reason to be happy, if Sophina wouldn't hassle him about a fling with another woman. Oscar has that kind of duality about him: a loving partner who will cheat, a Chuck E. Cheese's dad who will pay the tab with money made by halfheartedly dealing pot. Even his mother (Octavia Spencer) gives Oscar a tough-love turnaway in prison, one of Coogler's shrewd flashbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We observe a life over a day, not that different from us or people we know. A life flawed by a cloak of street-itude that Jordan playing Oscar slips on and off like silk. The ache is in the domestic details Coogler provides, how those transit officers aren't the first to jump to conclusions about Oscar's motives. A father clowning with his child. The joyous din of a family kitchen. Life before death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the shooting, a gut-wrenching sequence matching eyewitness cameras for effect, and an ER vigil led by Spencer's magnificent sorrow and strength, urging Oscar's loved ones to &quot;lift him up.&quot; Public outcry and the shooter's justice (or lack thereof) are left to end notes rather than the heated rhetoric a less confident filmmaker might employ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fruitvale Station is lean - barely 80 minutes - but Coogler's intentions aren't mean. Vengeance is someone else's, while this movie finds justice in making an unnecessary victim human, not just a statistic or cause. In a sobering coincidence, Coogler's movies arrives at a time when Trayvon Martin can be seen as the latest Oscar Grant, who was the latest Amadou Diallo, who was the latest Rodney King. Lift us up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of the world's hottest musical acts are joining music legend Stevie Wonder in protest of Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law after the George Zimmerman trial, according to social networks and the blogosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various lists name two dozen artists that have canceled tour dates in the Sunshine State indefinitely &quot;UNTIL THE LAW IN FLORIDA IS ABOLISHED!&quot; An Instagram list is populated with world-famous acts such as Justin Timberlake, Jay Z, Rihanna, Rod Stewart, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Alicia Keys, Usher, will.i.am and other groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timberlake is singled out for nixing the kickoff of his tour in Miami because he refused &quot;TO ENTERTAIN A STATE WHO'S GOVERNMENT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SHOOT-N-KILL UN-ARMED TEENAGERS!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PolitiFact is skeptical of chain emails that are typed in ALL CAPS, contain misspellings and do not disclose sources. The meme we've seen (which touts the misspelled names of RIHANA and ALISHIA KEYS as signing on) is a triple whammy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk of Florida boycotts started July 14, the day after Zimmerman's acquittal in the death of Trayvon Martin. Wonder announced he won't perform in Florida until the 2005 &quot;stand your ground&quot; law is abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of fact,&quot; he said, &quot;wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world.&quot; (More than 20 other states have similar &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several musical artists and celebrities reacted to the verdict with anger and disbelief. Many gave musical tributes to Martin, including Beyonce, Young Jeezy, Jay Z and Timberlake, Bruce Springsteen and Wyclef Jean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of the artists publicly announced they are joining Wonder's boycott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it wasn't long before the story crossed over into news coverage. American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan cited &quot;sources close to Stevie Wonder camp&quot; for her Monday report that a similar slate of artists are joining Wonder in support of changing &quot;stand your ground.&quot; Some have already called off concerts, she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her list contained two groups not on the original roundup: Eddie Levert, lead singer of the R&amp;B group the O'Jays, and gospel duo Mary Mary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We love our fans but we MUST do something!!&quot; Mary Mary wrote on Facebook. &quot;We understand a No from us isn't as big as a No from Stevie Wonder but if all our voices join together we can REALLY change things!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the only artists from Ryan's list who have announced they are joining Wonder's effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We did our own reporting. Most of the artists do not have upcoming tour dates in Florida. Rihanna, for example, was just in Tampa in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This leg of Rod Stewart's tour hasn't ever included Florida dates, so that isn't accurate,&quot; said Hannah Kampf, a spokeswoman for Stewart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madonna did not join the boycott, spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg told us. Neither did Keys, whose spokeswoman said in a statement, &quot;We question the validity of this list since Alicia's name along with many others has appeared erroneously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the Rolling Stones told Mother Jones no one in the band had &quot;heard anything about this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timberlake and Jay Z do have their shared &quot;Legends of the Summer&quot; concert Aug. 16 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Timberlake has another concert planned for December in Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the shows are off, no one told the ticket vendors, updated either artist's website or informed the venues. Sun Life Stadium tweeted us the concert &quot;is on as scheduled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funk maestro George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, also named among artists boycotting Florida, is scheduled to play in Tallahassee on July 28. We found nothing to contradict that. And funk stars Maze and Frankie Beverly are still slated to perform at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg on Sept. 15, a spokeswoman confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet is rife with claims of Wonder's beefed-up Florida boycott. But it's short on proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We rate this statement False.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said the history of African-Americans partially explains the way many black people view the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke of blacks hearing car doors lock as they cross the street and of white women who clutch their purses tightly when a black person enters an elevator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he touched on the real problem: &quot;Now, this isn't to say that the African-American community is naive about the fact that African-American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence. It's not to make excuses for that fact, although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context. We understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country, and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, but what about poor people in the same neighborhoods who don't engage in violent behavior? What values are they being taught? Don't they have the same history, but make different choices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not news that much poverty in the African-American community stems from broken or never-started families; or that too many black men leave black women to raise children on their own; or that the way &quot;gangsta culture&quot; is portrayed in the media does not produce an image that is endearing to white employers; or that public schools in minority neighborhoods are failing to build the foundations necessary for a successful life; or that the abortion rate among black women is four times higher than non-Hispanic whites among 15-to-19 year-olds, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abortion, which the president has done nothing to curtail, also devalues African-American lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politics of race plays a role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When black people kill each other, or murder a white person, the president usually feels no need to comment (the recent murder of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton being a rare exception); Al Sharpton doesn't march, Jesse Jackson doesn't call for boycotts or label Florida an &quot;apartheid state,&quot; as he did following the Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are black lives only worth mentioning when they are extinguished by non-blacks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are black people who are disgusted by the behavior, clothing, attitude and language of some young black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Washington Post's website last week, beneath a transcript of the president's remarks last Friday, a reader posting under the name &quot;Chaquita1&quot; offered a personal story about recently being on a train and watching an African-American woman give the evil eye to a pair of young African-American males in &quot;gangsta wear&quot; making a commotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They became belligerent, talking about &quot;the fat lady glaring at them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman arose, Chaquita1 wrote, &quot;and said 'Trayvon&nbsp;Martin died for nothing. His death did not empower you, it should have been a wake-up call.' She then returned to her seat, looked straight at me and said, 'You have white trash. We have black trash.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussions like this should be included in any &quot;conversation about race&quot; the president says he wants, along with how such attitudes and behavior contribute to racial conflict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWMARKET -- A Newmarket man is behind bars after being accused of scrawling racially motivated messages on street signs around town, threatening his neighbors, and living in a house as a convicted felon with access to nearly 40 guns, some of them loaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian T. Croall, 44, of 20 Durrell Drive, was arraigned Wednesday on firearms and drug charges resulting from a search of his home on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search followed his arrest on July 17 in connection with a vandalism spree involving offensive and racist messages written on 14 town- and state-owned signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Handwritten notes were also found on his land and on trees and telephone poles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Works Director Richard Malasky estimated the damage to the signs to be about $1,650.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, some of the messages referenced the recent trial of George Zimmerman, a Florida man acquitted on July 13 in the high-profile killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newmarket police prosecutor Michael DiCroce said at least one of the messages referred to Zimmerman as a hero while other graffiti included a swastika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DiCroce said he feels Croall is a danger to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've had complaints by numerous neighbors about his activities in the neighborhood,&quot; he said, adding that the neighbors who were allegedly threatened are concerned about their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DiCroce added, &quot;Given the fact of what he wrote, the swastika, the derogatory terms toward African-Americans, Hispanics, gays, elderly, I think he is a danger to this community. Those guns just weren't sitting there (in his house). They were loaded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the police complaints, Croall allegedly threatened neighbors who drive a red Cadillac CTS with paper signs posted in the neighborhood that read, &quot;Hey tough guy red CTS I'll beat in front of you family.&quot; Another message threatened, &quot;Hey red CTS time for a beating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DiCroce said authorities are considering pursuing hate crime charges and will speak with the U.S. Attorney's Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While investigating the threatening messages, police obtained a search warrant and during a search of his home Tuesday found at least a dozen firearms in plain view, DiCroce said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police discovered as many as 39 firearms in the residence along with more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, DiCroce said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Croall, who lives about a quarter-mile from Newmarket schools, isn't allowed to have access to firearms because he was convicted of felony reckless conduct in August 2012 after firing a handgun into the air outside of the Chop Shop restaurant in Seabrook on Nov. 20, 2011. He fired the weapon after complaining that his car radio was stolen and nobody was helping him, prosecutors said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police also found a small amount of marijuana, drug paraphernalia and the drug oxycodone for which he didn't have a prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Croall is charged with two counts of criminal threatening, criminal mischief, theft by unauthorized taking for allegedly stealing a solar light from a neighbor, possession of a controlled drug, possession of a narcotic drug and being a felon in possession of firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Wednesday's arraignment in the 10th Circuit Court in Seabrook, defense attorney Joseph Plaia told Judge Mark Weaver that Croall's mother confirmed the guns belonged to his father, who died within the past year, and that the oxycodone had also been taken by his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, DiCroce argued that it doesn't matter if his father had owned the guns. He said Croall was living alone in the house and had access to them as a convicted felon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaia argued for lower bail, saying Croall has diabetes and if he is released he could move out of his Newmarket residence to live at a home in Stratham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bail was set at $50,000 cash or corporate surety while bail in the vandalism and criminal threatening case remains at $25,000 cash.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cal Thomas is a conservative columnist. Bob Beckel is a liberal Democratic strategist. But as longtime friends, they can often find common ground on issues that lawmakers in Washington cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today: Zimmerman verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOB: Whether you agree with the verdict in the Zimmerman/Martin trial, or not, it's over. The emotions it unleashed in the black community, however, are far from over. Last weekend in hundreds of demonstrations across the country, blacks rose up to denounce the verdict. Some demonstrations were violent, but most were not. What this trial has launched is another debate about race, again raising familiar issues that continue to be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAL: America doesn't do trials by mob. We have a jury system. President Obama acknowledged the trial was fair. The prosecution couldn't prove its thin case. Investigators said race was never an issue, but it became one thanks to the &quot;usual suspects&quot; who make money, gain political power and appear on TV by keeping us divided. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOB: President Obama's statement on race was excellent. He explained why there is unrest in the black community, despite the fact that many blacks like Bill Cosby accepted the verdict. What the president was trying to tell whites and other races is that despite enormous advances in civil rights, an undercurrent of racism still leads to the targeting of too many black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAL: I agree with Cosby that the trial wasn't about race, and I agree with the president that there has been great progress in civil rights. That progress and showcasing people who have overcome challenges ought to serve as &quot;you can do it&quot; examples, rather than constantly focusing on &quot;racism,&quot; which can be used as an excuse for failure rather than an obstacle that can be overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOB: As you know, Cal, my dad was deeply involved in the civil rights movement in the 1950s and '60s. He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King and was jailed in the South many times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAL: I know you followed in your father's footsteps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOB: I did. I was involved in black voter registration drives in the 1970s and experienced firsthand the level of violence and racism that still existed in the South. Racism was also entrenched in many northern neighborhoods. Race relations have come a long way, but those who believe racism is behind us are living an illusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAL: We're focusing on the wrong thing, Bob. The problems in the black community aren't mainly caused by racism. The out-of-wedlock birth rate among black women, for example, is two-and-a-half times higher among 15- to 19-year-olds than non-Hispanic whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Black babies are aborted at a higher rate than any other group, further cheapening African-American life. The president is a champion of &quot;abortion rights&quot; but says nothing about the carnage in his own community. Democratic politicians won't agree to school choice to allow poor black children to escape failed schools. I could go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOB: Few whites have experienced the disgraceful profiling of blacks that exists to this day, especially among police and wannabe cops such as George Zimmerman. The anger in the black community was less about an awful verdict and Florida's barbaric &quot;stand your ground&quot; law than it was about the indiscriminate stopping and searching of blacks by police without cause, and subtle things like locking car doors when a black man crosses a street, or following black shoppers. There are many more examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAL: I grant all of that and have seen it myself, but the media play a role in promoting negative images of African Americans. The evil &quot;gangsta rap&quot; culture that disrespects women and clothing that shouts &quot;I'm dangerous&quot; don't help build bridges between races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOB: Blacks and whites for the most part have not integrated. They tend to cluster in their own communities, attend their own churches and stay close to their neighborhoods. I confess that we liberals, with the best intentions, inadvertently contributed to this clustering in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAL: I sense a long overdue mea culpa coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOB: Perhaps. Two examples. We built public housing projects that provided low-rent homes predominantly to minorities. These projects contributed to the isolation of blacks in subpar housing that most whites would not rent while many blacks had no other option. Many of these projects became infested with crime and drugs. Busing students miles out of their communities to attend school was also a failure and further contributed to racial animosity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAL: We must start reading from another script, Bob. We need to hear and see more inspirational stories of African Americans who have overcome difficult circumstances. In recent months, many have become aware of Dr. Ben Carson, who rose from inner city Detroit and a poor and dangerous neighborhood to great success as chief pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University hospital. He didn't spend his time singing We Shall Overcome -- he overcame. More stories like his -- and they're out there -- might inspire more young African Americans to follow his example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOB: There has been progress in race relations, but there is hidden racism that blacks experience and whites don't understand. That's what propelled last weekend's protests as much as the killing of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAL: I agree about &quot;hidden racism,&quot; as you call it, but while it will never be completely erased, its power can be diminished. Most Americans want to see other Americans succeed, regardless of race. Along with the president, I applaud the progress that has been made. The path to even greater progress is to stop using race as an excuse for failure and start embracing the rules that can improve any life. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's another face appearing on protest signs and pamphlets at Trayvon&nbsp;Martin rallies across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of Marissa Alexander, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, is gaining national attention through online petitions, social media and protests in the aftermath of the George Zimmerman acquittal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 32-year-old African-American mother of three from Jacksonville fired what she says was a warning shot at a wall during an argument with her husband, Rico Gray, in 2010. Gray was not wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander had a protective order against her husband at the time because he had beaten her in the past. She had no criminal record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her lawyers tried to get the case dismissed before trial under Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, but the court rejected the argument, saying Alexander fired out of anger, not fear for her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 20 states have &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, which generally allow the use of lethal force for self-defense without the duty of trying to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida Assistant State Attorney Richard Mantei told USA TODAY that much of the discussion about the Alexander case is inaccurate -- and social media are partly to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's fueling the particular attention is a false narrative that's getting repeated as if it's actually true,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mantei said Alexander rejected a plea deal that would have gotten her three years in prison. Instead, she decided to go to trial and was sentenced to 20 years under a Florida minimum-sentencing law regarding the use of firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Alexander pointed her gun in the direction of Gray, and his two children, who feared for their lives, fled the house and immediately called 911. The bullet came close to hitting Gray's head, the documents say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander's face was seen on protest signs and pamphlets at vigils for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin across the country Saturday. Rallies calling for Alexander's conviction to be overturned have been held in Oakland and Jacksonville. Petitions on change.org, whitehouse.gov, moveon.org and thepetitionsite.org have thousands of signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander's lawyers have filed an appeal of her conviction in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jesse Jackson met with Alexander for an hour July 16 and phoned Florida State Attorney Angela Corey to discuss Alexander's charge and sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey, who prosecuted Alexander and filed second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, answered Jackson's questions about the prison sentence and reiterated the prosecution's case, said Jackelyn Barnard, the director of communication for the Florida State Attorney's Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimmerman and Alexander cases show how &quot;stand your ground&quot; and other laws are applied unfairly to minorities, said Janaye Ingram, the Washington bureau chief of Al Sharpton's National Action Network.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Death threats were the last type of phone calls George A. Zimmermann, 78, thought he would get after serving 55 years as his Pennsylvania community's preacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he never thought he would be mistaken for the man headlining news these days: George Zimmerman, the Sanford, Fla., neighborhood watch volunteer acquitted in the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmermann, 78, retired to Deland, Fla., 16 years ago from Georgetown United Methodist Church in Paradise, Pa. He says his time in Florida had been peaceful and uneventful -- until the phone calls began trickling in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Zimmermann, he started receiving the calls immediately after Zimmerman (with one n), 29, shot the teenager.  He says they were tame in comparison with the one he got July 14, a day after the verdict was reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey (expletive), you're the one who killed Trayvon Martin ...  you're dead,&quot; the caller said in a message left on the answering machine,  according to a report by Daytona news station WFVT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmermann reported the incident to the Volusia County Sheriff's Office. &quot;I know they're venting their emotions, but I had no idea that my name would create such a hassle,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmermann says a couple of the calls have been from out-of-state numbers, but more have been from Florida. He has changed his phone number, and since July 14, he has not received any more intimidating calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're just shooting in the dark,&quot; Zimmermann says. &quot;It doesn' t make sense -- I'm in a different town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I guess when you're upset you do things without rationally thinking about it,&quot; he said. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fall from grace has caused our alienation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rallies for Trayvon Martin seek to bring to light divisions in our society, but they miss their mark in two ways. They look at just one division among many, and they fail to offer an adequate solution to humanity's fundamental alienation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a species, we constantly judge one another. If someone is better off than us, we jealously assume they are greedy. If they are poor, we hold them in contempt and blame them for their laziness. We discard our &quot;useless&quot; elders to homes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From campus to the military we assault our women. We made commodities of their bodies and subject them to sexual harassment. If a woman is pretty, she is treated as brainless. If she's not pretty, she is socially outcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We allow foreigners to immigrate and work here for decades, but move to deport them when the political winds change. We cannot discuss members of the opposing political party without demeaning and slandering them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are we divided from one another? As Christians have long recognized, when we broke from our source, we went in a myriad of directions and thereby became incapable of truly connecting with one another. Only in communion with God can we rightly relate to one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all long for the brotherhood of mankind, but we cannot have that without first recognizing the fatherhood of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Monte Knetter, Sun Prairie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alzheimer's and mercury connection possible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's editorial, &quot;Dementia studies connect dots,&quot; while factual overall, states we do not know the cause of these conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I disagree. Features of Alzheimer's disease are present in studies examining cell and tissue damage caused by mercury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the most damaging sources of mercury today are mercury dental amalgams, compact fluorescent light bulbs (when broken) and vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are concerned about dementia, I suggest avoiding these products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Michael Wagnitz, Madison</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Need carbon tax that provides direct rebates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has hell frozen over? It's hard to imagine that happening with the intensifying incidence of droughts and heat waves as greenhouse gases blanket the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet strange happenings may make a frozen hell seem possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, when conservatives such as Steve Chapman, in his Sunday column &quot;How to prosper and fight global warming,&quot; cite economist Adele Morris of the centrist Brookings Institution to explain and justify a new tax strategy to address climate change, then maybe there is hope for the improbable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news? They join many politicians and economists across the spectrum who advocate a carbon tax to steadily raise fees on fossil fuels. Such a carbon tax drives down emissions and drives up use of clean energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bad news? The carbon tax Chapman sketches does not return all revenue to the public directly but offsets its cost with reductions in other taxes. This ensnares carbon tax action with the monumental task of rewriting the tax code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expedite action with a carbon tax and dividend strategy that avoids increasing net government revenue and rebates the money directly to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Kermit M. Hovey Jr., Middleton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now abortion supporters know gun owners' gripe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberals have their undies in a bunch over the new abortion legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps they can now begin to understand how we gun owners feel about their constant attacks and infringements on our Second Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To paraphrase the anti-gun left, no one is taking away your right to an abortion. These are just reasonable controls and restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- John Clendenning, Montello</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profits may be up, but not for everyone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's ironic how many of our elected officials are quick to cut programs and services they say we can't afford for needy people receiving unemployment compensation, food and medical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may regard these people as lazy and undeserving freeloaders ripping off the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these same officials have no qualms over paying billions of tax dollars in subsidies to agribusiness, energy companies, cotton producers, sugar manufactures and so on, all in the name of jobs, even though these industries are raking in profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These profits are used to pay increased dividends to shareholders due to their increased efficiencies (code for reduced worker pay and benefits). Our officials don't offer any reductions here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't begrudge companies making a profit, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the workers. As an investor, I'm willing to accept a lower dividend if the companies reinvest in their employees, allowing them to earn a living wage and receive some benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the few jobs being created, many are for workers from temporary agencies. Workers earn little pay and receive no benefits, allowing companies to continue to reap enormous profits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How many baseballs are used in a major league game and what is done with the used balls?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--- Terry Campbell, Big Canoe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: About 120 balls are used during MLB games, but that figure varies depending on weather conditions, the length of the game and the number of balls hit or tossed out of play, among other variables. There were about 15-18 dozen (180-216 balls) used during a 15-inning game between the Minnesota Twins and Milwaukee Brewers last year, according to a Fox Sports North article. In 2005, it was estimated that more than 900,000 balls were used during an average MLB season, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Balls that don't have much wear are sometimes used for pregame batting and infield practice. They also can be used in indoor batting cages or sent to minor league teams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Why was Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., and not in Miami Gardens in the middle of the school year? Sanford is approximately 250 miles from Miami Gardens. How did he plan to get back to school on Monday, Feb. 27?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--- Trish Ranck, Atlanta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Martin, who was a junior at Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School in Miami, was serving a 10-day suspension from school when he was shot on Sunday, Feb. 26, 2012. He had been caught with an &quot;empty plastic bag with traces of marijuana in it,&quot; according to a police report obtained by the Miami Herald. Martin was visiting with his father at his father's girlfriend's condominium in Sanford. It was Martin's third suspension, the paper reported. The others were for defacing school lockers with graffiti and for tardiness and truancy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I had a son like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, I would love him dearly and unconditionally. I would remember the first time I ever held him; I would remember his favorite toy; I would remember the cute things he would say; and I would remember his smile that would light up the room. I would look at all his pictures in the photo album. I would look at Trayvon's picture when he was 12 and think what an angel he is. I would look at that picture and become sad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to my baby? He changed. He is 17, and I don't know who he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want my precious son back. I peek at his phone and see the gun in his hand. Oh my God, whom has he gotten involved with? I've told him to stay away from those boys. I look at the woman's jewelry in one of the pictures. Could my baby be one of the thieves that I hear about in the news? I ask him about it, and he denies everything. I look on the phone, and see the drugs. I hope he stops before he is in too deep. Please, Trayvon, stop, don't become a dealer or, worse, an addict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People would see my son as a thug, but they don't know the real Trayvon. He was such a beautiful child, a true delight when he was younger. I don't know where the anger came from. I know he used racist language, but he certainly didn't learn that from me. He began skipping school, and I have been there talking to them about Trayvon. He is such a smart kid. He should be getting much better grades than he is. I can't even talk to Trayvon anymore. I want my baby back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've told him nothing good ever happens after dark. I've told him I don't like his friends, and why doesn't he hang out with that nice boy down the street? I've confronted him so many times, and he ignores me. I love my boy, and want him back. Maybe once these rough teen years are over with. If anything happens to him, I will be heartbroken. I would wonder how much our break-up has affected him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My Trayvon is gone, and I am in total shock. My son, my son. Tears won't stop. The pain will never stop. I try to put the blame on the murderer. I want revenge. Someone will pay for taking my son from me. If I had a gun, if I had a gun. The tears won't stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon, why? Why did you change? This was not the real you. I am so sad, so numb, I can't go on anymore. I love you so much, son. Living has become very difficult without you. I don't blame the man who did this, I don't believe he was racist. I feared this day would come, but never imagined your death being the result. I want you back, I want you back, I want my baby back. God, look after my son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I had a son like George Zimmerman, I would love him dearly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama rarely misses an opportunity to insert himself into an issue. Last Friday, he appeared in the White House pressroom to comment on the George Zimmerman verdict. The president said he could have been Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Not likely, given his private schooling and the way he was fast-tracked to success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE PRESIDENT said the history of African-Americans partially explains the way many black people view the case. He spoke of blacks hearing car doors lock as they cross the street and of white women who clutch their purses tightly when a black person enters an elevator. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he touched on the real problem: &quot;Now, this isn't to say that the African-American community is na?ve about the fact that African-American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence. It's not to make excuses for that fact, although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context. We understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country, and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, BUT WHAT about poor people in the same neighborhoods who don't engage in violent behavior? What values are they being taught? Don't they have the same history, but make different choices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not news that much poverty in the African-American community stems from broken or never-started families; or that too many black men leave black women to raise children on their own; or that the way &quot;gangsta culture&quot; is portrayed in the media does not produce an image that is endearing to white employers; or that public schools in minority neighborhoods are failing to build the foundations necessary for a successful life; or that the abortion rate among black women is four times higher than non-Hispanic whites among 15- to 19-year-olds, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Abortion, which the president has done nothing to curtail, also devalues African-American lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLITICS of race plays a role. When black people kill one another, or murder a white person, the president usually feels no need to comment (the recent murder of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton being a rare exception); Al Sharpton doesn't march, Jesse Jackson doesn't call for boycotts, or label Florida an &quot;apartheid state,&quot; as he did following the Zimmerman verdict. Are black lives only worth mentioning when they are extinguished by non-blacks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are black people who are disgusted by the behavior, clothing, attitude and language of some young black men. On The Washington Post's website last week, beneath a transcript of the president's remarks last Friday, a reader posting under the name &quot;Chaquita1&quot; offered a personal story about recently being on a train and watching an African-American woman give the evil eye to a pair of young African-American males in &quot;gangsta wear&quot; making a commotion. They became belligerent, talking about &quot;the fat lady glaring at them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WOMAN arose, Chaquita1 wrote, &quot;and said 'Trayvon&nbsp;Martin died for nothing. His death did not empower you, it should have been a wake-up call.' She then returned to her seat, looked straight at me and said, 'You have white trash. We have black trash.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussions like this should be included in any &quot;conversation about race&quot; the president says he wants, along with how such attitudes and behavior contribute to racial conflict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHY NO OUTCRY of a hate crime for the assault on Riverwalk Augusta? Because it wasn't one. No more than the Zim-merman case was. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I WISH THE local police would enforce the smoke-screen laws. These hopped-up diesel pickups love to smoke out people walking, bicycling or foreign cars at intersections. One day they will cause an accident because of the on-purpose black soot exhaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I AM SORRY FOR the guy who had three computers and $400 in cash stolen from his car outside his residence. But really, who in their right mind would leave these items in their car and not expect them to be a target for criminals? Let's not make it easy for those criminals to rip us off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONCE AGAIN I was in need of the cardiac cath lab at the downtown VA, and the staff took excellent care of me. I have never been treated so fast and in such capable hands as Dr. Alavi, Dr. Mandawat, Mrs. Reese, Cindy, Theresa, Jan and the always funny Orlando. I thank them for their dedication and making a not-so-good event bearable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RANT TO THE Rich-mond County Board of Education. Why with all the cuts in education, Richmond County has summer school students going to school for free? Not free, taxpayers paying for it. Why are the parents of these students not paying? Buses pick students up with only a few students on the bus and also school staffers all costing the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS HARD TO believe that Augusta leads the nation when it comes to infant mortality rates. It is three times the state rate and more than six times the national average. In this day and age, it should not be too difficult to get to the bottom of this and take the necessary actions to turn things around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABORTIONS? Who cares? Black on black crime? Who cares? Thugs attacking the innocent? Who cares? Zimmerman defending himself? Racism! Racism!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOW THAT THE George Zimmerman murder trial is over, can the media go back and cover stories that have fallen by the wayside such as Benghazi, IRS scandals, spying on the public, etc? I know that they are not as exciting, but we need the media attention so that we can get to the facts and maybe find out who really was responsible for what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NO MORE Paula Deen; no more Trayvon Martin. Please investigate the real stories now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Reza Sharifi: &quot;The Reformists' Share From Rouhani's Cabinet.&quot; Sharifi says that, while the role of the reformist figures, such as former President Khatami and presidential candidate Aref, in the victory of President-elect Rouhani should not be ignored, due to the facts such as the presence of a large number of principle-ist MPs in the Majlis, the reformists should not directly participate in the next government's cabinet. He says: &quot;On the one hand, the reformists, by assuming positions such as advisers to the president or ministers can play a proper role in the government by presenting their constructive plans, and on the other hand save themselves from hardliners. Moreover, if some of their plans do not pan out for any reason, such as the objection of totalitarian forces or the government's under-performance, they can explicitly announce their criticism. Therefore, the reformist current can remain as a 'trusted adviser' and 'modest critic' for the government, and prevent the defeated currents from separating the government from the voters by exaggerating some of its possible weak points.&quot; (992 words) </SPAN></P>

He goes on to say that &quot;improving the managerial position of the Central Bank can be considered the main field of the economic test of the new government,&quot; adding that &quot;the way that the 11th government faces this issue represents its policy and economic performance in the future.&quot; Bakhsha'i adds: &quot;In cooperation with the Majlis and the Expediency Council, if the 11th government manages to revive and finalize the issue of promoting authorities and the management of the Central Bank, in addition to recording a major economic achievement for the 11th government, it would also take a major step toward creating economic growth and stability in the country.&quot; (1,615 words) </SPAN></P>

She says: &quot;The type of agreements and relations that America has with India, as a great power with one which is growing, are extremely important from various perspectives, not only for China and Russia, but also for Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.&quot; She reviews the history of these two countries' relationship, going back to WW2 , the Cold War, and the post 9/11 period, and says that, aside from $100 billion in bilateral trade, peaceful nuclear technology exchange, and aid for post-Taliban Afghanistan, these two countries are increasing their military and security relationship as well. She writes: &quot;By growing closer together, these two countries are trying to form an obstacle to the disruption of the balance of power in Asia by China. Also, although in order to preserve Pakistan, America is willing to give any concession or allowance to Islamabad, however, it also uses its relationship with New Delhi as a pressure fulcrum against Islamabad as well. America even uses its relationship with India in its interaction with Iran as well, and the proof of this issue is the lack of success for the Peace Pipeline project thus far.&quot; (592 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Seyyed Emad Hoseyni: &quot;A Coil of Confusion Called the Future of Egypt.&quot; Hoseyni discusses the future prospects of Egypt after the &quot;army coup&quot; that overthrew Muhammad Morsi from power and discusses the possible future role of the MB, Salafis, and even Al-Qa'ida in increasing violent clashes in the country. He discusses a recent announcement by Al-Qa'ida that it would pursue a plan of attack in Egypt which linked the country to the conflict in Syria and says: &quot;Despite the fact that the MB is not considered a Salafi group, however, without doubt, the publications of takfirist [one who holds other Muslims to be infidels] fatwas [religious edicts] of those opposing Morsi and those elements who overthrow him may provide the groundwork for the extensive presence this group's supporter's in armed activities against the central government.&quot; Hoseyni warns that such a violent outcome is not unimaginable and adds: &quot;Today, Egyptian experts are imagining scenarios such as Algeria, Iraq, and even Syria as real possibilities; scenarios that each considered worse than the others.&quot; (509 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Mohammad-Mehdi Mazaheri: &quot;A Coalition Against Democracy in Egypt.&quot; Mazaheri begins: &quot;Today, the MB and its political role is the key for returning Egypt to democracy. This matter requires prudence, compromise, and a national agreement.&quot; He describes the &quot;army coup&quot; against the MB as a means of retaining their power and says: &quot;It seems that power and politics in Egypt will remain with the army, which can give it to anyone it wants for an undefined period of time as a loan, and anytime it wishes, it can take it back.&quot; He criticizes the opposition political groups, including the secularists, liberals, and Salafis, for being short-sighted, then says: &quot;It seems that these forces, after being unsuccessful in several back to back elections against the MB, opportunistically rode a wave of popular demand, when they knew well that neither he nor anyone else would be able to quickly respond to this volume of pent up national demands.&quot; Mazaheri calls their actions a political and strategic &quot;miscalculation,&quot; then says: &quot;The MB, despite all their mistakes, were the only force which had the social and political capacity to create entities in order to confront the domination of the army types in order to create a balance of power in society.&quot; He says that, without this MB capacity, the other groups combined will not be able to stand up to the military at all. Mazaheri writes: &quot;In reality, the coalition of the majority, including the military and the liberal, secular, and Salafi forces, is not a coalition against the MB, rather, it was a coalition against one of the limited possibilities of establishing democracy in Egypt.&quot; (811 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Mohammad Karbasi: &quot;America and Turkey's Difficulties in Syria.&quot; Karbasi reviews recent US congressional debates over the issue of Syria and discusses the &quot;confrontational&quot; conversation between General Martin Dempsey, US chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Arizona Republican Senator John McCain during a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. He begins: &quot;The transfer of arms and attempts to militarily intervene in Syria are the hot topics being discussed these days in America's political circles. In Congress, each day different issues regarding an attack are being discussed with the insistence of extremist Republicans.&quot; He refers to Dempsey's testimony and the general's assessment of five different military options for Syria and their linked costs and characterizes his exchange with Republican senators as &quot;contentious,&quot; while saying that &quot;he described the monetary and political dangers and consequences of these various scenarios for the US senators.&quot; Karbasi concludes: &quot;Utilization of military forces in Syria essentially means the start of war, and avoiding its expansion into an extensive conflict will be difficult. Meanwhile, a group of representatives who are members of the US House Intelligence Committee have announced that, despite the risk of American arms reaching groups dependent on Al-Qa'idah, they want to continue the plan to transfer weapons to the Syrian opposition.&quot; (452 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Qasem Ghaffuri: &quot;Misleading the Egyptian Army.&quot; Ghaffuri says that, concurrent with the beginning of the unrest in Egypt, this country's army has expanded its activities in the Sinai Desert, adding that: &quot;the army claims that paramilitary groups in the region are acting against the security of Egypt.&quot; Ghaffuri says that published reports tell of the army's extensive action in the destruction of Palestinian tunnels that are the only passage through between Gaza and Egypt. Ghaffuri adds: &quot;This matter cannot be overlooked, that the Zionist regime is always seeking to weaken Egypt and to dominate it.&quot; He continues: &quot;Currently, Egypt is engaged in internal developments, while, by misleading the Egyptian Army and pushing them to war with the people of Gaza, the Zionists are trying to take advantage of Egypt to destroy Gaza's resistance, in order to, on the one hand, deprive Egypt of a support called Gaza, and, on the other hand, completely destroy Egypt's regional and international image.&quot; Ghaffuri concludes: &quot;One can say that, currently, the Egyptian Army has begun the war on Gaza being misled by the Zionists, and ultimately, this will not only result in any achievement for the army, but it will also weaken the position of its population.&quot; (452 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Qasem Ghaffuri: &quot;A Look at Two Scandals.&quot; Ghaffuri says that the world community both &quot;condemns America's espionage&quot; and is beginning a sanctions movement against Israel, attributing both developments to the success of &quot;the resistance.&quot; He begins: &quot;Global developments center today around two axes worthy of attention. The first is the international consensus in condemning America's espionage, not only on its own people, but also of all world citizens.&quot; He continues: &quot;The second is that, these days, on the global scene, including Europe, widespread actions have begun to apply economic and even academic and scientific sanctions against the Zionist regime.&quot; He adds: &quot;America and the Zionists are no longer the actors who claimed they could do anything they wanted and no one would prevent them.&quot; He says: &quot;The resistance, based on the global capabilities for confronting America and the Zionists, has become a global phenomenon.&quot; He adds: &quot;These developments show that, by relying on the resistance, big goals and hopes can be achieved.&quot; He concludes: &quot;The global awakening today in the face of the Zionists and the universal approach of the sanctioning of this regime is an adaptation of the pattern that the resistance was able to place before international citizenry in recent years.&quot; (411 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Abdollah Ganji: &quot;Reformists and the Ministry of Science.&quot; Referring to possible reformist efforts to win the Ministry of Science in the upcoming President Rouhani government, Ganji advises the reformists against such efforts and says that although setting policies for universities is a natural fit for reformists -- due to their cultural liberalism, humanism, pluralism, Protestantism, and secularism -- their presence in that ministry will remind the ruling establishment of the reformists' past and will aggravate the situation to the point where &quot;they will lose even the least opportunities&quot; for reform. Ganji says: &quot;The social and academic discourse today is not the discourse of the years after 1376 [year starting 21 March 1997], even the critics and opponents of the regime have shifted their criticism to other areas.&quot; (689 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Mehran Ebrahimian: &quot;The Development of Tourism With Regional Cooperatives.&quot; Ebrahimian argues for the usage of cyber education to create regional tourism cooperatives that would coordinate all aspects of Iran's tourism industry. He concludes: &quot;It is obvious that such a system, thanks to cyberspace (which definitely, in the sector of education of tourism cooperatives) can, with the existence of expert forces, be accountable for natural, historical, and personal tourism. It can also even can be used in the fields of medical tourism, health tourism, and particularly adventure-seeking tourism, naturalist tourism, educational tourism, hard tourism, environmentalist tourism, cultural heritage tourism, black tourism, village-wandering, cultural folklore tourism (like the travel of Marco Polo to Iran and ... [ellipsis as received]), and exercise tourism.&quot; (682 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Ahmad Kazemzadeh: &quot;The Israeli Spoof on the Path of Reconciliation Negotiations.&quot; Kazemzadeh says that the Israeli defense minister had approved plans for the construction of new settlements in the West Bank at the same time as John Kerry's trip there, and says the Israeli Government is using negotiations as a cover for its &quot;expansionist and racist&quot; plans. He says: &quot;The Zionist regime, before the new round of negotiations would begin, with a particular avarice and greed, has added to the intensity and proliferation of its own expansionist and racist plans. Just as, in the past, it is trying to use these negotiations as a cover.&quot; He says, in turn, America and Europe &quot;Did not do anything, not even protesting in a dry and empty way, but instead, by placing Hezbollah on the list of terrorist groups, they gave a big concession to this regime, which can make this regime even more successful.&quot; (575 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unattributed commentary: &quot;Ankara and the Tangled Web of Recent Regional Developments.&quot; The author points to several setbacks facing the moderate Islamist Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, -- the fall of his Egyptian ally President Morsi, continuing domestic protests, negotiations with the Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party, PKK, and the Syrian conflict -- and says that all these issues have driven the Turkish authorities from an offensive to a defensive position. The commentary says: &quot;The Turkish officials, who, in recent years, considered themselves to be the big winner of the regional developments and were looking to take advantage of the Middle Eastern and North African revolutions, now, after the fall of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, have gone into a strange defensive shell.&quot; (577 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unattributed commentary: &quot;America Still Orbiting Racism, Violence.&quot; The commentary says that the &quot;widespread protests&quot; in the United States against the acquittal of a &quot;white youth&quot; charged with the death of a black youth, once again indicate that racism is still alive in the United States. It says: &quot;The protests caused US President Barack Obama to ask them to keep calm and to promise that justice would be done in this regard.&quot; It asks: &quot;Would this issue have ended differently if a white citizen had been killed instead of Trayvon Martin?&quot; It concludes: &quot;Given the atmosphere dominating the American society and the background of past events, it can be said that a racist outlook and presence of violence are institutionalized in the society.&quot; (959 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial: &quot;The Old Wound of Racism in America.&quot; The editorial says that the acquittal of Martin Zimmerman in the fatal shooting case of Trayvon Martin led to widespread protests against the judicial system in the United States. It says that this case has &quot;once again opened the old wound of racism and the rule of the spirit of oppression and tyranny over blacks in America and emphasized the reality that, despite pretentious and deceptive slogans, racism still rules in American society.&quot; It continues: &quot;It is an undeniable fact that the US Government takes a racist stance against blacks; however they have tried to hide this reality in recent years.&quot; It says: &quot;Native Indians in America, who are considered to be the first owners of the country, have never enjoyed legal rights equal to the whites in society.&quot; It concludes: &quot;This racist and discriminatory behavior continues as US politicians boldly expect the world community to accept American society as a model and symbol.&quot; (758 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Sa'dollah Zare'i: &quot;With Quds [Jerusalem], Every Problem Can be Solved.&quot; Zare'i points to the divisions among Muslims and says that the way to unite the Muslim world is through focusing on the common points, such as the effort to take Jerusalem away from Israel, fighting the West's hegemony in the Muslim world, Islamic ecumenical efforts, defending the sanctity of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad, and through defining certain red lines, such as shedding the blood of other Muslims. Zare'i says: &quot;Defending Palestine and the unity of Muslim countries over this issue facilitates the resolution of differences among Muslim countries.&quot; (1,426 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Mohammad-Mehdi Shirmohammadi: &quot;An Opportunity To Review.&quot; Discussing the developments in the recent weeks in Egypt, which led to military's overthrow of President Morsi, Shirmohammadi blames the deposed president's policies toward Israel and the Syrian crisis: &quot;Instead of relying on the Egyptian nation, he relied on the reactionary regimes and America, and sent personal letters to leaders of the illegitimate regime of Tel Aviv.&quot; He adds: &quot;Tempted to receive aid from the Western-Arab front, Morsi supported the Syrian rebels, however he did not know what damage he would sustain from this Western-Arab aid.&quot; While criticizing the United States for avoiding to call Morsi's ouster a coup, he warns unspecified leaders of Arab countries and Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan, saying: &quot;The governments of the reactionary Arab countries and Erdogan, who rely on the guardianship of the Zionists and America, should learn from reviewing what happened to Morsi. Erdogan was considering himself Morsi's older brother, and his Islamist government and the Muslim Brotherhood have a common blood group. Now, Erdogan should seriously review his policies in aligning with the Zionist-American front, especially his behaviour toward Syria.&quot; (481 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Dr Amir Mohebbian: &quot;The 11th Government and the Necessity of a Media Strategy.&quot; Mohebbian says that Iran's 11th government entered the arena with the slogan of &quot;Moderation, wisdom, and hope,&quot; adding that &quot;every part of the slogan started relations with the desires of a class in the society, the result of which was attracting people's votes and winning the election.&quot; He continues: &quot;Beyond what the elite understand, Dr Rouhani's slogans were also welcomed by masses; of course, the elite mostly started relations with its logical introduction and masses communicated with its possible consequences.&quot; Mohebbian says: &quot;There is no doubt that any lack of understanding or misunderstanding between the masses and those in power will cause major problems in administrating the country, and, meanwhile, it is the responsibility of those in power to take action to resolve misunderstandings through awareness.&quot; Mohebbian concludes by saying that &quot;the lack of strategy and a wise media plan will be disastrous for any government,&quot; and adds: &quot;failure to plan means planning for failure.&quot; (781 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by &quot;Middle East expert&quot; Sabah Zangeneh: &quot;The Analysis of a Threat.&quot; Zangeneh says that there is a widespread scenario being implemented in the Middle East, adding that the root of these issues and events can be traced to the &quot;victories in Al-Qusayr,&quot; which he says &quot;disturbed the balance of power&quot; in Syria. He continues: &quot;Based on this disturbance in the balance of power, they [the West] tried to return the conditions to what they were previously, even to conditions prior to the Geneva 2 meeting.&quot; He says that, after providing advanced weapons to the Syrian opposition groups, US senators suggested that the United States play an active military role in Syria, &quot;but this was met with General Dempsey's response that creating a no-fly-zone required hundreds of military aircraft and $1 billion per month.&quot; He concludes: &quot;Apparently, the Syrian region is expecting serious issues,&quot; and &quot;ultimately, the continuation of the war of attrition will be more intensely supported in Syria.&quot; (p 1; 483 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by university faculty member Mansur Mo'azzami: &quot;Sanctions on the Oil Industry: The Musts and Must Nots.&quot; Mo'azzami presents a brief list of solutions for eliminating the sanctions imposed on the Iranian oil industry by &quot;realistically observing&quot; the current conditions. He says the sanctions have caused a reduction in oil income, which, in turn, has slowed the implementation of projects such as those in the South Pars gas field, and adds: &quot;Given the current conditions, even if the ongoing projects are completed -- despite the time elapsed and high costs -- we are forced to choose between not producing from these fields and reducing production from other fields.&quot; He says that sanctions on some specific items that are needed in the oil industry have led to problems, such as the inability to &quot;acquire masts and other items needed for drilling,&quot; which, in turn, prevented &quot;the possibility of the launch of all of South Pars during recent years.&quot; He points to the reduction in exports and production from some wells, he says: &quot;The negative effect of such actions could cause the production objectives to not be realized once the sanctions are lifted.&quot; (p 1, 5; 478 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial by professor Yusef Mowla'i: &quot;The 11th Government and Sanctions.&quot; Mowla'i says that, after the Cold War, the UNSC presented a &quot;very broad interpretation&quot; of peace and international security, by which it imposed sanctions on many countries and groups, such as Iraq, Iran, Al-Qa'idah, and the Taliban. He adds that the United States and the EU have also used such issues as human rights violations and nuclear activities to impose sanctions on countries. He says: &quot;Similar to approving them, repealing and ending sanctions is a political process,&quot; and &quot;the UNSC's method of repealing sanctions shows to be complex and slow.&quot; He continues: &quot;Practically, unless the prescribed goals are realized, the UNSC would not approve an end to sanctions.&quot; Regarding the United States' &quot;unilateral&quot; sanctions, he says: &quot;In some cases, the president can repeal sanctions after reporting to specific committees.&quot; Regarding direct negotiations between Iran and the United States, he says: &quot;Iran is not opposed to the principle of negotiations, but is skeptical of America's goodwill,&quot; and that &quot;America must take effective and practical steps toward repealing sanctions to prove its goodwill.&quot; He adds: &quot;But the repealing of the sanctions imposed by the UNSC involves a very complex political-legal and technical process and we must not expect them to be removed during the 11th government's period.&quot; He says: &quot;America, as a lead player, could play a constructive role in the nuclear case and the gradual removal of sanctions.&quot; He concludes: &quot;Without success on the international arena, it will be very difficult to eliminate economic dilemmas on the domestic arena.&quot; (p 1, 14; 1,410 words) </SPAN></P>

He talks about Israel and says: &quot;Until now, this regime has remained standing with the support of these countries [the West,] and, if one day, the supporting hand of the West is removed from the Zionist regime, that day will be the day of this regime's certain downfall.&quot; Safari also discusses the role of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the United States in supporting &quot;terrorist groups&quot; opposed to the &quot;legitimate Syrian Government,&quot; and writes: &quot;It can simply be said that any group, party, or organization which does not function within the framework of goals set out by Europe and America will be identified as dangerous groups and will be placed on their black lists.&quot; He also says that this action by the EU will have ramifications for Iran's relationship with European countries and may even affect the P5+1 negotiations, and writes: &quot;This action by Europe will also affect Europe's relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and will also possibility affect the atmosphere of nuclear negotiations.&quot; Safari concludes: &quot;These actions and behaviours are the same signs of dishonesty that the supreme leader of the revolution refers to.&quot; (570 words) </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Report on interviews with a number of MPs over &quot;the ifs and buts of increasing the price of energy carriers&quot; by Homa Kabiri: &quot;Ambiguity in Energy Carriers' Price Increase.&quot; Kabiri says that, according to the budget bill of the current Iranian year that started 21 March 2013, the price of the energy carriers should increase, so that the government will be able to use the resulting revenue as part of the government earnings in the budget. Commenting on this issue, Gholamreza Kateb, spokesperson of the Majlis Planning, Budget, and Audit Committee, tells the daily: &quot;If the government only increases in the rates of two energy carriers of gasoline and CNG by 30 percent, the requirements of the law will be met and there will be no need to increase the prices of all energy carriers.&quot; While Kateb urges a prompt increase in the price of energy carriers, Amir-Abbas Soltani, member of the Majlis Energy Committee, says: &quot;There is no need to implement this law; its implementation should be adjusted with the people's economic condition, because one more price increase will cause a new shock to the households' economy and worsen their living condition.&quot; Kabiri ends his report by saying: &quot;It seems that increasing the price of rationed gasoline to 550 tumans [about $0.21] and subsidized gasoline to 1,000 tumans [about 0.4 dollars] will resolve the government's revenue problems.&quot; She adds: &quot;However, it seems that the 11th government should take all the aspects and conditions into consideration and plan a rational increase in the price of energy carriers.&quot; (1,316 words) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentary by Mohammad Sadeqolhoseyni: &quot;Analysis of the Europe's Action Against Hezbollah.&quot; Discussing the recent EU decision to add the military wing of Hezbollah to the list of terrorist organizations, Sadeqolhoseyni says the reason behind this action is the support the Hezbollah provides for the Syrian Army in its conflict with the Syrian rebels: &quot;In fact, the Hezbollah of Lebanon, alongside the Syrian Army, managed to recapture the important city of Al-Qusayr, because of which the Westerners decided to take revenge upon Hezbollah and add this party to the terrorism list.&quot; He concludes by saying: &quot;This action by the EU sent an inappropriate and dangerous message to the region and raises question about the EU's legitimacy. Moreover, the main reason behind this move is to strike a blow on the axis of resistance, because what should be noted is that Hezbollah does not basically have specific military and political wings.&quot; (419 words) </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is a selection of quotes from editorials and commentaries published in 24 July editions of Iranian newspapers available to BBC Monitoring at 0530 gmt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principle-ists still &quot;key players&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arman [moderate]: &quot;In addition to revising the budget for 1392 [2013-14], the 11th government [of President-elect Hassan Rouhani] should take numerous other steps towards correcting the policies of the ninth and tenth governments... Here, the principle-ist movement can play a significant role. Even if we define the composition and nature of the 11th cabinet as being separate from the principle-ist movement, the fact that it still possesses decision-making resources means that this movement will be a key player even if it has absolutely no presence in the government... Given this, two fundamental issues should be considered: First, that Amadinezhad's administration is not the only body responsible for the current situation, which is the result of interactions in the upper echelons of power. Second, that the 11th government cannot solve all these problems and correct improper actions and methods on its own and without political balance in society.&quot; (Editorial by Gholamreza Tajgardun headlined: &quot;Principle-ists, 11th government and corrective steps&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trust-building under Rouhani government </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Javan [conservative]: &quot;The speculations and comments made by reformists, while the 11th government is being formed, show that they are after the Ministry of Science [Research and Technology]... This desire seems commonplace for those already familiar with the history of the reformists, because unlike the principle-ists, the base of support for reformists is not Hezbollah [religious figures], mosques, or religious groups... In Iran, this base is universities... If reformists would like to expunge [what they have done] from their records in the Islamic establishment, they should not do what they did before, because they know that they will never achieve their goals. They will experience the same fate as before when they tasted the bitterness of failure. Therefore, some sound advice for reformists who do not support sedition is that they use Rouhani's presidency as an opportunity for trust-building and compensating for past [behaviours] instead of an opportunity to oppose [the establishment]. (Commentary by Abdullah Ganji headlined: &quot;Reformists and Ministry of Science&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of parties challenge for moderate government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mardom Salari [moderate]: &quot;The concept of moderation, which has been raised by the president-elect [Rouhani], is one which can have a meaning of making the most out of existing talents and potential. With this in mind, we will discuss the necessity for the future government to use all its capacities and work on using Iranian human resources in a proper way in order to be strong, or in other words, to be able to accomplish its goals in a moderate environment. However, there are serious problems in this regard which create problems for group and collective talents... The absence of nation-wide political parties is a serious problem in Iranian society. It is a problem that pushes Iranian society towards group political activities... Another problem is the lack of knowledge based on public opinion. No press can claim to reflect Iranian public opinion... Lack of clarification in the arena of social activities or escaping [this responsibility] is one of the other existing problems with the political culture of Iran's activists and administrators, and this seems to be a cultural problem.&quot; (Editorial by Abdullah Movahed Zadeh headlined: &quot;In which situation moderation will be realized?&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government statistics belie &quot;horrific&quot; economic situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E'temad [reformist]: &quot;The statistics [released by the government] are not acceptable for the people. The people think that the government statistics are those for a different country. One of the statistics that they [Mahmud Ahmadinezhad's administration] gave is on reduction in unemployment. But in reality, what household does not have two or more unemployed youth in it? Another statistic given by the government is on the control of liquidity. At the beginning of the ninth government, the liquidity in the private sector was around 70,000bn tumans [about 28bn dollars]. The government had to control and reduce this amount through the Fourth [Economic] Plan, but it was neither controlled nor decreased. It increased this amount considerably by six times; that is, it reached 420,000bn tumans. These statistics reflect the country's horrific economic situation. In the statistics they gave, they said they took office in the worst of situations whereas they should say they took office in one of the best possible situations! They portray the best situation as the worst one and unfortunately, there is nobody to ask them why they come up with unrealistic statistics... These are all happening because we do not have political parties in the country.&quot; (Editorial by Mohammad Reza Khabaz headlined: &quot;Non-transparent statistics the result of lack of political parties&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rifts in Islamic world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keyhan [hard-line]: &quot;Today, we see that all those who forgot about Al-Quds [Jersualem], are standing beside the intruders and occupiers of Al-Quds while not paying any attention to the security of Muslims. To see evidence of this, look at Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Bahrain... Unfortunately, over the last two years we have witnessed the formation of new rifts in the Islamic world. Today, most parts of this region are involved in conflict and the blood of Muslims is being shed by other Muslims... If only Muslims could agree on some red lines and defend against their enemies [the West]... The shedding of the blood of Muslims by other Muslims is banned by the Koran and this can be considered a red line.&quot; (Commentary by Sadollah Zarei headlined: &quot;All problems will be solved with Al-Quds&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US foreign policy &quot;failures&quot; symbolize Obama's weakness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resalat [conservative]: &quot;US President Barak Obama's popularity is declining with each passing day. The US president's failure to control the economic crisis and the numerous failures of US foreign policy have resulted in Obama becoming a symbol of failure, weakness and inability. Meanwhile, neither are many of the Democrat Party's supporters satisfied with Obama's performance. Obama himself knows well that the main factors contributing to his victory in the 2012 presidential election were the disorganization of the Republicans' camp and Mitt Romney's personal weaknesses... Currently most American citizens believe that Obama's foreign policy is fraught with weaknesses. The reality is that Obama is following in the footsteps of Bush Jr and other former US presidents with respect to foreign policy and there is no difference between the current and former presidents of the USA in this regard.&quot;(Commentary by Ali Reza Sadeqi headlined: &quot;Decline of Obama's popularity&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran-USA talks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharq [reformist]: &quot;The USA has several times suggested holding direct talks between the USA and Iran as a solution to the crisis. Iran does not oppose negotiations, but it is doubtful of the USA's goodwill... It should be stressed that the USA has played a significant role in creating the current crisis and it is considered the main party to the dispute and controversy, and that is why the USA can play a constructive role in [Iran's] nuclear issue and gradual removal of sanctions.&quot; (Editorial by Yusef Mowla'i headlined: &quot;Eleventh government and sanctions&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran to &quot;rethink&quot; EU ties after Hezbollah blacklisting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siyasat-e Ruz [conservative] &quot;Ultimately, the EU has included Lebanese Hezbollah in its list of terrorist groups...to show once again how effective the Zionists' and Americans' ideas and viewpoints are... The EU should take this point into consideration that alongside this injustice and illegal measure, the EU will force the Islamic Republic of Iran to make a decision about this move and rethink its relations with some European countries. The European measure will have effects on relations with Iran... The USA's and West's alleged readiness to hold effective and direct talks with Iran are only a trick and a conspiracy.&quot; (Editorial by Mohammad Safari headlined: &quot;Consequences of including Hezbollah in the list of terrorist groups&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt army serving whose interests?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hemayat [conservative]: &quot;At the same time as Egypt's security problems started to develop, the country's army expanded its measures in the Sinai desert. The army has claimed that militant groups in the area are adopting measures against the Egyptian security. So, the army is conducting extensive military operations in the area at a time when news reports suggest that the army is destroying Palestinian tunnels which are only linking routes from Gaza to Egypt... But the army's attempts to destroy Palestinian tunnels have created doubts in the Egyptian army's actions... This begs the question: Do the army's measures in the Sinai desert and its destruction of Palestinian tunnels fall under Egyptian interests or is Egypt involved in a game which was created by others?&quot; (Editorial by Qasem Ghafuri headlined: &quot;Wrong address to Egyptian army&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murder acquittal opens &quot;racist&quot; wounds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jomhuri-ye Eslami [hard-line]: &quot;The protests and demonstrations against the acquittal of the murderer [George Zimmerman] of an African-American [Trayvon Martin] are still continuing in various US cities... This case has reopened old wounds of racism and oppression against blacks in the US. This incident highlights the fact that despite grandiose rhetoric and misleading claims, racism still dominates American society and the US administration considers blacks as second-class citizens.&quot; (Editorial by News Service headlined: &quot;Old wounds of racism in the USA&quot;)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder announced his decision to protest the state's controversial Stand Your Ground Law by taking the unique stance earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation is blamed by critics for causing upset in the acquittal of accused murderer George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 29-year-old was recently cleared of all charges in the shooting death of an unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin, whom Zimmerman gunned down on the teen's walk home in Sanford, Florida last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the editor of THE EAGLE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, who loves pranks, had one played on him at his recent wedding. As he looked down the aisle, waiting for his lovely blonde bride, whom should he see walking in her place but Gabourey Sidibe, the Oscar-nominated black actress who reportedly weighs over 300 pounds, in a voluminous white gown, as if she were the bride. Jimmy and the guests found this a hilarious joke. The real bride followed soon after, and Sidibe changed her dress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laughter, of course, was for the notion that a big star such as Jimmy could conceivably consider marrying a person of color -- especially an obese one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how far do we think we have we come in conquering racism? Could we imagine George Zimmerman being acquitted on charges of fatally shooting Trayvon Martin had Martin been a white, unarmed teenager, and Zimmerman a black, self-appointed neighborhood watchdog?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are even divided in our opinions of the racial slur by fatty-cooking diabetes-med hawker Paula Deen, who made a tearful supposed confession on television that &quot;I is what I is&quot; and that those who call her more racist than they are should (sniffle) cast the first stone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the Kimmel wedding prank, one could decide that Paula has a point -- she's not alone. We'll see how the Supreme Court's invalidation of part of the Voting Rights Act plays out before we start winding up to throw any stones.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've stayed mum on a number of hot button topics lately. Honestly, my silence has more to do with exhaustion from feeling like I was being drawn into another web of constantly verbally reacting, feeling upset amidst the reinforced powerlessness in regards to what is happening in the world. There were some issues that I was just afraid of commenting about due to the strong reactions and commentary that already existed. There was also the reality of not wanting to add yet another platform to the things that were already being looped into heavy rotation. The latest Paula Deen incident was in my &quot;stay silent&quot; bin. However, I wanted to at least comment very briefly about it while reflecting upon the observation I have about my growing social apathy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fresh after the Paula Deen racial debacle last month, I remember talking to a friend on the phone asking, &quot;What's up with this Paula Deen thing?&quot; At this point, all I knew about the incident was the fact that she was fired from the food network in the midst of accusations over the use of racial slurs. My friend answered &quot;Oh, I guess she used the Nword and now she is in trouble for it,&quot; in a nonchalant, straightforward tone. &quot;Oh,&quot; I responded as we moved onto another topic as if we were just commenting about the weather. In my mind, I connected this incident to the Don Imus scandal and immediately felt that firing did not necessarily address or fix the problem of racism. In fact, forcing the offender who has expressed racist sentiment to go into hiding or step away from the public spotlight is taking away the opportunity for dialogue and open discussion about that which makes us most uncomfortable-race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. This is not in defense of Paula Deen or anyone else who has been in her position. I don't really know Paula Deen as a public figure and to be honest I don't really care to. I've long known of her name and I event contributed to her empire by purchasing an oversized Paula Deen blue cooking pot some time ago. This instead is about a noticing of my feelings or lack thereof about her use of racial slurs. I've noticed incidents like these over the years hit the media and cause temporary outrage among some. Then you have the reaction among others like myself with a certain level of cultural numbness while holding a bag of apathy in a lackadaisical stupor. My reactions to many things in regards to current race relations in this country forces me to question why I bring a shoulder shrug to the situation as opposed to wanting to encourage individuals to be more accountable and responsible for their behavior. Do we expect so little of each other that we will automatically assume the worse especially when it is connected to race or anything else in this country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case in point: In the recent Trayvon Martin case decision, a number of friends (myself included) said the following, &quot;It is Florida. Are we really surprised?&quot; How will we expect things to get better if we are not really doing anything to encourage better behavior? Instead, many like myself have been so accustomed to the moral/ethical low bar that instead of calling anyone to rise above, we are just mildly appeased when they pretend that they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That evening, during the course of the conversation with my friend about the Paula Deen incident, I exclaimed, &quot;Are we really surprised that a southern white woman has been throwing around racial slurs?&quot; In fact, I went on to say that I thought everyone, even the most politically correct among us, used their most private and sacred moments to commit verbal assaults upon any racial, gender, religious, or other groups. In my mind, the homes, hushed corners, or safe space among friends provided the right moment for individuals to think out loud through statements, assumptions, and jokes that one just can't say in polite company. The laws against discrimination due to race, gender, religion, ableism, etc., never changed what resided in the hearts and minds of some. This is the true source of my lack of surprise or minimized shock every time a racial slur is slung or a life is taken within the context of assumptions about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This of course makes me guilty of contributing to the problem rather than being motivated enough to do something about it. Perhaps it illustrates a deeper level of sad-but-true acceptance of my reality as a woman of color in America as I've come to navigate the realities of race, class, gender, education, and so many other &quot;isms&quot; that are inevitably tagged to my person. The navigation of this reality extends to my feelings that the powers that be who make the decisions to fire individuals for their racial slurs are also the ones who may go home and commit their own offenses. I also write this piece outing myself as someone who has and does commit my share of verbal/mental offenses as I walk the spiritual tight rope of &quot;right&quot; speech or &quot;right&quot; thinking. Often, I fail miserably at my attempts as I lend a chuckle to myself while recovering from my stumbled attempts. While I still have not figured out what all of this means for myself, I know that we are all guilty of playing along that spectrum especially in regards to many taboo topics of the day. We just never got publicly caught committing the offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1102 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IMAGINE that a film script - with a plot revolving around a young African-American man named Barack Obama winning a race for the White House against a white military hero - was submitted to a Hollywood studio sometime in the first decade of the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And then imagine that the Hollywood producer received, at the same time, another film script with a different story line: it would still involve a young African-American man named Barack Obama. But in the other script, Mr Obama is shot and killed during a fight with a member of a neighbourhood watch team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now ask yourself which of these two film scripts would have been regarded by Hollywood - or for that matter, by most Americans - as a realistic portrayal of the life of a young black man in America in 2002 and which of the two scripts would have been dismissed as totally far-fetched, a product of the imagination of a creative liberal writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the notion of an African-American politician occupying the White House would have probably been considered as belonging to the realm of science fiction six years before the son of an African man and a white woman did end up in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime and violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, with gun violence being the main cause of death among young African-American men, and with one in every 15 black men in jail (compared to one in every 106 white men), it would make a lot of sense to adopt a story line of a television crime show which has a young black man being killed by a law enforcer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, it won't be surprising if such an incident could find its way into a television reality show about life on the streets of a poor neighbourhood in America's inner cities, even at a time when a black man is occupying the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier expectations were that the election of the first black president would inaugurate a new &quot;post-racial era&quot; in American society. But the angry protests around the country that followed the acquittal of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges by a six-woman jury of George Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch volunteer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager named Trayvon&nbsp;Martin during a confrontation in a gated community in Florida, demonstrated that race relations remains a focal point in American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Post-racial era it was not, as &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; demonstrations were held in 100 cities and as Mr Obama himself admitted during an impromptu and unscripted appearance in the White House press room last Thursday during which he tried to implore Americans to do &quot;some soul-searching&quot; in the aftermath of the Zimmerman trial that was broadcast live on television and mesmerised the American viewing public for several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Obama, who is bi-racial, was raised as a child by his white mother, and after her death, by his white grandparents in a middle class neighbourhood in Hawaii, a state with an Asian majority population and with a very small black population. He was not exposed to the kind of poverty and street violence to which so many young blacks experience while growing up in crime-ridden mainland American cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, Mr Obama, after studying in a prestigious boarding school in California, later enrolled as a student in two of the nation's Ivy Leagues universities, Columbia and Harvard. He benefited from the kind of educational opportunities that are not available even to most white middle class kids, never mind black ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not until moving to Chicago and marrying into a black family with roots in the poor neighbourhoods in the city and working as a social organiser in those areas of Chicago, was Mr Obama exposed to the realities of the black experience in America. Indeed, while running for local office in Illinois, some of his African-American rivals suggested that Mr Obama was not a &quot;real black&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as a bi-racial public figure with strong ties to both white and black America, Mr Obama may be in position to recognise and respond to what many see as a growing disconnect between white and blacks as they reacted to the Zimmerman verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For most whites, including the six members of the Florida jury that acquitted Zimmerman, the case was not about race, but about two young men getting into a fight with one of them shooting the other during the confrontation. Mr Zimmerman, who is Hispanic and has never exhibited anti-black racial animosity (he claims to have actually dated a black woman) pleaded self-defence after being attacked by Mr Martin, saying that he feared for his life. And indeed, the trajectory of the bullet and gunpowder on Mr Martin's body seemed to support Mr Zimmerman's account that the teen was on top of him when the defendant shot and killed Mr Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as many blacks see it, the case was about race, and demonstrated that young black men are viewed more suspiciously than their peers of other races and that they tend to be the target of police profiling because of their race and clothing, including the kind of hooded sweatshirt worn by Mr Martin when he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a Washington Post-NBC News poll, eight in 10 blacks say they believed that Mr Martin's killing was not justified, a view shared by only 38 per cent of white Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his press conference, Mr Obama refrained from challenging the legal basis for Mr Zimmerman's acquittal. But after avoiding discussing race relations for most of his presidency, he insisted that he wanted to &quot;speak from the heart&quot; about the issue and referring to his experience as a black man in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store,&quot; Mr Obama said, adding: &quot;That includes me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No clear answer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the first African-American president didn't (or couldn't) provide a clear answer to his own questions. &quot;Where do we take this'&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How do we learn something from this and move in a positive direction'&quot; and &quot;Are there some concrete things that we might be able to do'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet beyond calling on the need to &quot;bolster and reinforce our African-American boys&quot;, Mr Obama seemed to admit that there was nothing concrete in terms of government policy that he could do to bridge the racial divide in American society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All he could offer was his confidence that younger generations of Americans have been making progress in changing racial attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It doesn't mean that we're in a post-racial society,&quot; he said. But there was hope, he stressed, noting that members of the generation of his two young daughters were &quot;better than we are&quot; when it comes to race relations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From July 18</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country is buzzing with talk about racial profiling since the acquittal Saturday of George Zimmerman in the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida. Here in Madison, 19-year-old Marshaun Hall says while he doesn't feel particularly unsafe as a young, African-American man, he is aware of heightened scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do feel a tension in the air that a white person might feel unsafe in my presence,&quot; Hall says. &quot;If I walk around at night, I'm cautious in what I do to make sure they feel comfortable. I shouldn't have to do that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a student at West High School, Hall helped organize a hoodie sit-in in support of Trayvon's family. Now a student at Howard University in Washington, D.C., he watched with interest for the verdict in the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was as if we didn't value Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's life enough to get a guilty verdict,&quot; Hall says, despite what he believes was the evident racial profiling involved in Zimmerman's decision to pursue a black teenager he considered &quot;suspicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication that minorities are not as valued as whites extends beyond the criminal justice system, Hall argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love Madison, but even here, there is an undertone of segregation between people,&quot; he says. &quot;I see it every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Robinson agrees, and feels the discussion about justice and race kindled by the trial is as relevant in a community like Madison, which sees itself as progressive on issues of race, as anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't see the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict as separate from other forms of racial oppression,&quot; Robinson says. &quot;We don't see the verdict as about biased jurors, although there may be some who were biased. The point is structural racism and how it is embedded in our lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson, a graduate student in sociology at UW-Madison, worked with civil rights groups Freedom Inc. and the Madison chapter of the International Socialist Organization to organize a rally and vigil around issues raised by the case. About 300 people rallied Sunday at the Capitol and about one-third that number participated in a vigil that followed at Penn Park on the city's south side, says Robinson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're trying to create a sustained, organized, community-based, grass-roots movement dealing with oppression in Dane County,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the reach of racial oppression into liberal, affluent Dane County, concern over the disparate experience of minority city residents compared to white ones has led the past two mayors to speak of &quot;two Madisons.&quot; And the mainstream advocacy organization Wisconsin Council for Children and Families this year launched the Race to Equity program to counter &quot;profound and persistent&quot; disparities in quality of life between races in Dane County, where 75 percent of African-American children live in poverty and African-American males are more than 20 times more likely to be convicted and incarcerated than white men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson said organizers of Sunday's rally and their allies are trying to humanize statistics to change perceptions. &quot;We're trying to paint a picture of life for blacks in Madison,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing has many African-American parents coping with renewed fears about their sons' safety. One columnist wrote of her anguish to protect her son from being another Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, or Amadou Diallo, or Emmett Till, tracing back nearly six decades of sensational racial killings in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall says that while his mother never tied cautions about his behavior to race, &quot;she did her best to raise me to be a man of intelligence and integrity. She pushed the importance of education and making myself presentable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sagging pants and other teenage behavior carries a bigger stigma for black kids than white ones, he says. &quot;People say they're acting black, but they're acting like teenagers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complexities of race and justice are not restricted to states in the South. Racial profiling is an issue in a Wisconsin homicide of a black teenager that many observers are comparing to the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing. A Milwaukee jury Wednesday delivered a guilty verdict in the homicide of 13-year-old Darius Simmons last year after a trial that featured a video of the fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vincent Stepney-Willis was a high school classmate of Hall's who is now a student at Lakeland College in Sheboygan. He can look back to his own experiences, like being tailed so persistently by a sales clerk in a Madison shoe store that he turned around and walked out, for evidence of the role of race in public persona. But Stepney-Willis says the intense focus on race in the Zimmerman trial obscured the fact that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was an innocent teen minding his own business when he was shot and killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stepney-Willis says he and his friends talk about race issues and work through their demeanor and accomplishments to undo bias inherent in the culture. &quot;We're trying to reconstruct those stereotypes and make a difference in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel like we are all Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; says 16-year-old Jervon Walker, a student at Middleton High School, echoing a meme that swept social media in the aftermath of the verdict. &quot;You're going to the store and you take off your hoodie so no one accuses you of stealing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother tells him to pull up his pants and mind his manners, he says, &quot;but I already know what I need to do to survive in this world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker says he thinks the discussions coming out of the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case may actually change things. &quot;Some people will learn from it. Other people who want to keep their same way will do what they want to do. But I think most people will benefit from it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is, without a doubt, many countries - or even worlds - rolled into one. That's my prominent impression after driving through KZN, Transkei, Garden Route and Cape Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this first trip to the country for a reunion of Nieman Fellows (journalists), we moved frequently between First World amenities, emerging economy-style dynamism, and the struggles of underdevelopment- all in the course of a few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mall in Scottburgh bubbled with excitement about new retail opportunities, while the malls in Cape Town had the blas&Atilde;&copy; air of trendy European capitals. We were captivated by the histories of voluntary and forced migration set against the backdrop of splendid towering mountains and the lapping oceans: you are a real meeting point for three continents - Africa, Asia and Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Americans of Indian origin, we were especially attuned to the Indian disapora in South Africa: many people looked like us, but of course sounded very different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our first stop in Durban was at the Phoenix Settlement where Mahatma Gandhi experimented with a new social order for more than a decade. South Africa is not recognised enough as the crucible for Gandhi's transformation into a political activist and thinker - it was where he spent the most vital middle 20 years of his life - and we were keen to explore it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a thrill to gaze out at the hills from the same verandah where he stood 100 years ago, plotting non-violent strategies to contest social hierarchies. It was also strangely lonesome - there were no throngs of visitors to this museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The landmarks associated with Nelson Mandela's life history were moving in entirely different ways. Our visits to Qunu's museum and Robben Island were made especially urgent knowing his fragile health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps what we most wanted to understand better was the transformation Mandela underwent from being an agitator who contested apartheid by all means necessary to an all-embracing spirit who believed in the best in everybody and wagered on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We came to understand it better by witnessing the conditions in his prison. We were moved by the tiny window through which he gazed for years on |end in his solitary cell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy of &quot;each one teaching one&quot; seemed especially heroic in the cramped conditions of the group cell, where 20 to 30 disparate people spent their evening and sleeping hours together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We imagined the many evenings spent debating ideas and strategies, sharing secret information about the outside world, and imagining a better future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was saddening to hear that Jama, a former inmate and our guide, who gave up precious years of his youth in Port Elizabeth to fight for a more just order, now had no official recognition from the government as a freedom fighter, and that he worked in this job out of economic necessity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this is understandable when a government is strapped for resources, we also know from driving through the cushy white suburbs of Durban and Cape Town that this is also a very rich country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's transition is a difficult and painful one. Perhaps the most insightful line about it came in Lara Foot's play Solomon and Marion which our host, Janet Heard, took us to on our final night: &quot;We can't keep behaving as if the Struggle had a neat beginning and a neat ending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I have to confess, that line is especially resonant having landed in the US to the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict in the Trayvon Martin manslaughter case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle for a more just world continues here as well.</SPAN></P>

Martin, a young man, was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, also young but acquitted of the shooting. Zimmerman will never lead what most would call a normal life. He'll no doubt be dodging vigilantes, gawkers and, of course, the press. He'll have to live in hiding as a hermit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the verdict was read last week, there has been marches, protests and, as usual, the vandalism that follows. I'll never understand the mentality that causes large groups to smash, grab, steal and burn. As for the protest and marches, including speeches from Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Eric Holder and our president ... it's all for the camera. The media has once again blown it out of proportion and is putting out the fire with gasoline. As long as the media fuels the crowd, it will never calm down.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Theresa Dear never wears casual clothes while making flights around the country for various speaking engagements or business trips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because if she wore tennis shoes and a jogging suit on an airplane, Dear says, she would be &quot;targeted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the racial progress that's been made in this country, Dear said racial profiling continues to happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;African-Americans and African-American men in particular are racially profiled everywhere,&quot; said Dear, who is a minister at DuPage AME Church. &quot;You walk in a store, racial profiled. You walk in a church that is not your denomination, racial profiled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before you can address that and other issues dealing with race, Dear said, there needs to be &quot;a courageous conversation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday night, members of the DuPage County branch of the NAACP hoped to jump-start that discussion by hosting a town hall-style event at Naperville's North Central College. The session titled &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot; featured a panel that included a law enforcement official, a state representative and community members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers said the meeting, which drew more than 60 people, was inspired by the reaction to the acquittal of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reaction to the Trayvon Martin case is proving that there is a major difference in how people are viewing race in America,&quot; said Mario L. Lambert II, president of the local NAACP chapter, which covers DuPage, Kane, Kendall and Will counties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lambert said the goal is to bring community leaders together to try to find solutions to the problems contributing to the racial divide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, for example, an achievement gap between white and minority students in schools across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lourdes Ferrer, an education consultant and national speaker, said Common Core standards that are being implemented nationwide are only going to make things tougher for black and Hispanic students. So education has to be priority at home, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to change the way that we see education,&quot; Ferrer said. &quot;And we have to make education a priority in our families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Linda Chapa LaVia said there needs to be a push to get more funding to provide early childhood education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once you educate a child, that child reaches the universe,&quot; she said. &quot;They go anywhere they want to as long as we can educate them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents also must be more involved in the education of their children, according to Renard Jackson, director of outreach and program development at North Central College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we need is to have parents that are more responsible,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;They can't continue to shift the responsibility away from what they need to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Naperville Deputy Police Chief John Gustin acknowledged racial profiling happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as we continue to hire police officers from the human race, you are going to end up with people who will exercise their particular prejudices and their particular intensions,&quot; Gustin said. But he said most of the police officers he knows are &quot;fine, respectful men and women who follow the law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Gustin said something needs to done to address the black-on-black crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't stop our own kids from killing each other, then this conversation is moot,&quot; Gustin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lambert said the search for solutions will continue far beyond Tuesday night. He said organizers knew one meeting wouldn't be enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're proving tonight is that we have leaders in the community who care,&quot; Lambert said. &quot;They care enough to show up and talk about issues that are important. They also care enough to be available moving forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the George Zimmerman murder trial is over, let's hope we've heard the last of the awkward term &quot;white Hispanic.&quot; For the most part, it is a media concoction that has stirrred resentment from both whites and Hispanics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whites think the media were intent on telling a tragic tale in terms of a white villain and a black victim, and so that's why they tacked on the modifier &quot;white&quot; before &quot;Hispanic.&quot; Hispanics are just as cynical. They believe that a half-white, half-Hispanic person who wins the Nobel Peace Prize will likely be referred to as &quot;white&quot; but one who kills an unarmed black youth and becomes a reviled member of society will always be called &quot;Hispanic.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to multicultural America, circa 2013, where you can't tell the players without a program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confusion started just a few days after the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting when Robert Zimmerman Sr. insisted that his son George couldn't be racist because, well, after all, he's Hispanic. Soon thereafter, Robert Jr. seconded the motion, telling reporters that his brother identified himself as &quot;Hispanic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure the Zimmermans meant well, but they tried to defend George based on the faulty assumption that Hispanics couldn't be racist. That would mean Hispanics couldn't be human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may never be sure just how authentically &quot;Hispanic&quot; George Zimmerman really is or how much he relates to the language, food and culture of his mother, who was born in Peru. Like many people with mixed cultural backgrounds, the 29-year-old was able to choose, I suspect, whether to identify more with his mother or his father, who is white and of German descent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, since the verdict, when liberals feel like slamming Zimmerman, a lot of them forget the &quot;white&quot; part and take the express train right to &quot;Hispanic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit A is Nancy Grace, the HLN talk-show host, who was upset over comments from Zimmerman attorney Mark O'Mara about how his client should be given back his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Give Zimmerman back his life?&quot; she questioned on her show. &quot;He's out on bond driving through Taco Bell every night, having a churro. You know, long story short, he's got his life. Who is going to give life back to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin? I find that, at the very least, a very poor choice of words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace's word choice was worse. Not only are her comments racist, they're also inaccurate. Zimmerman isn't Mexican. He's half-Peruvian. Guess what? Tacos and churros are not big in Peru. I don't know whether to wash out Grace's mouth or hand her an atlas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, Hispanics disapprove of his acquittal by a 2-to-1 margin, and 60 percent of Hispanics say that nonwhites do not receive equal treatment in the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that's one reason the national organizations that are supposed to defend Hispanics have, for the last year and a half, shown no interest in defending Zimmerman. A more likely reason is that groups such as the National Council of La Raza have strong relations with their African-American equivalents, and they'd like to keep it that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the dominant media narrative in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin-George Zimmerman saga is largely drawn in black and white, and that most of the commentators who were booked on cable television during the trial were either black or white, you might have thought it would be difficult for Hispanics to find an entry point into this story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No such luck. The nation's largest minority couldn't have avoided this difficult national conversation if it wanted to. And now, unfortunately, we're right in the middle of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A little girl was shot to death in Oakland on July 17 near my neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was doing nothing more than enjoying a sleepover at her best friend's house when someone shot through the front door and killer her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this mean the people of Oakland will now riot for three more days and destroy as many downtown businesses as possible, or does this one not count? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somehow, it seems really quiet around town. Someone explain the difference between this and Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headline unfairly taints guns owners</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Tammerlin Drummond column ran with the headline, &quot;Florida's gun law is biggest outrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere in her column did a gun law get mentioned. She opined on many relevant concerns about profiling, racism, vigilantism and so forth, but the only law mentioned was the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, which is not about guns, rather about a right of someone to use deadly force (knives, guns, fists, etc.) when defending themselves when they are in places they are entitled to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It does not, as argued in the column, allow a person to &quot;stalk a teenage boy who he thinks is 'up to no good,'&quot; nor does it discuss guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This letter is not defending George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a request that the editorial staff refrain from tainting gun owners and gun rights by making such ridiculous assertions as the headline suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome quite possibly would have been the same if he used a knife, broken bottle or fists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The columnist's request to &quot;strip away the hyperbole&quot; should apply to the headlines as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Must look more closely at issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author of the letter the recent letter, &quot;Progress happens only with respect,&quot; should pay some respect to the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth of the matter is that the Arabs and the Palestinians acknowledged Israel's &quot;right&quot; to exist when they unanimously accepted the Arab peace initiative proposed in 2002. This would have ended the Arab-Israeli conflict and normalized relations between the entire Arab region and Israel, in exchange for a complete withdrawal from the occupied territories. The Israeli government quickly rejected the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When one begins to pay close attention to the Palestine-Israeli issue, it becomes clear that the letter writer was simply reiterating the same sound bites and propaganda used to deceive us about a major crime taking place in our world, in all of our holy land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not a complicated issue. One only needs to visit the birthplace of Jesus in Bethlehem, now surrounded by a 26-foot concrete apartheid wall, to see the tragedy that the state of Israel is inflicting upon the indigenous population simply for being born Christian or Muslim. The irony.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students must get the basic skills</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think Oakland's summer bridge program for children is such a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a volunteer in a kindergarten classroom, there are so many basic skills I feel are necessary for students to know -- sharing, communicating, patience and many other basic skills -- to get through the first few years of school because this is a part of their foundation for life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, I have worked with students who do not understand these basic concepts and it not only makes it more difficult for the teacher, but for the student as well because they tend to feel behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine what could happen if the program was implemented in all 58 counties in California, then expanded to other states?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With such small student-to-teacher ratios and an abundance of volunteers, such as district teachers or college students studying education, this would help make sure that all children going into kindergarten are completely prepared and ready to face their first day of school.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm responding to William Hubbell's letter to the editor, &quot;Karkoc a victim of the Nazi hunters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiously, Hubbell never mentions that the organizations to which Michael Karkoc belonged were sponsored by the SS, not the regular German Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SS was responsible for the lion's share of atrocities committed by the Nazis, including the mass murder of defenseless, innocent men, women and children. Nor does he mention that the organizations that The Associated Press wrote Karkoc helped organize or belonged to did much of their sponsors' dirty work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Hubbell cynically tries to portray Karkoc as some kind of anti-communist freedom fighter. He then cleverly attempts to take our focus away from the seriousness of Karkoc's deeds by bringing our country's perceived misdeeds into view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true the United States does not have a spotless human rights record, but to equate America's history with those who perpetrated the worst genocide ever is akin to a defense attorney defending a murderer by claiming that the prosecutor, himself, has racked up two parking violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a perfidious apology and an insult to our intelligence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida verdict was about race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paraphrasing Charles Dickens: &quot;If the law supposes (George Zimmerman wasn't responsible, then) the law is a ass, a idiot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's jury found him &quot;not guilty,&quot; but racism interprets that verdict to mean &quot;innocent&quot; in Trayvon Martin's wrongful death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida has a long history of incorrectly acquitting white-on-black crime. Racism holds Martin, the victim of violence, to a higher standard of conduct than his aggressor. This court contradicted reality when purporting this trial &quot;wasn't about race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida law failed Martin -- through racially charged bias -- when an armed white adult was presumed justified in shooting an unarmed black juvenile, when it should've pondered the legal probability Martin lawfully stood his ground, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racists employ specious speculation, putting Martin on trial by presuming he &quot;started the fight&quot; and &quot;should've retreated&quot; yet ironically declare Zimmerman had no such obligation despite being implored to stand down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tangible evil triggering this tragedy is the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) promulgated, legally flawed and unequally applied sophistry called &quot;stand your ground,&quot; which enables and encourages needless violence and must be repealed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigration system of the United States is, without question, in dire need of reform, and now is the time for that reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite past opposition to such measures, the Republican Party should, and must, lead the campaign to resolve this nation's immigration challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans ought to take this charge because it is economically prudent and deeply humanistic, not because it will lead to an electoral victory in 2014. If, in the act of bettering the nation, Latino voters embrace the Republican Party, then that would be a welcome side-effect of proper governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foremost, the Republican leaders from California must again demonstrate they understand this nation, its challenges and its people. By responsibly reforming immigration policy, those men and women will do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt's crisis is the result of an outdated election system, which is even worse than our own local elections were before Berkeley, Oakland, San Leandro and San Francisco passed reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt's problems can also be solved with the same improvements: District representation and Instant Runoff (Ranked Choice) Voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;parliament&quot; proportional election system itself motivates voters to vote along sectarian lines so that their ethnic/religious group will be represented. Only with district representation and ranked voting are politicians motivated to overcome sectarian divisions and promise to focus on improving their district's future instead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win, they cannot risk alienating any ethnic group because they will need all the second- and third-choice votes they can get. This is why Oakland and San Francisco now have the first big-city Asian mayors in the United States, along with nondivisive, policy-oriented political climates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should be sharing these benefits and helping Egypt get proper voting equipment before new elections are held. This is the ideal opportunity, while Egypt has no incumbent government to resist/prevent modernization.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News that California's per-capita creation of wastes has decreased from 4.4 pounds per person per day to 4.3 pounds (June 30) in the last year masks that the population has increased by 300,000 people, so the volume of wasted materials may stay about the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State staff erroneously (in my opinion) switched to a per-capita system of measurement about six years ago that fails to show serious progress in waste reduction during a depressed economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more interesting is the behavior of some businesses and families that make ounces of waste a day through careful purchasing and careful management of their used materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight of the 10 largest cities in California have established zero waste goals, but the numbers don't show much progress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engineering colleges at UC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shankar Sastry, dean of the College of Engineering at UC Berkeley, announced his frustration at the ineffectiveness of Berkeley at fulfilling incoming students' first choice to be engineers. Bravo Sastry!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UC Berkeley's leaders misapply resources into dated programs while Sastry could instead double the number of engineering graduates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many qualified students and applicants don't even apply because of the intense competition for existing slots. Because of limited funding, it currently takes a 4.4 grade-point average to be admitted into Berkeley's vaunted engineering programs. Only valedictorians need apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sastry could readily admit another 700 students per year just as qualified, doubling the output of amazing talent, if the chancellor would demonstrate executive discipline to reallocate his existing operating budget more wisely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, many disappointed Bears take what they can get, often studying for nonexistent or poorly paying careers, while the promise of a career in engineering that they desire is lost. Meanwhile, Provost George Breslauer advocates increasing tuition -- the total yearly cost to attend approaches $35,000 -- while denying capable students their career of choice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART strike mustn't happen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting around the Bay Area when you're disabled is tough enough. Getting around the Bay Area without BART is virtually impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A simple elevator outage at BART can easily make a person in a wheelchair late to a doctor's appointment. Without BART, it means you are probably not going to make the appointment at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those of us with disabilities, BART isn't just a transit service -- it's a lifeline service. Many disabled live on limited incomes and are either incapable or cannot afford to drive. Other options, such as paratransit, are either scarce or too expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BART remains the fastest, most efficient, most reliable and most affordable transportation option for most Bay Area residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a member of several local transportation planning agencies and committees, I know how scarce transit dollars are and how hard it will be to invest back into the 40-year-old system and its employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is important that BART management and its unions reach a fair settlement before the coming Aug. 4 deadline and avoid another strike. The disabled community, and the region as a whole, is depending on it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the Trayvon Martin case teaches us three things:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't go walking after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't wear a hoody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be a person of color. (Even a dark tan is suspicious.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no IRS 'scandal'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent forum contributor's letter harped on the Internal Revenue Service &quot;scandal.&quot; He opined, &quot;Targeting a group based on their beliefs has the ring of World War II Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That claim is outrageously inappropriate, and he knows that stooping to such an obscene analogy is far worse than that. Coupling President Obama to Adolph Hitler is inexcusably despicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IRS investigation is ongoing, but premature conclusions have been offered by numerous partisans. What is known thus far is that requests for tax-exempt status by most conservative groups were processed carelessly. The bungled handling is intolerable, but what is known hardly constitutes a scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IRS's long-standing rule granted tax-exempt status only to groups that were &quot;exclusively&quot; engaged in social welfare activity. Years ago, that standard was altered to require that such groups only be &quot;primarily&quot; engaged in such activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the organizations in question aren't even superficially engaged in such charitable activity. The groups exist to prod the Republican Party further right, and they have no legal right to ask taxpayers to subsidize their partisan cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public unions and strikes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent editorial about costly public pension subsidies, the Times suggested the elected officials who continue to agree to the costly deals should be voted out of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is extremely unlikely to have different results by replacing the elected officials. The reason is that there is little difference between the majority of the voting public and the public unions. As a consequence, the public unions are negotiating with their mirror image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is needed is a ban against public employees striking, or to privatize all public supported works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this happen? Perhaps when the public unions kill the goose that laid the golden egg, but then it will be much too late.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEORGE Zimmerman, the man whose not-guilty murder verdict sparked racially charged protests across the US, last week helped rescue a family from a horrific car wreck less than a mile from where he shot Trayvon Martin dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman pulled Dana and Mark Gerstle (pictured left) and their two children from their upturned SUV last Wednesday after frantic 911 calls following the incident on a stretch of Florida highway just yards from the Seminole gated community where the Neighbourhood Watch captain shot the 17-year-old black teen in February, 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, acquitted of all counts against him on July 13, has been in hiding since the controversial finding that has ignited America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father of two Mr Gerstle, 52, was driving on to the off-ramp of the highway when he lost control of the vehicle. The crash left him, his wife and children aged eight and four trapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither he nor his 41-year-old wife chose to comment on their brush with Mr Zimmerman, who did not witness the accident occur but was on the scene shortly afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he spoke with his lawyers on Friday he did not make any mention of the rescue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shawn Vincent, a spokesman for Mr Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara said: ``We spoke with George on Friday and he made no mention of this at all. That's very typical of George. He has a history of getting involved. It's just the way he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">``There has already been the backlash of people saying this is some sort of PR stunt but it isn't. We've had it confirmed by the sheriff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford Police Department Captain Jim McAuliffe said Mr Zimmerman was identified by one of the crash victims as the man who pulled him and his family from the mangled blue Ford Explorer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The responding deputy said that when he arrived at the crash scene two men -- one of them Mr Zimmerman -- had freed the Gerstle family from their overturned vehicle. No one was hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman left after telling the deputy what had happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if Mr Zimmerman was being called a hero, Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Kim Cannaday said: ``We're not going that far.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zimmerman, his family and his lawyers have received numerous death threats. Over the weekend celebrities including Beyonce and Jay Z joined rallies to press for federal civil rights charges against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I compliment the Free Press Journal for the bold questions put to US Vice President Joe Biden. The US supports its surveillance on the internet, encompassing the entire globe, on the premise that it helps in fighting/stopping terrorism. But what about the US government supporting terrorist organisations like the Taliban earlier in Afghanistan, to throw out the then Soviet Union from that country? Can all ordinary Americans or other citizens of the world can be considered terrorists to snoop on , but not the government? Why there should be secret courts for surveillance programme,when other courts in the US are transparent in working, compared to other nations, and they also have a code of conduct for judges and judicial employees in the public domain, which is a rare commodity for many nations' courts' websites. There should have been one more question - how about prosecuting the ex-President of US ,for war crimes in Iraq, when the US itself said that Iraq did not possess nuclear weapons, but it attacked that country on those very same grounds? What about President Obama's mere paid lip service in the Trayvon Martin case? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another question should have been : Will the Navy Seal commandos hunt down the whistleblower Snowden, who is in Russia now and bring him back to the US? Will the US fighter jets intercept the aircraft carrying Snowden to Latin American countries like Venezuela and Cuba, which have offered him asylum?<BR><BR>Deendayal M Lulla</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My name is not Trayvon&nbsp;Martin; my name is Gemma Raeburn-Baynes, living for the past 50 years in Montreal. But I can relate to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and the hundreds of thousands of people around the world who were stunned, speechless and angry over the not-guilty verdict for George Zimmerman after the fatal shooting of young Trayvon in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing this with dismay because I cannot believe that we as African-Canadians or African-Americans cannot live as ordinary people - doing ordinary things like cleaning our garage or driving to work - without being racially profiled and seen as potential criminals, and ending up arrested or, like Trayvon, shot dead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As black people, it is clear to me that we do not really have full and equal citizenship. Our black skin and society's racial stereotypes make us targets and looked on as suspected criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I had my own personal experience in this respect in 2004, when cleaning out the garage of my West Island home at 11:30 in the morning with two of my friends who happened to be black men in their late 50s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of my neighbours, who was only 17 years old at the time, saw two black men in my backyard and immediately assumed they were robbing my home. So she called the police, as according to her information there had been a lot of break-ins in the neighbourhood recently. This white neighbour assumed, just as Zimmerman did, that my friends were up to no good, engaging in criminal activities. Police arrived with their guns drawn. We were all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">detained, including me, who had to prove that I was indeed in my own home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, no one was injured, at least not physically, although we were all shocked, especially in my case, since one of the officers told me, with his firearm still pointed at me, that &quot;bullets see no colour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems to me that despite all the laws that guarantee equal protection and benefit of the law for all, there is still not full and equal access to justice for people of the black race in this city and province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we took our case to the Montreal police ethics commissioner and then to the police ethics committee and then to Quebec Court, we were also confronted with inadequate access to justice,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all along the way. It was clear that decision-makers, including judges, were struggling to accept the idea of racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My friends and I had to undergo three appeals, up to Superior Court, in order to find some resolution to our case. The whole process took six years and ended in a financial settlement, the terms of which I cannot discuss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still to this day, I find myself asking questions such as: Should black people go through the justice system at all? Can we really trust the justice system to do the right thing? Are there separate rules for blacks and whites? Is our criminal justice system racially biased? How can we feel comfort and protection as ordinary people in our community,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even when we are visibly older senior citizens? What about our children and our young black men, who are statistically proven to experience disproportionately more police interventions, criminalization and unemployment? Can we trust our judiciary when, out of more than 500 federally and provincially appointed judges in Quebec, there are only two black judges? This is not normal, just as it is equally unacceptable that I and my two old black friends in the garage incident had to go through painful and costly court appeals to finally obtain justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My son was born and raised in Montreal. He is a John Molson School of Business graduate and a successful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">businessman. And yet I still worry each and every day for his safety. What happened to Trayvon could easily happen to him. He has been profiled and questioned by the police on a few occasions here in Montreal in bars and clubs, in front of his white friends who were not asked for ID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As my son often does, Trayvon was simply walking home from the store, going about his everyday life, and was profiled and intercepted by Zimmerman as a black &quot;thug&quot; up to no good. This assumption left Trayvon dead with a bullet through his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot to learn from the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin tragedy. The negative stereotypes surrounding the black male should no longer be tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As President Barack Obama stated: &quot;We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many Trayvon&nbsp;Martins right here in our city, and in our own neighbourhoods in Montreal. The peaceful demonstrations around the globe in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict showed there is a new generation of youth willing to struggle for real justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must renew our commitment to end racial injustice and to push for a world where, as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. put it 50 years ago, we are judged on the basis of the content of our character and not the colour of our skin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican congressman from Yuma, who represents the 4th District, asked Holder in the letter he wrote Tuesday to clarify his recent comments attacking Stand Your Ground Laws in light of the Trayvon Martin verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Gardner's office in a news release, Gardner's letter comes one week after Holder gave a speech that called into question self-defense provisions like Stand Your Ground Laws. In the letter, Gardner called Holder's comments &quot;highly disturbing,&quot; noting that they raised serious constitutional questions and threaten the ability of people to protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have recently claimed that there is a duty to retreat, but this is a relatively new concept which would be better called a duty to live in fear,&quot; Gardner wrote in the letter. &quot;Questioning principles like self-defense will not go unnoticed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gardner has been a leading proponent of self-defense provisions in the past. He introduced legislation that would expand the state's &quot;Make My Day Law&quot; to cover places of business in addition to homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Law-abiding citizens should not live in fear that they will be prosecuted for protecting themselves,&quot; Gardner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the letter, Gardner pushed for clarification of Holder's comments and requested assurance that the Justice Department does not intend to interfere with state self-defense provisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadhbh Walshe: Fisking ... Ray Kelly: In the frame to head Homeland Security, this week the NYPD commissioner defended his record in the Wall Street Journal <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's police commissioner Ray Kelly wrote a blistering op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this week defending the New York Police Department's &quot;proactive policing strategies&quot; as legal, constitutional and, most of all, successful in combating crime. As not everyone agrees with this stance, we thought we'd take a closer look at what the commissioner had to say in the NYPD's defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2002, the New York Police Department has taken tens of thousands of weapons off the street through proactive policing strategies. The effect this has had on the murder rate is staggering. In the 11 years before Mayor Michael Bloomberg took office, there were 13,212 murders in New York City. During the 11 years of his administration, there have been 5,849. That's 7,383 lives saved - and if history is a guide, they are largely the lives of young men of color. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murder rates in New York City have fallen, as Kelly notes, and this is a cause for celebration, but his claim that this decline is due to the &quot;proactive policing strategies&quot; that have been in place since the beginning of his and Bloomberg's periods in office is a stretch at best. In 1990, there were 2,245 homicides in New York City. By 2002, when Kelly took over, that number had already dropped nearly 75%, to 587.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the next seven years or so, until 2009, the homicide rate declined slightly - but nothing like it had over the previous decade; and it did not fall below 500 until 2009. Interestingly, the murder rate increased again in 2010 and 2011, the very years that Kelly's signature proactive policing strategy, &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot;, was at its peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly's claim that his proactive policing policies were responsible for the removal of tens of thousands of weapons from the streets is also questionable. Less than 2% of stop and frisk searches have resulted in the seizure of illegal weapons, and guns are recovered in only 0.14% of stops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far this year, murders are down 29% from the 50-year low achieved in 2012, and we've seen the fewest shootings in two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is true. There were only 414 homicides in 2012 and it is a 50-year low. Interestingly, stop-and-frisk searches also declined in 2012, which doesn't help Kelly's case that the proactive policing policies are directly linked to lower homicide rates. In fact, criminologists everywhere have not reached any consensus regarding the declining crime rates nationwide since the 1990s; they point to a complex set of socioeconomic factors, including a decline in birth rates, the gentrification of inner cities, and an end to the crack epidemic - as well as changes in policing methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To critics, none of this seems to much matter. Sidestepping the fact that these policies work, they continue to allege that massive numbers of minorities are stopped and questioned by police for no reason other than their race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uh, well, yes. People do tend to get kind of touchy when &quot;massive numbers of minorities are stopped and questioned by police&quot; and nearly nine out of 10 of them turn out to be completely innocent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind that in each of the city's 76 police precincts, the race of those stopped highly correlates to descriptions provided by victims or witnesses to crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps we should take Kelly's word for it when he says the &quot;race of those stopped highly correlates to descriptions by victims or witnesses&quot;, but in that case, there are two conclusions to be drawn. On the one hand, it speaks very highly of the NYPD that Kelly's officers have had the capacity, during the Bloomberg administration, to make street identifications of more than 4 million crime suspects for stopping, questioning and frisking. On the other hand, the fact that more than 90% of the time, these identifications turn out to be random and wrong speaks less highly of the NYPD's effectiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that in a city of 8.5m people, protected by 19,600 officers on patrol (out of a total uniformed staff of 35,000), the average number of stops we conduct is less than one per officer per week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an analysis of NYPD data by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the average number of stops per month (pdf) since 2002 is 43,400. The issue is not the absolute number of stops, however, but where they occur and whether racial profiling is involved: for instance, while black and Latino males between the ages of 14-24 account for only 4.7% of New York's population, they accounted for 41.6% of stops in 2011. Despite this, Kelly's most loyal backer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, recently opined:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to New York Civil Liberties Union, from 2002 to 2011, close to 90% of those stopped and frisked were black or Latino. That's certainly a alternative definition of &quot;minorities&quot; the mayor is using there. But back to Kelly:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial profiling is a disingenuous charge at best and an incendiary one at worst, particularly in the wake of the tragic death of Trayvon Martin. The effect is to obscure the rock-solid legal and constitutional foundation underpinning the police department's tactics and the painstaking analysis that determines how we employ them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh, cry me a river. This from the man who made the (undisputed in court) statement to Senator Eric Adams, a former police officer, that young black and Latino men were to be targeted under stop-and-frisk because &quot;he wanted to instill fear in them, that every time they leave their home they could be stopped by the police&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for that &quot;rock-solid&quot; foundation underpinning the NYPD's tactics, both its legality and constitutionality are being challenged in a federal class action lawsuit brought by the CCR on behalf of minorities who claim their rights were violated when they were stopped without cause by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2003, when the NYPD recognized that 96% of the individuals who were shot and 90% of those murdered were black and Hispanic, we concentrated our officers in those minority neighborhoods that had experienced spikes in crime. This program is called Operation Impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds perfectly reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the beginning, we've combined this strategy with a proactive policy of engagement. We stop and question individuals about whom we have reasonable suspicion. This is a widely utilized and lawful police tactic, upheld by the US Supreme Court in its 1968 decision, Terry v Ohio, and authorized by New York State Criminal Procedure Law and the New York state constitution. Every state in the country has a variant of this statute, as does federal law; it is fundamental to policing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That all sounds perfectly reasonable, too, and I'm sure Kelly would find that most people have no objection to the police stopping someone they reasonably suspect has committed a crime. It's just that when 90% of the people who are stopped turn out to be completely innocent, you can't blame us for thinking that the police are either incompetent or that any suspicion they may have had was not reasonable at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, Kelly should view this short video of a young Latino male victim of a stop-and-frisk, as it might help him to understand the public's anger over this &quot;proactive&quot; police strategy. The police involved offer no legally valid reason for the stop, threatened the kid (who was simply walking home) with a night in jail &quot;for being a fucking mutt&quot;, then threatened to break his &quot;fucking arm&quot; and punch him in the &quot;fucking face&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's understandable that someone who has done nothing wrong will be angry if he is stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the NYPD announced a series of steps to strengthen the oversight and training involved in this tactic. The number of civilian complaints in 2012 was the lowest in the past five years. That's progress - and we always strive to do better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sounds good - but it hasn't convinced US Attorney General Eric Holder that there is nearly enough oversight of the NYPD's tactic. Holder, who recently labeled the policy &quot;outrageous&quot;, wants the Department of Justice to exercise federal monitoring of New York police commissioner's favorite policing method. Most of the candidates running to succeed Bloomberg as mayor also support tougher oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar vein, our detractors contend that the NYPD engages in widespread, unwarranted spying on Muslim New Yorkers. Again, this is a sensational charge belied by the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation, the Associated Press determined that the NYPD has been sending undercover agents into Muslim communities to gather information about all aspects of their lives (where they eat, sleep, work and pray) - usually with no evidence of criminal activity whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1985, the police department has been subject to a set of rules known as the Handschu Guidelines, which were developed to protect people engaged in political protest. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, we were concerned that elements of the guidelines could interfere with our ability to investigate terrorism. In 2002, we proposed to the federal court that monitors the agreement that it be modified. The court agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is correct: the NYPD is obliged to abide by the Handschu Guidelines that restrict warrantless surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Handschu entitles police officers to attend any event that is open to the public, to view online activity that is publicly accessible and to prepare reports and assessments to help us understand the nature of the threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True. But it does not entitle officers to put an entire community under surveillance when there is little or no evidence of a threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a matter of department policy, undercover officers and confidential informants do not enter a mosque unless they are following up on a lead vetted under Handschu. Similarly, when we have attended a private event organized by a student group, we've done so on the basis of a lead or investigation reviewed and authorized in writing at the highest levels of the department, in keeping with Handschu protocol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the AP investigation, the NYPD sent paid informants into Muslim communities, routinely in the absence of any criminal threat and under orders to &quot;bait&quot; community leaders to say inflammatory things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who implies that it is unlawful for the police department to search online, visit public places or map neighborhoods has either not read, misunderstood or intentionally obfuscated the meaning of the Handschu Guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm sure Kelly would be the first to acknowledge that Handschu does not permit discriminatory surveillance that targets specific ethnicities or religious groups. A lawsuit filed last month by the ACLU and other civil rights groups alleges that this is exactly what the NYPD has been doing to Muslim communities in and around New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD has too urgent a mission and too few officers for us to waste time and resources on broad, unfocused surveillance. We have a responsibility to protect New Yorkers from violent crime or another terrorist attack - and we uphold the law in doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2012 report by ProPublica found that Kelly had drastically overstated the NYPD's counter-terrorism record: of 14 alleged plots that the NYPD claimed to have foiled, only two, perhaps three, involved a genuine, developed terrorism threat. Of the other 11, three involved a compromising level of entrapment behavior by NYPD officers; four were not given credence by other agencies (such as the FBI); and the rest turned out to amount to nothing more than chatter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a city, we have to face the reality that New York's minority communities experience a disproportionate share of violent crime. To ignore that fact, as our critics would have us do, would be a form of discrimination in itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, but exposing innocent members of those same minority communities to a disproportionate share of aggressive policing tactics is hardly the answer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry J Enten: How Americans split on the Trayvon Martin trial mirrors support for Obama. The issue for both is youth and minorities not voting <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">FULL TEXT</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why vote? It's a question often asked. Even for an election junkie, it can sometimes be difficult to know if it will really make a policy difference if we vote. Yet, the George Zimmerman trial and its aftermath offers a prime example of why voting is important. Here's why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pew Research poll released after the verdict showed that a slight plurality of those surveyed were dissatisfied with the verdict: 42% said they were not happy, while 39% said that they were satisfied. But the racial and age gaps between the two camps were wide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whites were in favor of the ruling by a 19pt margin. Blacks against it by an 81pt margin. Latinos were dissatisfied by a 33pt margin. To age: 18-29 year-olds were unhappy by a 25pt margin; 30-49 year-olds by a 11pt margin; 50-64 year-olds were happy by a 1pt margin; while 65+ year-olds approved by a 17pt margin. The general age pattern holds even when controlling for the fact that minorities tend to make a larger percentage of younger voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Nate Cohn points out, these differences look pretty much identical to the coalitions in the 2012 presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any of the changes are within the margin of error. But there is one key difference between the two. The presidential election rundown was among likely voters, while the Zimmerman data are among all adults. While the latter gives us a more accurate picture of how all Americans feel, the former enables a better idea of the possible political ramifications. After all, voters are the people politicians listen to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Pew concentrated solely on registered voters, they found that the 3pt margin between satisfied and dissatisfied flipped: 43% were satisfied, while 40% were unsatisfied. Those who are not registered to vote were against the verdict by a 19pt margin. The reason for this is that Latinos and 18-29 year-olds of all races and ethnicities are far less likely to vote. This was mirrored in the 2012 presidential election, when polls of all adults gave Obama a far wider lead among those who did not vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key difference between 2012 and the Zimmerman data is that Obama had a large enough lead to cushion himself against the fact that parts of his coalition were less likely to vote. The takeaway, then, is that if people against the Zimmerman ruling want action, then they need to register to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is especially the case in Florida. After the Zimmerman verdict, many were calling on Florida Governor Rick Scott to speak out or even act against Florida's &quot;stand your ground law&quot;. Scott refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news for those who want Scott out is that he's quite vulnerable in his 2014 re-election bid. I'd probably bet against him, though it is early days. The truth, though, is that if all voters had cast a ballot, Scott would have never become governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott won his first term in the 2010 midterms by a margin of 1.15pt. That margin would not have held under a 2008 electorate, but younger voters, as they almost always do, stayed home in the midterm election. Plugging the turnout of the 2008 election into the 2010 results would indicate that Scott's Democratic opponent, Alex Sink, probably would have won by about 1pt - had the 2010 election had 2008 turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response on &quot;stand your ground&quot; in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict from a Governor Sink would have likely been quite different than what we got from Governor Scott. She would almost certainly have been more sympathetic to the concerns of the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many other things would, of course, have been different if Florida had had Sink instead of Scott as governor since 2010. Measures to change state pensions, require drug testing for welfare recipients, cut in teacher pay, and, of course, alter the rules on early voting hours would surely have turned out differently. The response to the Trayvon Martin shooting would undoubtedly have been another instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, when someone tells you that voting doesn't make a difference, point them to Florida in general and the Zimmerman case specifically. Turnout isn't usually a game-changer, but in this case, it was - and is. A plurality of Americans are dissatisfied by the Zimmerman verdict, yet a plurality of registered voters are satisfied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people see the &quot;stand your ground&quot; law as a leading culprit in the Zimmerman acquittal and want to change it, they need to turn out and vote in 2014.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes it's good to be proved wrong. Last week, I wrote a column doubting that President Obama could speak powerfully and effectively about the racial issues raised by the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. Well, the president did just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's remarks Friday - a surprise to reporters expecting the usual daily press briefing - were brief and informal. But they amounted to the most important speech about race our first African-American president has delivered in office. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My skepticism about whether Obama should even try to say anything meaningful about Martin's death and the acquittal of his killer, George Zimmerman, had nothing to do with the president's thoughtfulness or eloquence. I simply feared that whatever he said would be misconstrued - deliberately, by some - in a way that robbed his words of their intended meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama began by talking about himself. It was disarming to hear the most powerful man in the world speak of powerlessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son,&quot; the president said. &quot;Another way of saying that is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama noted that &quot;the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,&quot; then narrowed his focus once again to the personal. I quote the next passage at length because, for me, it is the heart of the speech:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African-American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me - at least before I was a senator. There are very few African-Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure I know an African-American man who hasn't had these experiences. What's new is the idea that the president of the United States knows what it feels like to be eyed warily, to be presumed guilty of malicious intent. That gets your attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama went on to explain why, in his view, Martin's death and Zimmerman's acquittal had such tremendous impact for black Americans. African-Americans are not naive, he said; we know that young black men are &quot;disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.&quot; But it is not making excuses for bad conduct to recognize that the pathology seen in many poor black communities has a historical context. Refusing to acknowledge this context, Obama noted, &quot;adds to the frustration&quot; that many African-Americans feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws,&quot; Obama said. He might have gone further and noted that nowhere will you find citizens more supportive of tough law-and-order policies than in poor, high-crime neighborhoods. But law-abiding citizens want those policies applied fairly - and know that often they are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is &quot;a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.&quot; Here the president was guilty of understatement; most of us don't have &quot;a sense&quot; that things would be different, we'd bet the ranch on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president ended on a hopeful note - gradually, &quot;we're becoming a more perfect union&quot; - and proposed a way forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offered federal help to local law enforcement agencies in winning the trust of the communities they serve. If the help comes with federal dollars, there will be lots of takers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gently suggested that states re-examine stand your ground laws such as Florida's. &quot;If Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk?&quot; Obama asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, Obama laid out the challenge of &quot;helping young African-American men feel that they're a full part of this society and that they've got pathways and avenues to succeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the crucial, daunting challenge. Millions of at-risk boys and men need education, mentoring, employment. If this won't come through &quot;some grand, new federal program,&quot; then how? And when?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting Friday's words into action could be Obama's greatest legacy. I eagerly await his next speech on the unfinished business of race.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Bill 131 proposes to help childhood sexual abuse victims advance monetary claims against third parties by extending the statute of limitations. Although well-intended, the proposed legislation is a terrible law that is blatantly prejudicial and discriminatory against private employers and nonprofit organizations such as the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SB 131 allows victims of childhood sexual abuse more time to sue for money and has nothing to do with holding a child abuse victimizer accountable for his criminal behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SB 131 would hold one third-party employer guilty and another employer not guilty for the same behavior, and that would grant redress to one victim but not another for the same criminal victimization. This would violate the principle of equal protection under the law because it would not apply to public schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unintended consequences of SB 131 being passed and signed into law could be catastrophic. As a retired peace officer who has been involved in Scouting for over 50 years of my life, I can attest that the most effective gang prevention program in the United States is the Boy Scouts of America. BSA is a private nonprofit that happens to emphasize each Scout's religious beliefs with reverence for God. This traditional part of American culture, which molds young boys into responsible and productive young men, would be at risk if Scouting was sued out of existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private employers such as the Catholic Church also would face dire financial straits if SB 131 passes. Private church property and Christian charitable services provided to the poor, homeless and marginalized by religious institutions would be jeopardized if Christian institutions could not continue to serve their flocks because they have been bankrupted by questionable lawsuits that occurred many years ago, with evidence being destroyed and witnesses having died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a veteran law enforcement practitioner, I am surprised that SB 131 does not allow the criminal or the actual abuser to be sued. And it does nothing to increase criminal penalties against child molesters and child rapists. The reason why statutes of limitations have been part of our criminal justice system in California is because it affords due process and a speedy trial for the accused being prosecuted for a crime. The preservation of evidence and the memories of witnesses that have been destroyed or forgotten in child abuse cases would be seriously compromised under civil proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidenced by the recent George Zimmerman trial, even a year after the tragic death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin occurred, many witnesses could not precisely remember things they observed or heard in 2012. Under civil proceedings in California, the standard of evidentiary proof is significantly lowered by using a preponderance of evidence standard, or &quot;more likely than not,&quot; as opposed to &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; in a criminal trial. A church pastor or Girl Scout leader who is being accused of child sex abuse that occurred over 50 years ago could be dead and not able to testify on his/her own behalf. Such was the case with Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SB 131 would restart a process in California whereby tort attorneys would have a heyday filing frivolous lawsuits seeking large monetary damages with only cursory evidence against traditional insitutions like the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts of America. Seems to me like greed, not justice and peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law And Order: While urging the re-examination of state self-defense laws, then-state Sen. Barack Obama co-sponsored a bill nine years ago that stiffened Illinois' 1961 &quot;stand your ground&quot; law. So, he had it right the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago,&quot; the president said in his first on-camera response to the verdict exonerating neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman of the second-degree murder of Florida teen Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping at a department store, and that includes me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except very few of these men turn around and pummel the security guard or whoever is following them to the point that the individual fears death or severe bodily harm, as Florida's stand-your-ground law requires for the use of deadly force in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama omitted the salient fact brought out at trial that Martin could have simply proceeded home. He was the one who turned around to confront and assault Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We might want to examine those kinds of laws&quot; in the aftermath of this tragedy, the president said, asking us &quot;to consider if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk, and do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, Mr. President, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have simply continued home and not confronted Zimmerman, who in 2010 spent his spare time circulating fliers in Sanford, Fla.'s black neighborhoods demanding justice for Sherman Ware, an African-American who was beaten in a bar fight with the son of a Sanford police lieutenant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Illinois Review reports, state Sen. Obama co-sponsored a bill (SB 2386) in 2004 that enlarged Illinois' 1961 law by shielding the person who was attacked from being sued in civil court by perpetrators or their estates when a stand-your-ground defense is used in protecting his or her person, dwelling or other property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill passed, and it was one of those rare times Obama did not vote &quot;present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida version was not invoked by Zimmerman's defense team but was included in instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth noting that Florida's violent crime rate, which fell by 12% in the five years before the stand-your-ground law was enacted in 2005, fell by 23% in the five years afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics cite a rise in &quot;justifiable homicides,&quot; the operative word being &quot;justifiable,&quot; which is the case when victims dispatch their assailants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About a third of Florida stand-your-ground claims in fatal cases have been made by black defendants, twice the black presence in the Florida population, which was listed at 16.6% in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida blacks have used the defense successfully 55% of the time, same as the population at large and better than white defendants, according to a Daily Caller analysis of a database maintained by the Tampa Bay Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wonder if Obama or Attorney General Eric Holder is familiar with the case of Marissa Alexander of Jacksonville, a black woman who received a 20-year prison sentence in May 2012 for firing warning shots against her allegedly abusive husband. The judge rejected a defense under Florida's stand-your-ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander told police it was to escape a brutal beating by her husband, against whom she'd already taken out a protective order. For defending herself, she went to jail -- as some still wish for George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by standing her ground with a firearm, she may have saved her life, just like Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lancaster branch of the NAACP on Monday evening urged members of the community to take action with their pens and write letters to local legislators as a step toward eliminating social injustices and evoking change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 70 community members, including Lancaster Mayor Rick Gray and a panel of social justice leaders, religious leaders and attorneys, packed an all-purpose room at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Lancaster for a discussion about issues surrounding racial profiling, voter identification and stand-your-ground laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dwayne Jackson, central sectional director of the Pennsylvania NAACP branches, thanked the crowd: &quot;That lets me know there is hope,&quot; he said of those who attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-hour meeting was aimed at inspiring a community movement for change and largely dealt with topics surrounding the verdict in the Trayvon Martin case. George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of the teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our biggest thing as we have these meetings - (is) to find out what we can actually do,&quot; said Rita Smith-Wade-El, Millersville University professor and director of African-American studies. &quot;What can we do to make some changes in policy, in procedure, in laws?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Miron, racial and gender equality advocate for Lancaster YWCA, said an important step forward is understanding differences in race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I think people need to start thinking about is not how we're different, but how we should come together,&quot; Miron said. &quot;We've been separated by our differences for hundreds of years. We've been divided and separated. That's playing out today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith-Wade-El said that, moving forward, Americans should base relationships with one another on those differences, not similarities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like celebrating difference because it means I don't have to be like you for you not to see an issue with me,&quot; Smith-Wade-El said. &quot;The strength of our country is its diversity, and if we begin to minimize diversity, we will weaken our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many community members shared personal experiences of racial profiling. Gray shared a conversation he once had with a judge regarding sentencing numbers of African Americans, Latinos and whites being within the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, Judge, you're starting in the wrong place,&quot; Gray said. &quot;Start at the beginning. Who gets arrested for what? That's where you should start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miron urged attendees to &quot;register to vote and call your representative,&quot; while community philanthropist Kimyatta Williams said change starts with love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we love and teach our children love, it's then that we become a unity,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Our children are our future. Start with loving them and investing in them, and then we have a chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other suggestions for change included more education about race and activities for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Lancaster chapter, the NAACP will be holding town hall meetings nationwide to address &quot;the concerns of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local chapter said it hopes for continued participation at future gatherings here and throughout the country and offered a statement of thanks after the meeting on its Facebook page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would like to thank our panelists, moderator and community members for supporting our town hall meeting. There were many ideas exchanged and together we can move forward as a united voice.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Description: What do Tremar Boggs and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin have in common? Young black males between the ages of 15-18. Well, one is being held out as a hero (as he should) and the other was profiled as a thug and criminal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hero sped through the neighborhood watching over a part of a community and possibly saved a life or halted a possible sexual assault. Both were just enjoying their respective communities, but one was shot dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you think these scenarios are different, I say you should think again. Sorry thing about attitudes is that these incidents are interchangeable, and if Tremar was in Trayvon's place, he would be dead, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Tremar did is what community watch is about, looking after the neighborhood and, &quot;reporting&quot; crime, not causing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until communities get on the same page, the death of young black males will continue. Much of this has to do with who molds our judicial system. Take a look around the Lancaster County Courthouse, sheriff and police department's diversity, it's almost laughable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go to the courthouse and listen to testimony in court. You may be surprised how much perjury is presented and tolerated in the halls of justice, and by what side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the media does not always give true and full stories of the judicial system in our town, only the so-called juicy parts, and we know who does not benefit from that! If you don't know, please ask somebody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, President Barack Obama sought to explain the anguish of African-Americans over the not-guilty verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman for the fatal shooting of an unarmed teen, 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making a surprise appearance in the White House press room, and drawing from his own experiences, the president spoke at length about the painful assumptions that often are made about young black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke candidly about how, before he became a U.S. senator, he was followed as he shopped in department stores and heard &quot;the locks click on the doors of cars&quot; as he walked across the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that while African-Americans are not naive about the disproportionate involvement of young black males in the criminal justice system - both as victims and perpetrators - they also know the history and context for that, and are pained when that fact is used to treat their sons differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of African-American boys are painted with a broad brush,&quot; the president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the president's statements, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's parents said, in a statement, &quot;We seek a future when a child can walk down the street and not worry that others see him as dangerous because of the color of his skin or the clothes on his back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as the nation roiled over the verdict in the shooting death of one black teen, Lancaster County was celebrating the heroism of another: Temar Boggs, 15, a soon-to-be freshman at McCaskey High School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boggs was helping to move a couch for an elderly neighbor in Lancaster Township when someone asked him if he'd seen a 5-year-old girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boggs and a half-dozen of his friends joined the search for the girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determined to find her, Boggs and a friend, Chris Garcia, 13, rode bicycles around the Gable Park neighborhood in pursuit of what they suspected might be her abductor's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boggs drew close enough to the car to see a little girl inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abductor - who, according to police, later would be identified as convicted sex offender Harold Leroy Herr - looked at Boggs and Garcia, stopped his car, and pushed the little girl out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The child ran toward Boggs, and told him she needed to &quot;see my mommy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Garcia rode his bicycle, and steered the one Boggs had been riding, Boggs carried the little girl to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with this newspaper, Boggs described himself as &quot;just a normal person who did a thing that anybody else would do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is indeed, in many ways, a normal kid. He plays football and basketball and participates in track. He likes to bike and skateboard. He has a mother who said she's tried to raise him &quot;the right way ... to help others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the president observed Friday, young black males often are assumed to be threatening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The content of Temar Boggs' character is one reason - but far from the only reason - we should cease making such assumptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENTARY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1006  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people who visit Alaska see it only from cruise ships, or they fly in to Anchorage and get out to the &quot;real&quot; Alaska as soon as they can, to the more scenic grandeur of the wilderness or the prime fishing and camping spots. There, they typically rub elbows with a mostly affluent and mostly white crowd of fellow travelers and tourist industry employees and entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what I've done in previous trips. And after my 2009 visit -- during the peak of former Gov. Sarah Palin's popularity, with the state's Tea Party in ascendance -- I published a blog post about how the state's dominant political philosophy and anti-government mentality was peculiar and wrongheaded, given that it receives more per capita federal government investment than just about any other state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this summer I spent a whole week right in urban Anchorage, exploring the neighborhoods in Spenard and Mountain View, where I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s. And now I'm wondering whether that philosophy and culture really is so dominant. I was immediately struck by the increasing racial diversity of the state's only big city, which now accounts for some 40 percent of the state's total population. Alaska has always had a large and vibrant Native American population, but I saw and talked to many African immigrants, Latinos, Pacific Islanders and Middle Eastern and Asian immigrants, in relative numbers that appeared to be similar to our own Twin Cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intrigued, I checked the latest census figures and they startled me, not just for what they show about Alaska but about many other so-called &quot;red&quot; states in the western two-thirds of our national land area. The demographic shifts documented by the census suggest that over the next few decades, these states likely will be gradually shifting away from the policies and politics of hard-core conservatism, too often associated with the interest of a white majority in affluent suburbs or rural regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some of those vital statistics:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minnesota is the 13th whitest state, at 83 percent, and changing rapidly from 98 percent white just 40 years ago. Alaska is far more diverse, only the 36th whitest state, at 64 percent. Alaska has the largest Native population in the nation, at about 15 percent, but clearly other racial minorities comprise an equally large percentage. Wherever the &quot;real&quot; Alaska may be, these are real Alaskans, and this diversity is also spreading throughout rural areas of the Mountain West and the Great Plains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the states in those regions, in ascending order of minority population, with lower proportions of white residents than Minnesota: Nebraska (82 percent white), Utah (80 percent), Oregon (78 percent), Kansas (78 percent), Washington (72 percent), Colorado (70 percent), Oklahoma (68 percent), Arizona (57 percent), Nevada (54 percent) and New Mexico (40 percent). Those states with the smaller white percentages tend to be more politically competitive and less reliably conservative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's happening in Alaska politics is instructive. Despite a national image created largely by Palin's notoriety, more moderate Republicans and Democrats are competing and winning in local and state politics. One of Alaska's U.S. senators, Lisa Murkowski, is considered a moderate and defeated a very conservative challenger; the other senator, Mark Begich (directly related to the well-known Begich clan on Minnesota's Iron Range) is a moderate Democrat who won a narrow victory over the late Sen. Ted Stevens, who also was considered a moderate and a fierce fighter for federal tax dollars for Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska voters' independence and moderation have been badly underestimated by the national media, according to a commentary at alaskadispatch.com, a feisty and independent online news journal. Author Amanda Coyne, citing Gallup surveys that consistently show Alaska as one of the most moderate states politically, questions whether Alaska has &quot;always been mischaracterized as a bright red state [by] East Coasters who, when they come up from their chardonnays long enough to think about the red swaths of the country west of the Mississippi, tend to lump us all together as one. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing racial diversity is likely to enlarge this independent and moderate streak in Alaska, and in all the Western and Plains states, and will hopefully push red-state political leaders away from a philosophy that is disdainful of legitimate complaints about social injustice and economic inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the nation's more thoughtful and courageous conservatives have been arguing&nbsp; persuasively that the GOP has a severe and potentially fatal problem with communities of color, and that their policies and public relations have created lasting enmity and declining percentages of support among the fastest growing demographics. A recent New Republic article, by Sam Tanenhaus, editor of the New York Times Book Review, lays out a welter of statistics that describe a Republican &quot;whiter-shade-of-pale legislative Rotary Club&quot; in Congress and state legislatures, and &quot;not only a failure of strategy or 'outreach', but also a history of long-standing indifference, at times outright hostility, to the nation's diverse constituencies -- blacks, women, Latinos, Asians, gays. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Minnesota and in every state, the trends are widening on racial disparities in unemployment, educational attainment and practically every measure of well-being. The demand from some quarters this month for a &quot;national conversation&quot; on race, provoked by the tragic death of Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of George Zimmerman, is only a manifestation of these larger demographic and socio-economic disparities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And candidates in all parties who get out ahead of these issues with practical, good-faith solutions that begin to narrow racial and economic disparities will prevail, because people of all colors are beginning to realize it's the right thing to do.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">573  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the George Zimmerman case, U.S. views of race relations have taken a hit, and one-third of Americans say his acquittal in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin has shaken their confidence in the legal system, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey found deep divisions on the overall subject of race, along both political and racial lines, as controversy over the verdict has swirled from city street corners to the Oval Office. <BR>Fifty-two percent of adults questioned said race relations in the U.S. are &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;fairly good,&quot; down from more than 70 percent who said that in NBC/WSJ polls between 2009 and 2011. <BR>Fifty-four percent agree with the statement that America is a nation where people are not judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character - down from 60 percent in 2009 and 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>That question was a reference to one of the most famous lines from Martin Luther King's &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech, delivered 50 years ago next month. <BR>The poll was conducted after a Florida jury found Zimmerman, 29, who is of white and of Hispanic descent, not guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin, 17, who was black. Zimmerman said he shot Martin, who was unarmed, in self-defense and his lawyers have said race played no role. <BR>The case sparked debate over racial profiling and Stand Your Ground laws. After the verdict, protests sprang up several major cities and a group of clergy led by the Rev. Al Sharpton held vigils at federal building to demand the Justice Department ramp up a civil-rights investigation. <BR>(Sharpton is the head of the National Action Network civil rights advocacy group and also hosts &quot;Politics Nation&quot; on MSNBC.) <BR>Last week, President Barack Obama held a surprise press conference on the case in which he said African-Americans were viewing the verdict through the prism of being judged by their skin color. <BR>&quot;Those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,&quot; he said. <BR>Although some of the polling subjects were questioned before Obama declared that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago,&quot; the data reflected the racial divide he spoke about. <BR>Just 19 percent of African-Americans and 46 percent of Democrats think Americans are judged by the content of their character rather than by their skin color. <BR>By comparison, 54 percent of Latinos, 59 percent of whites and 65 percent of Republicans believe this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty-eight percent of African Americans say that race relations in the U.S. are good - versus 52 percent of whites and 60 percent of Latinos. <BR>Asked directly about the Zimmerman trial, 32 percent of all adults say it decreased their confidence in the U.S. legal system, 17 percent say it increased their confidence and 48 percent say it had no effect. <BR>Those numbers once again show a gap by race and party: 71 percent of African-Americans and 48 percent of Democrats say the trial decreased their confidence in the legal system -- compared to 35 percent of Latinos, 24 percent of whites and just 13 percent of Republicans. <BR>&quot;This is about as polarizing as it gets,&quot; says Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who helped conduct the poll with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. <BR>The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted July 17-21 of 1,000 adults (including 300 cell phone-only respondents), and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's another face appearing on protest signs and pamphlets at Trayvon&nbsp;Martin rallies across the country. <BR>The story of Marissa Alexander, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, is gaining national attention through online petitions, social media and protests in the aftermath of the George Zimmerman acquittal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 32-year-old mother of three from Jacksonville fired what she says was a warning shot at a wall during an argument with her husband, Rico Gray, in 2010. Gray was not wounded. <BR>Alexander had a protective order against her husband at the time because he had beaten her in the past. She had no criminal record. <BR>Her lawyers tried to get the case dismissed before trial under Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, but the court rejected the argument, saying Alexander fired out of anger, not fear for her life. <BR>More than 20 states have &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, which generally allow the use of lethal force for self-defense without the duty of trying to escape. <BR>Alexander's lawyers have filed an appeal of her 2012 conviction. <BR>The Rev. Jesse Jackson met with Alexander for an hour on July 16 and phoned Florida State Attorney Angela Corey to discuss Alexander's charge and sentence. <BR>Corey, who prosecuted Alexander and also filed second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, answered Jackson's questions about the prison sentence and reiterated the prosecution's case, said Jackelyn Barnard, the director of communications for the Florida State Attorney's Office. <BR>The same day, Attorney General Eric Holder questioned &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws in a speech to the NAACP. <BR>The Zimmerman and Alexander cases illustrate how &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws are applied unfairly to racial minorities in the U.S. legal system, said Janaye Ingram, the Washington, D.C., bureau chief of Al Sharpton's National Action Network, at a vigil for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin on Saturday. <BR>Although Zimmerman's defense team didn't use a &quot;stand your ground&quot; defense in his trial, the case has prompted discussion about racial profiling and self-defense. <BR>&quot;Marissa Alexander can fire a warning shot after documented cases of domestic violence and get 20 years,&quot; Ingram said. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin can be killed for doing nothing wrong, and his killer goes free.&quot; <BR>Florida Assistant State Attorney Richard Mantei told USA TODAY that much of the discussion about the Alexander case is inaccurate - and social media are partly to blame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's fueling the particular attention is a false narrative that's getting repeated as if it's actually true,&quot; he said. <BR>Mantei said Alexander rejected a plea deal that would have gotten her only three years in prison. Instead, she decided to go to trial and was sentenced to 20 years under a Florida minimum-sentencing law regarding the use of firearms. <BR>He said Alexander pointed her gun in the direction of Gray and his two children, who feared for their lives, fled the house and immediately called 911. The bullet came close to hitting Gray's head, the documents say. <BR>Alexander's face was seen on protest signs and pamphlets at vigils for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin across the country Saturday. Rallies calling for Alexander's conviction to be overturned have been held in Oakland and Jacksonville. Petitions on change.org, whitehouse.gov, moveon.org and thepetitionsite.org have thousands of signatures. <BR>A Facebook page titled &quot;Stand Your Ground: Justice for Marissa Alexander&quot; has gotten more than 22,000 &quot;likes&quot; since April 2012. <BR>&quot;I think people thought it was an injustice from the beginning,&quot; Kevin Cobbin, the attorney who defended Alexander at her trial, told USA TODAY. &quot;People are hearing about it more and seeing some of the other things that are happening in the legal system, and it just does not make sense.&quot; <BR>Prosecutors say Alexander may not have feared for her life at the time. Rather than fleeing, she went to the garage to get her gun. <BR>While she was free on bail, another altercation between the two left Gray with a bloody, swollen eye, according to court documents. Alexander told police that Gray had struck her and that the top of her head was swollen, but she had no visible injuries, a police report said. <BR>&quot;I understand all the attention 'stand your ground' laws are getting, but this is a particularly lousy example to choose,&quot; Mantei said, noting that the jury found Alexander guilty after less than 15 minutes of deliberation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is so upsetting to me. After years of encouraging commuters to get out of their cars and take public transportation, the ferry system has succeeded beyond its wildest dreams. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while for years the district has seen ridership of the ferries grow, officials have done virtually nothing to address the parking issue that has been a product of the ferry ridership success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, they have figured that charging a parking fee will help solve this problem. They have determined that with a parking fee of this magnitude, it will encourage people to find other means of getting to the ferry terminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What other means are they thinking about? They have eliminated all of the feeder buses that were once available to get riders to the ferry terminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are now talking about introducing pilot shuttle from from downtown Fairfax to the ferry. That is all well and good, but where are the riders going to park in downtown Fairfax to take this shuttle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what about the many other areas that people travel from to take the ferry like Novato, Terra Linda, Peacock Gap, Corte Madera, etc.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obvious solution to the parking problem is a multilevel parking facility at the ferry site. This is something that should have been addressed years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A parking fee of the magnitude that the bridge district is proposing, will only cause to discourage commuters from taking the ferry, not encourage them to do so. The parking fee will not solve the parking problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations with the Marin County Mart and the Ross Valley Sanitary District to provide additional parking is a step in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the correct ultimate solution is a multilevel parking facility on site. The sooner that the district gets moving on this, the better.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affordable housing for the wealthy can be up to 43 units on 110 acres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I await with interest the vociferous protests against such low-density housing, considering the inevitable population growth and the need for more overall housing space.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama uses the Trayvon Martin verdict to speak about the racial injustice against black men &quot;that doesn't go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He bemoans the supposed &quot;nervous stares&quot; and &quot;car locks clicking when they walk down the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reminds me of when the newly elected President Obama moved to Washington in 2008, and he and Michelle immediately sent their two daughters to a cushy private school   and in doing so, turned their backs with a nervous stare on the inner city, largely black, Washington D.C. public school system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON _ Tracy Martin, the father of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, appeared on Capitol Hill Wednesday, saying he saw an opportunity for a positive outcome from his son's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People tell you that no positive can come out of death, but I disagree wholeheartedly,&quot; Martin said. &quot;Because it is what we can do tomorrow as a nation, as a people, to stop someone else's child from being killed. That's certainly a positive.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin was speaking at the first hearing of the Congressional Caucus of Black Men and Boys, a group started to discuss how society can fix issues that disproportionately affect African-American males, such as racial profiling, employment opportunities and the quality of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, a 17-year-old unarmed black male, was killed in February 2012 in Sanford, Fla., while walking home from a store. The gunman, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, was acquitted this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers repeatedly brought up amending or repealing &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws such as the one in Florida, which allows the use of deadly force if a person believes it is necessary to avoid death or serious injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe there should be an amendment to the stand your ground law that simply says you cannot be the initial aggressor,&quot; said Benjamin Crump, the Martins' attorney. &quot;You cannot start the confrontation. You cannot pick the fight, and then shoot the person, put your hands in the air and say, 'I was standing my ground.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Martin and Crump, the discussion included Michael Eric Dyson, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, and Kweisi Mfume, a former president of the NAACP and former Maryland congressman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, cited statistics on the importance of early education, including that children in third grade who are reading below their grade level are six times less likely to graduate high school. At age 5, Johns said, 56 percent of low-income black children are not prepared for kindergarten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Access to high-quality early education, for African-American boys especially, can be the difference between a pathway that leads to the White House and one that leads to the jailhouse,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee room was packed with men in suits and others in jeans and baseball caps, part of a demographic the group was specifically trying to address. Though timely because the hearing was held less than two weeks after Zimmerman was found not guilty in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's killing, the caucus was started back in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference last week to talk about the Zimmerman verdict, President Barack Obama called for the re-evaluation of laws on local levels to ensure they don't disadvantage African-Americans, as well as for conversations like the one Wednesday on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama also expressed doubts that political conversations were the way to get results, saying they often ended up &quot;stilted and politicized.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Micro-housing way to go</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 20 Herald proclaims&quot;Home prices up, inventory down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not good news for us or our maturing youth who are in a bind due to lack of earnings to meet local rents. Some double up in housing or live in their cars and vans for a while. They may have to leave the area and this results in a loss of community and quality of life for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zoning change could allow smaller, more affordable, environment friendly &quot;micro-houses.&quot; Four micro-houses would fit on a lot originally planned for one older-style house. In some areas, micro-house villages at the edge of town would be a way to grow our communities. With mini-garden plots and moped pathways alongside bike and hiking paths, it could be a very attractive alternative to more million-dollar houses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Wilson<BR>Monterey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">End racial bickering over Zimmerman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish people would end their bickering over the race issue involving the George Zimmerman trial. It is destructive to social cohesion and damages race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, one side in the debate wants to gain political brownie points. They need to sit down and look at the facts concerning race. Zimmerman is not only half-Hispanic, but has black family members (Afro-Peruvian roots), some who have lived with him. He is a registered Democrat who voted and campaigned for President Barack Obama. Zimmerman has mentored underprivileged black children, dated and took a black girl to the prom. He partnered with a black in an insurance company venture in Florida. He even organized a campaign to assist a homeless black man who was beaten by a white bully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what is all the fuss about race? I think some people are trying to use race for their own personal advantage, to gain moral and financial support for their causes. They somehow feel justified in overlooking the facts to get what they want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, their actions are stirring up racial tensions and disharmony. This is the real tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence Samuels<BR>Carmel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it's time to outlaw hoodies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So many mistakes were made in the Trayvon Martin case on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reading of thedemonstration in Seaside on July 20 about some demonstrators wearing black hoodies, as was Martin, it made me stop and think that maybe we should enact a law making the sale and wearing of black hoodies illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost every crime that you read about anymore, especially in Salinas, the suspect was wearing a black hoodie. The crime rate across the nation would probably drop and young men like Martin might not look quite as suspicious, regardless of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Egbert<BR>Seaside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Might be better to pay the fine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am confused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am of mixed heritage. My grandfather was Hispanic from Puerto Rico. My grandmother looked Chinese but said she descended from African slaves. My mother was from Queens and was definitely Jewish, and my dad was Germanic or maybe French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you look at me, you can't tell what race I am. Some people think I actually look Arabic until they see my last name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My question is this: If I am stopped by the police for going over the speed limit, what are my options? Can I claim racial profiling? If so, what race am I? Should I call the American Civil Liberties Union, the Anti-Defamation League, the United Arabic Federation, the NAACP or League of United Latin American Citizens?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or should I just pay the speeding ticket?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Marquart<BR>Pacific Grove</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman shouldn't have gotten off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't matter whether George Zimmerman is a Catholic or a Jew or a Zoroastrian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He chased down an innocent kid and killed him for no reason that you would accept if that had been your kid. And the law let him off scot-free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That needs to be fixed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is time,&quot;writes Jim Leinenkugel on July 21 , &quot;for Congress and the administration to get out of the way and eliminate the bureaucratic stranglehold they place on our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strangleholds are unpleasant. Fortunately, though, this one would seem to lack muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second quarter of 2013, the nation's six largest banks reported profits of $27 billion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misconceptions about Stevenson's stay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your otherwise nicely presentedJuly 21 supplement &quot;Living Here&quot; contains one glaring piece of misinformation: the long-discredited claim that Robert Louis Stevenson began writing &quot;Treasure Island&quot; during his stay here in 1879. It simply isn't true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austin Strong, Stevenson's stepgrandson, became so irritated by the issue that he penned a strongly-worded letter to state parks in the 1940s, demanding its people stop making the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, interpreters and docents for state parks are excellent sources for accurate, reliable information about all things Stevenson, including how he came to write &quot;Treasure Island.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a fascinating story, but it took place well after he left Monterey.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood Boulevard is the West Coast equivalent of Times Square, an urban reclamation project that transformed a strip once notorious for crime, drug-dealing and prostitution into a tourist destination, a thriving night-life district and the home of movie premieres and the Academy Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But over the past month, two high-profile crimes -- a fatal stabbing of a woman by a homeless person and a robbery spree by a gang that bounded past people gawking at the Walk of Fame -- have threatened this carefully cultivated and civically critical reinvention, worrying community leaders and presenting an early challenge to this city's new mayor, Eric Garcetti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On paper, at least, Hollywood Boulevard -- with the TCL Chinese Theater, famous star-studded sidewalks, and open-top tour vans filled with out-of-towners on what is, frankly, a mostly futile hunt for celebrity sightings -- is as safe as ever. Reports of major crimes are down 17 percent over the past year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in this case, perceptions matter. And Hollywood visitors who already might have been disconcerted by the sidewalk hustlers dressed up as Spiderman and Capt. Jack Sparrow, the wandering homeless people and the occasional boulevard fistfight have certainly taken notice of back-to-back crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I called the Chamber of Commerce and said, 'Is it safe?' '' said Greg Pack, who was visiting from Florida, as he stood in front of Madame Tussauds Hollywood. ''He said: 'Yeah, it's safe. This is an isolated incident. It happens in every big town.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We were a little concerned when we saw on the local news last night that there was rioting here,'' Mr. Pack continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pack was not alone. Los Angeles, aware of how critical this strip of the city is to its international image and flow of tourism dollars, has moved to try to deal with the problem, real or imagined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The size of the police force assigned to the Hollywood Entertainment District has increased to 60 from 40. In contrast with a few months ago -- when it was possible to walk from one edge of Hollywood to the other without seeing a uniformed police officer -- there were officers on foot, in patrol cars and on horseback the other day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City officials are talking about imposing new measures on Hollywood Boulevard, including state legislation to bar street performers from wearing masks on heavily trafficked blocks in Hollywood. The police are also talking about seeking more stay-away orders directed at people involved in crimes or episodes of harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''When something like this happens, it's a matter of concern -- especially having two events so close together,'' said Leron Gubler, the president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. ''It sends out a message that alarms some people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Garcetti, who used to represent this neighborhood when he was a member of the City Council, went to the Loteria Grill on Hollywood Boulevard for a show-of-support dinner the night after the robbery spree, joined by the police chief, Charlie Beck, and two members of the City Council. Mr. Garcetti posted a photo of the dinner, showing him, Mr. Beck and the new Hollywood councilman, Mitch O'Farrell, on his Twitter account, @LAMayorsOffice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor, in an interview, described the two episodes as ''tragic events,'' but said they did not signal any change in fortunes for the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Crime is down in Hollywood -- it is extremely safe statistically,'' he said. ''Isolated events can blow up in the media, because it's Hollywood.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''For every one bad story about Hollywood, there are probably 10,000 stories about celebrities being out, music being made, movies being made,'' he said. ''That's the steady drumbeat that attracts people to Hollywood. That's always going to be 100 times louder than any one episode, especially after the improvements that we've made.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The robbery spree appeared to be spontaneous, fanned by social media and involving a gang of up to 30 youths, ages 14 to 18, who thought the police would be distracted by a demonstration in the Crenshaw neighborhood in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin shooting. Twelve people were arrested after they roared down the streets, stealing jewelry and cellphones, and knocking people down. There were no serious injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks had added resonance because they came after the stabbing of a 23-year-old woman last month by a homeless man who demanded that she pay him $1 after taking his photograph, according to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Anytime something happens in Hollywood -- since it's such an iconic place -- it becomes magnified,'' said Cmdr. Andrew J. Smith of the Los Angeles Police Department. ''My parents heard about this incident back in Michigan. It goes everywhere.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commander Smith pointed to statistics showing how drastically crime had fallen across the city, particularly in Hollywood. ''If this incident happened three miles away, no one would pay attention to it,'' he said. ''The fact that it happened in Hollywood brings a spotlight to it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. O'Farrell said he did not think the two episodes hinted at any backsliding in the campaign to turn Hollywood around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People are pretty sophisticated, and they realize we are a big city and things happen in big cities,'' he said. ''Our crime rate has been reduced by half in the last 10 years. These are isolated incidents -- mind you they are 30 days apart -- but they are isolated incidents.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I want to say to L.A. and the world that the police presence is very strong and it's a very safe place to visit,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By any measure, Hollywood is a far cry from what it was even 10 years ago. The prostitutes and street drug vending are mostly gone, the boulevard is well lighted at night and established businesses have replaced some of the head shops and pornography stores that once dominated the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, Hollywood Boulevard still can be unsettling, and fights and shootings have broken out after clubs in the area began closing after midnight. Tourists have to compete for sidewalk space with hustlers and hawkers who see the tourists as something of a business opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've walked about a mile and everyone is trying to sell you bus tours and CDs and everything else,'' said Chris Jones, 42, here from Wyoming with his wife and three children. ''I kind of feel unsafe for the kids. There's a lot of people. A lot of bumping into you walking, trying to sell you stuff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerry Morrison, the head of the Hollywood business improvement district, acknowledged that the street characters ''have been an issue for years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It kind of creates a feeling like walking a gantlet,'' she said. ''I know you've had similar things in New York.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, she said, she was pleased by how aggressively the city had responded to the problem, and said she viewed it as a good sign for the new administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I'd be more worried if there wasn't such a tremendous response from our city leaders,'' she said. ''I think it is actually safer out there now than a year ago. You can see the police presence, you can feel it. People are extremely encouraged by that.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Issue: Rev. Al Sharpton's role in a range of racial issues, including the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hats off to Jonah Goldberg for stating the truth about Rev. Al Sharpton, something most of the media and politicians are afraid to do (&quot;The Rev's Racket,&quot; PostOpinion, July 20).   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharpton has never been anything more than a race-baiting, trouble-making, tax-evading shakedown artist and a buffoon. Sharpton has made a lucrative business of inflaming racial tensions and capitalizing on tragedies to support his extravagant lifestyle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If he were held accountable for his actions, he would cry racism, which politicians are afraid of.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The only question that he should be asked by the media is: &quot;How's Tawana Brawley?&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How does Sharpton continue to get away with it? Between Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, there will never be racial accord in this country. They put organized crime to shame, and no one will take them on. Frank Giffone </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Manhattan </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thanks to Goldberg for reminding us of Sharpton's shamelessness.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Goldberg recounts the horrific Brawley hoax, in which he fanned the flames of racism in a situation built entirely on lies. The Crown Heights riots of 1991 were also nurtured and encouraged by Sharpton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The anti-Semitic hatred that he generated after Gavin Cato's accidental death helped lead to the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rather than being castigated and perhaps imprisoned for his racist rants and incitements, Sharpton is now the host of an MSNBC show and enjoys his &quot;partnership&quot; with Eric Holder.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shame on a society that celebrates such a depraved character.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sharpton's leadership in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin demonstrations is to be expected. He is enabled by a society that has lost its values.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent meeting of the Volusia County Tourist Development Council included the Daytona Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau's chief executive applauding the new &quot;Seize the Daytona&quot; ad campaign. However, the effort has been described by The News-Journal's opinion page editor as &quot;bland and puzzling.&quot; Two county business leaders offered that the ad campaign &quot;stinks,&quot; and that many people who see the message on the billboards &quot;just don't get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marketing director of the Ocean Center presented the Ocean Center sales kit and video, which feature inanimate sidewalks, hallways, arena, classrooms, etc. The visual image appears to emphasize a beautiful, cavernous, empty building. Is this not the core problem with the Ocean Center -- too much empty space? For a dramatic comparison, one should view the attention-capturing, action- packed San Diego Convention Center's &quot;stay for the vacation&quot; video (best viewed on full screen) and interactive floor plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real gem can be found on the Ocean Center video website, where voice-over copy boasts that the arena hosts everything, including &quot;menacing machinery&quot; -- and utilizes a photo of a shiny fire truck. The vehicle that children still wave at and crave to climb on, and carries our first responders, is &quot;menacing machinery?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Main Street Pier/Daytona Beach website still features a full- page photo spread of the iconic Space Needle observation tower ride, which was dismantled in September 2012. Visitors are also encouraged to consider riding in a Sky Lift gondola, also removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pier/tower photo is also included in the new Ocean Center sales kit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distinguished, brand-building work? Indeed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A beach-loving neighbor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am writing in response to the proposed beach toll increase for non-Volusia County residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been traveling from Seminole County to Volusia County every Saturday (weather permitting) to enjoy &quot;The World's Most Famous Beach&quot; for more Than 15 years. Each year, I have purchased a beach pass that I certainly get my money's worth from (though it almost didn't happen in 2004).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I not only support the beach vendors, but also the restaurants and gas stations nearby. It costs me about $30 round trip to travel to Daytona Beach each week. My seasonal beach pass, which is paid for one time at the beginning of the season, is one less expense to consider when I pack my car each week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand that you may want to increase beach tolls some day, but please do it for the right reasons. Please don't forget about us day trippers who are very willing to come to your area and spend money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty dollars is a good cost for a non-resident pass. Please remember that those of us who live further than half a mile from the beach are not even guaranteed a parking spot on a ramp or beach after driving an hour and spending $30 in gas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change Florida's gun law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My view is that George Zimmerman's reckless aggression, in spite of a 911 operator's advice to &quot;back off,&quot; precipitated the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed young man with Skittles and some iced tea. This reprehensible act makes George Zimmerman responsible for manslaughter, at the least, from a moral perspective in my mind. All other issues in this case are subordinated to Zimmerman's unwarranted aggression, the way I see it. How tragic -- the unjust death of a young man, and that the killer is not held accountable, being acquitted by a jury of only six and not 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, so unfortunately perpetrated by the gun lobby and in place in almost half of our states, cries out for change, if not elimination, by morally-minded justice- seekers. Without appropriate change or even deletion, morally-based justice in Florida cannot be a reality. It makes me think of myself not as Floridian in the best sense, but merely as a resident, and not a proud one at that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERRY A.VALCIK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ormond Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Respect jury verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman certainly should not have followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. He should have waited for the police. But he didn't. He was concerned because he saw a young black man in a hoodie. He did not see the baby-faced boy whose picture has been shown repeatedly. What he saw was a grown man, taller and stronger than himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He saw what looked like the image portrayed to us by many &quot;gangsta&quot; rappers and adherents to the &quot;thug&quot; lifestyle. So it is understandable why Zimmerman was concerned. Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's appearance and dress fit a criminal stereotype. But like many other mistaken impressions, he was not involved in any crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence seen by the jury showed that Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was on top of Zimmerman, beating him. Ask yourself what you would do if you were in Zimmerman's position?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury answered that question. Zimmerman was found not guilty. He acted in self-defense, the God-given right of self-preservation that all creatures will exercise when their life and well-being is threatened. There was no evidence of any racial biases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus, who claim to decry injustice, have gotten 1 million signatures urging the Department of Justice to charge Zimmerman with civil rights violations -- and put him in prison for an act of lawful self- defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a tragedy that a young man died. My heart goes out to his family. There are no winners in this. But this attempted lynching by groups that claim to be interested only in justice is nothing short of an outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes this especially despicable is that it is being lead by men of God like the &quot;most right reverends&quot; Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and our own Rev. Ronald Durham.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law was misapplied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-Americans are not the only ones appalled at the Zimmerman verdict. From the TV news and news programs, you would assume they are the only ones who care about justice and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes me angry to see anyone that willfully takes another's life and then be exonerated. The &quot;stand your ground&quot; law is not the problem -- it is a good law, but the courts allow it when it is not applicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instigating a confrontation, then killing someone, is not &quot;stand your ground.&quot; To correct the problem, give the jurors a booklet of instructions about the crime, listing a myriad of exceptions, possibilities and hypotheticals to read before reaching a verdict. People of any color, looking for justice from our courts, are disappointed and angry when they see killers go unpunished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time to seek harmony</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state v. George Zimmerman trial ended over a week ago. The jury deliberated for 16 hours, unanimously reaching a not-guilty verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, a man died. That was the biggest tragedy of this whole episode. Perhaps George Zimmerman should have not followed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. Perhaps Martin should have gone home, rather than stay in the area. A number of variables could have prevented this. However, other options were chosen. Zimmerman had his day in court, and we must all respect the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However many people disagree with the verdict. The trial is over, Zimmerman is a free man, and there are still rallies and marches, and speeches by both political and non-political individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where was the outrage when O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of butchering his wife and a friend?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, rallies are scheduled. Some are peaceful, some are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would have rallied against the O. J. Simpson verdict, but I had a job and had an obligation to go to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is a racial rally without &quot;Reverends&quot; Sharpton and Jackson? These two only add fire to the issues when they get involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the U.S. attorney general wants to rewrite the law. Just like his mentor, Barack Obama, who continues to rewrite the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to pray for Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and racial harmony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Obama administration supported Texas in race-based university admissions. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama has thoughtfully asked us all to ask ourselves, &quot;Am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can? Am I judging people, as much as I can, based not on the color of their skin but the content of their character?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this spring, however, the Supreme Court heard a case involving a woman who was judged not on the content of her character, but on the color of her skin, in being denied admission to the University of Texas. The Obama Justice Department argued that this was permissible. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Texas had used a system that explicitly favored under-represented racial minorities. When that system was struck down by a court, Texas adopted a law that gave the top 10 percent of every Texas high school class admission to a state university. That policy actually increased the numbers of black and Hispanic students entering Texas universities over the previous explicit use of race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state thought the numbers were still not high enough, however. Giving opportunity on the basis of being poor, or first in one's family to go to college, or coming from a rural, less-developed part of the state, were all insufficient to obtain what the state wanted: that the count of students by race hit a certain number. After an intervening Supreme Court case involving Michigan, Texas went back to using race, and that was the case just decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's call for race-neutrality cannot be reconciled with the actual practice of race-favoritism in higher education, which he also appears to favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a university admits students or hires faculty based on race, it sends a lesson that students can't help but observe. A white student, at a university where I previously taught, once told me that another student was &quot;one of the brightest African American students here.&quot; Acculturated by his education in an elite college, that white student emerged with the stereotype that a minority-race student was there only by special concession from usual standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another casualty involves parents of students rejected for admission, some with near-perfect SAT scores and high school GPAs. It is difficult for some parents not to develop attitudes of resentment, believing that their daughter or son would have been admitted but for her or his race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against these consequences that are damaging to creation of a race-neutral society, proponents of race-conscious university admissions and hiring who are prepared to speak candidly of what they are doing (as opposed to hiding it under supposedly race-neutral policies) argue that we have to use race now to eventually achieve a society that is no longer race-conscious. What they miss is that the government cannot, consistent with the Constitution, deny an individual the equal protection of the law based on that individual's race, however laudable the societal goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tell the white or Asian student who is not admitted to a UC campus, but would have been admitted if she were black or Hispanic, that this is permissible because California has a greater goal in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1973, Justice William O. Douglas, one of the most liberal Supreme Court justices in history, wrote that the Constitution &quot;commands the elimination of racial barriers, not their creation in order to satisfy our theory as to how society ought to be organized.&quot; A university applicant &quot;who is white is entitled to no advantage by reason of that fact; nor is he subject to any disability, no matter what his race or color. Whatever his race, he had a constitutional right to have his application considered on its individual merits in a racially neutral manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court suggested it would be very difficult for Texas to continue its current approach to admissions. The day may yet come when the law of the land is, indeed, what Martin Luther King, Jr. paraphrased by President Obama, said it should be: &quot;I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting followed numerous nationwide protests regarding the Zimmerman verdict, including a July 16 candlelight vigil for Trayvon Martin in Santa Ana and a July 21 march in Anaheim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't do anything about what's already happened,&quot; said Donald Craig, president of Orange County's NAACP branch. &quot;But we need to look ahead to some of the laws in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following short speeches by a panel of ministers, political leaders and members of the county's legal community, those in the audience were encouraged to share their opinions and thoughts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the more than one dozen people who spoke, some shared personal experiences of being racially profiled and some offered solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to get back to making a difference like the generation before us,&quot; said AJ Sanders, a 45-year-old Laguna Beach woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanders said she was offended after she said her neighbors put up &quot;Keep Out'' signs between their homes once they noticed she was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's stop being afraid of one another and instead talk to each other,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters in their second week sitting in at Gov. Rick Scott's office said Tuesday they plan to hold a mock special session to heighten attention on issues affecting minority youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also are turning up pressure on Scott, who has refused their demand to reconvene lawmakers. Beginning next week, organizers said &quot;Takeover Tuesdays&quot; will be held at the Florida Capitol, featuring guest speakers and special discussion sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The governor has told us that he loves people. We want to give him a lot of people,&quot; said Phillip Agnew, executive director of Dream Defenders, the grass-roots organization leading the protest that grew out of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he has done most of the time since the protest began last week, Scott was traveling away from the Capitol, meeting with mayors Tuesday in West Palm Beach. Asked by The Palm Beach Post if he was ducking demonstrators, Scott said, &quot;no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, I cover the state, I travel the state. I'm there (in Tallahassee) more during the session,&quot; Scott said outside the Palm Beach Cafe after a meeting with mayors Jeri Muoio of West Palm Beach, Bert Premuroso of Palm Beach Gardens and Pam Triolo of Lake Worth and Deputy Mayor Susan Haynie of Boca Raton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked when he expects to be back in his Tallahassee office, Scott said, &quot;Probably next week sometime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The few dozen protesters, whose numbers have climbed to about 100 some days, said they plan to be waiting when he returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agnew said leaders have spoken via Skype with activists in Raleigh, N.C., where &quot;Moral Mondays&quot; have been held for more than two months by hundreds of protesters opposing that state's Republican-led legislative agenda, which includes an expansion of education privatization and a new voter ID law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP leaders have tried to ignore the North Carolina protesters, who have gathered outside the Legislature's chambers all but one day since April 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Scott and Florida leaders say they have no plans to disrupt the Capitol protest, in North Carolina more than 900 people have been arrested at demonstrations over the past 10 weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agnew said activists Tuesday were making plans to apply for necessary permits to hold the larger &quot;Takeover Tuesday&quot; events and mock legislative session on Capitol grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dream Defenders also is applying with the state's Department of Agriculture, allowing them to be a &quot;solicitor of contributions&quot; to help raise money for food, transportation and other costs tied to the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Florida Department of Law Enforcement reported that, through Monday, security costs for the protest week were $97,971 -- with daily costs running more than double the usual. Capitol police had beefed up staff on duty and canceled days off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would like a national conversation about this,&quot; Agnew said. &quot;I don't see why, that after the horrible year that Florida has had, we can't use this opportunity to rehabilitate the image of all Floridians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you go anywhere else, people think of Florida (as) not so good,&quot; he added. &quot;It looks like Florida's not friendly to children unless you go to Disney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists said they want the mock special session and Takeover Tuesdays to include discussion of racial profiling in Florida, the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law and what they call a school-to-prison pipeline for minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are doing is gathering legislators, advocates and experts in the field of juvenile justice and criminal justice in Florida, along with testimony from communities around the state,&quot; said Ciara Taylor of Dream Defenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor said the fact-finding revealed at the mock session and weekly gatherings should prod the state's lawmakers to take action -- soon, or at least in next spring's legislative session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are willing to do the research, the analysis, we are willing to listen to testimony they failed to listen to in the last legislative session,&quot; Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott met with protesters Thursday night, huddling with seven leaders of the rally but refusing to budge on stand your ground. House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, and Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, also have said they see no reason to revisit the self-defense measure approved in 2005. Stand your ground was not used by Zimmerman in fighting second-degree murder charges. But the measure did shape instructions given by the judge to jurors who acquitted Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wansley Walters, secretary of the state's Department of Juvenile Justice, met with protesters for about four hours Monday, fielding complaints about the system's treatment of minority youth and defending the administration's performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists, though, said that too often, state officials and school administrators dismiss minority concerns and enact laws aimed at managing them rather than trying to promote a society where racism isn't present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melanie Andrade, a Dream Defender chapter president at Florida A&amp;M University, said Tuesday that she grew up in suburban Polk County, living in three gated communities where she was still questioned by police about what she was doing walking in the neighborhood. &quot;Stand your ground did not fail Trayvon&nbsp;Martin,&quot; Andrade said. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin went through what we go through every day ... being criminalized on our front lawns and in our driveways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among activists newly arrived Tuesday at the Capitol was Didier Ortiz, 21, a senior at Florida Atlantic University. He was active with Dream Defenders this year when students at the school's Boca Raton campus protested the plan to name FAU's football stadium after the GEO Group, the private prison company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ortiz, who planned to stay a night in the Capitol before returning to class, said he thought the sit-in would eventually extract a concession from Scott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has a psychological impact, when you have someone outside your office every single day,&quot; Ortiz said. &quot;We are keeping up the pressure. It will make a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevie Wonder says he's boycotting Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pop music legend is trying to pressure state lawmakers to revise Florida's self-defense laws, which helped exonerate Sanford community watch volunteer George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed black teen, Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I decided today that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,&quot; Wonder told his audience during a concert in Canada. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish him luck. But history is against Wonder and any other performers he may persuade to rally for the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida has a long history of being shunned by the rest of America. If there was a way to sever the peninsula, it probably would have happened already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We tend to do a lot of stupid, embarrassing or infuriating things. And so we get treated like unruly children, put in timeout until we repent. But it never seems to shame us sufficiently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the Equal Rights Amendment, which was passed by Congress in 1972. Thirty-five states ratified the amendment that banned discrimination against women. Needing only three more states for passage, supporters of the amendment focused on Florida, one of the non-ratifying states, because of our reliance on tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1979, some 300 associations announced a boycott of Florida, saying that they wouldn't be holding conventions in the state until Florida ratified the ERA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida still hasn't ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. And last year, Florida set a new record for tourists, with 89.3 million visitors, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism marketing company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Florida passed a 5 percent tax on advertising in the spring of 1987, Johnson &amp; Johnson pulled all its national TV ads for Tylenol, Band-Aids and other products in Florida. More than a dozen other national advertisers, including Kimberly-Clark, General Mills and Hanes, joined the Florida ad boycott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That just made Florida teacher groups start a counter-campaign to urge state residents not to buy those company's products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By that summer, the ad boycott was abandoned -- months before the law was scrapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who try to make Florida behave eventually just give up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, the Boycott Florida Campaign started in Canada because of a new U.S. trade bill that punished Cuba. The plan was that Canadians would stop flocking to Florida in the winter months and that would cause lawmakers to scrap the embargo in the Helms-Burton Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo is still in place, and last winter 3.6 million Canadians visited Florida, another record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 2008 presidential election, Florida defied both political parties by ignoring the national calendar of presidential primaries. Florida's lawmakers went rogue, scheduling primaries early in hopes of getting more attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties reacted with sanctions against the state. The Democrats forbade their candidates from campaigning in Florida, and the Republicans said the early primary would cost the state half its delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did it teach Florida a lesson? No, Florida scheduled an earlier-than-sanctioned primary again for the 2012 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're slow learners. And there's not much under the sun that hasn't been tried already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We applaud Stevie Wonder, who said he will not come down to Florida until the law is changed,&quot; Martin Luther King III told the NAACP convention this month. &quot;We may have to look at not consuming Florida orange juice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's been done before too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on a practical level, if the state's orange juice crop can weather celebrity endorsers as dubious as Anita Bryant and Rush Limbaugh, I'm not sure another boycott's going to squeeze an extra drop of sense from the state's lawmakers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reading the latest penalties being dealt to the Main Street Bar and Grill, I continue to be amazed at the lack of understanding the local liquor commissions display regarding the underage patrons issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having owned and operated bar and restaurant operations in Bloomington and Normal for more than 10 years, I am extremely aware of the efforts made to keep underage drinkers out of these establishments. No bar owner wants to risk his business operations by violating the underage drinking laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have known Jim Jordan since his tenure on the Normal police force and have respect for his experience, but he, like other commissioners, has been a salaried employee and has no concept of trying to be an independent businessman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These sanctions and fines are severe enough to cause economic hardship to the employees, owners and families that rely on that business. I challenge any commissioner to spend Friday or Saturday night checking IDs at any of the more popular spots in Bloomington or Normal from 9 p.m. to midnight. At midnight, have a show of hands (with immunity) of those under 21. At least 10 percent is my prediction.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael 'Rudy' Rudicil </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomington </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov't. steals from our pocketbooks </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned citizens in my neighborhood are organizing a Neighborhood Watch, primarily because there were two thefts recently in our area. I think it is great for people in a neighborhood getting together to meet each other as I like to see more community bonding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the literature showed 28 burglaries during the third quarter of 2012 in Normal that on average had a loss of about $1,200 worth of goods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This made me think about how expensive the Twin City governments are getting. Over the past 20 years, our two cities have increased their taxes, fees, levies, etc., by more than $4,000 per family after adjusting for inflation and population growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, in Normal, and it's about the same for Bloomington, all 17,000 households are paying their local government more than $4,000 each, which is considerably more than $1,200 for each of 28 households. The money would be understandable, but not OK, if our governments provided more services, but they don't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we need a city watch more than a neighborhood watch.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer complex needs sponsors </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the real world, a business does not claim to turn a profit if it can't afford to pay for the building that it is in. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of U.S. Cellular Coliseum, a &quot;$176,800 operating profit&quot; minus the &quot;2013 bond payment of about $1.3 million for the building&quot; equals a LOSS of $1,123,200. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any other business would go out of business if it lost $1.12 million in a year, but the public is propping this one up. The only record that it might have set last year is for the &quot;lowest amount of public funds lost&quot; since being built. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now people want to apply this same math to a soccer complex that, even if incredibly successful, would not be able to generate a fraction of the &quot;operating profit&quot; that the Coliseum has managed to bring in. The math just doesn't add up, especially when you take into account our dilapidated roadways and massive pension liabilities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they want to build the soccer complex, it is time for the developers/supporters to start looking for sponsorships. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pension mess is a Ponzi scheme </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state is about to pull off the largest Ponzi scheme in Illinois history. Over the past 40-plus years, taxes have been collected, money deducted, for the purpose of funding state pensions. Our elected officials have diverted one way or another much of that money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To rub salt in our wounds, the legislatures have omitted judges from the pension overhaul plan. Judges should step up to the plate and take one for the team. We are all state retirees/employees. Some state departments (employees) cannot strike by contract or by law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those pensions were negotiated in good faith, were promised and earned. We did not hold them hostage. State retirees/employees are not the bad guys. The only thing we did wrong was believe our elected officials over the past 40 years when they said they would catch up the pension funds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We as voters need to look at all gubernatorial candidates that have held public office. We need to know how they voted on pension funding throughout their careers. If they voted just once against pension funding, then they have pension blood on their hands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would hope the news media would investigate and report which candidates have pension blood on their hands, placing the state in this fiscal mess. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing good comes from being vigilante </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime last year, coming from a root canal and still mentally fuzzy, I parked my pickup in a parking lot for some shopping. A typically windy day - the truck door jerked out of my hand and hit the car next to me. I checked, and seeing neither a dent nor any other damage, I walked away. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I finished shopping, returned to my truck. A vigilante had written a note that he left under the windshield wiper; he had seen my truck door hit the other car - and acted on it. The vigilante's note chastised me; he wrote that he had punished me in a way that I would notice. He had taken away the towing ball on the back bumper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I write this letter in reference to vigilantes. Some people feel a responsibility to keep other people in check - even to punish someone they see doing wrong. They become judge, jury and executioner. Others who see wrongs act differently. It is, I believe, the difference between vigilantes and followers of Jesus. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, a person is dead. In my case, some vandalism was the only result. If these judgmental vigilantes had seen the offender not as evil, but as needy, as fellow human beings, as brothers, the outcome could have been different. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking responsibility when you see a wrong done by others is good, but if your response is violent, vindictive - and it inflicts harm, that is as wrong as, or worse - than the original. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin not saint or hero </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media is making something complicated out of something simple in the Zimmerman-Martin case. The media portrays Martin as a child whose ONLY wish was just to get home. His home was in Miami. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems as though he was going to his father's house or to his father's girlfriend's house. Anyway, his destination was only about 100 yards away, and he could run that in about 20 seconds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, he chose to turn around and start stalking George, thus making him the aggressor. He then accosted George by punching him in the face, giving him two black eyes and a broken nose. Then he threw George on the ground and banged his head on the concrete sidewalk.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, will speak with attendees of the National Urban League's annual conference in Philadelphia on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Attorney General Eric Holder and the Rev. Al Sharpton also scheduled to attend the conference, the outcome of the George Zimmerman trial promises to take center stage during the four-day gathering at the Convention Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fulton will speak at the group's luncheon at noon Friday. Sharpton, whose National Action Network brought attention to the Zimmerman case, is also scheduled to be there. The luncheon is open only to registered attendees at the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Thursday from 8 to 10 a.m., Holder will host an &quot;Emergency Town Meeting&quot; on such issues as voting rights, affirmative action, and Zimmerman's acquittal in the slaying of Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also scheduled to attend the meeting is Fulton's family lawyer, Benjamin L. Crump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On July 13, a jury in Sanford, Fla., acquitted Zimmerman, a neighborhood-watch volunteer, who was accused of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of the unarmed black teen in the racially charged case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The verdict prompted a wave of protests across the country and calls for reexamining state &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), a longtime civil rights activist, will give the conference's keynote speech at 8 a.m. Friday. On Saturday he will receive the group's Civil Rights Champion Award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the conference events are free and open to the public. Others require official registration. Details are at the National Urban League's website, nul.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's growing opposition to so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws following the George Zimmerman case involving the shooting death of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin. President Obama says these state and local laws need a closer look. Harrisburg Mayor Linda Thompson says these laws, including Pennsylvania's &quot;Castle Doctrine,&quot; inspire vigilantism and protect those who act recklessly with guns.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you think so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws need to be reviewed and revised? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes: 529 (23 percent) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No: 1,749 (77 percent) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KQV runs two polls simultaneously, one from Internet users, the other from telephone callers. The nonscientific polls often do not reflect the same results. KQV updates its results from time to time, so the results on its website may vary from these results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's question </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stung by Americans' persistent worries about the economy and a Capitol gripped by controversy and gridlock, President Obama is suffering his lowest job approval numbers in nearly two years. A new McClatchy-Marist poll finds Obama's job approval at 41 percent, a sharp drop from April's 50 percent and his worst since a 39 percent rating in September 2011. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when economic and civil rights issues are at the forefront in the news, the National Urban League will hold its annual conference in Philadelphia, marking key anniversaries in African-American history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the group's conference, which runs today through Saturday at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, is &quot;Redeem the Dream: Jobs Rebuild America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, at which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, and the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patricia A. Coulter, president and CEO of the Philadelphia Urban League, said much of the focus of the conference, which is expected to draw more than 3,000 people, is on jobs and economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted that the formal name of the 1963 march was &quot;The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the March on Washington in 1963, and especially on the education front, we have made numerous gains. ... When we look at the economic side of the equation, the gains are not as significant,&quot; Ms. Coulter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we have to stay vigilant on the push for jobs in America and especially jobs in the urban cores where you have so many African Americans and people of color,&quot; Ms. Coulter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A job fair, with about 65 employers, will be held daily beginning Thursday at the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to jobs, the conference will focus on current issues, such as voting rights, affirmative action, and the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the slaying of Trayvon Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday morning, the group will host an Emergency Town Hall Meeting on those issues with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and a panel discussion with MSNBC commentator Melissa Harris-Perry and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the organization's president, Marc H. Morial, speakers include U.S. Reps. John Lewis, D-Ga., and John Conyers Jr., D-Mich.; the Rev. Al Sharpton; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; and filmmaker Ryan Coogler, Ms. Coulter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will also be a youth summit at Temple University, she said. Most of the events are free and open to the public. Some require registration. A schedule of events can be found at www.nul.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Urban League is a civil rights organization founded in 1910, dedicated to economic empowerment in historically underserved urban communities. The organization has 95 affiliates in 35 states and the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the highlights of the conference will be the formal unveiling of a signed copy of the Emancipation Proclamation at the National Constitution Center. It will be displayed through mid-September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln ordered the end of slavery in 1863 and paved the way for the 13th Amendment, which officially abolished slavery in 1865.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document had been part of the Lincoln Financial Group's collection of artifacts connected to Lincoln. In 2008, the company donated its copy to the Indiana State Museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allison Green, chief diversity officer for Lincoln Financial Group, said the company was proud to partner with the National Urban League on the display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With this anniversary, we, as a company, feel like it represented a unique opportunity to celebrate Lincoln's legacy of equality and opportunity,&quot; Ms. Green said. &quot;And what better time to bring it to Philadelphia now with the Urban League and their theme of 'Redeem the Dream?'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was born in the Hill District on Webster Avenue in 1942 and raised among whites, blacks, Italians, Jews, Lebanese and many other nationalities and colors of skin. Everyone seemed to get along with everyone else in those days. I don't remember the vast racial divide I see today. This divide seems to influence everybody's feelings about any court case involving people of different races. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the jury of the Zimmerman case was overwhelmingly white, it brings to mind another famous case in which the jury at that time was primarily black. I'm speaking of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. I can't help but think that the makeup of the jury had something to do with both outcomes. This is just food for thought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am appalled by Rob Rogers' cartoons and the whole Trayvon Martin debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First off is Rob Rogers' July 19 cartoon depicting an African-American boy being told by his mother not to wear a hoodie, not to walk through a nice neighborhood, etc., while the Caucasian boy is told not to forget to floss. Seriously, Mr. Rogers, could you be any more biased? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am aware of an incident in which a young white man who was minding his own business Downtown was waiting on his ride when three black men beat the daylights out of him and robbed him. Oh, that's right, that was not reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media, President Barack Obama and the Jessie Jackson types need to take a step back and stop aspiring to infuse race into everything. If you paid attention to the trial and the laws of the state of Florida, you would know that the jury called the verdict correctly. That's not to say it's not a shame that a young man lost his life; however, there is no benefit to thugs protesting in many states adopting this as an excuse to brutalize innocent human beings and destroy private property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes better sense to use your energy to change the laws in Florida. How refreshing it would be to see Mr. Jackson and Mr. Obama implementing a plan to restrain the black-on-black violence especially in Mr. Obama's home state of Illinois instead of injecting himself and his Hollywood cronies into a situation that is truly despairing for political gain and keeping the fires of bigotry burning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 24--The ability to gather in protest is an American right more than two centuries old. In many ways, it differentiates our country from some others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests have happened nationwide after the acquittal of Florida neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two such protests have happened in Stockton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have been loud -- all good protests probably should be to make their point -- and peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing has been troubling. In both protests, major Stockton streets were either shut down or had traffic impeded by protestors. That should not happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 16, three days after the Florida verdict, about 50 people gathered in front of City Hall to protest the Zimmerman verdict. Eventually, and multiple times, they moved into one of Stockton's busiest streets, El Dorado, and brought traffic to a halt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a protest happened near Weberstown Mall. Police -- clad in riot gear -- closed Pacific Avenue. One man was arrested for refusing police instructions to not go in the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential for an accident -- a car hitting a protestor or a bystander -- is omnipresent when protestors embark into traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had received information there was going to be a demonstration at March Lane and Pacific Avenue, and the demonstrators had plans to take over the intersection and block traffic,&quot; Officer Joe Silva, a spokesman for the Stockton Police Department, said. &quot;Our department was not going to allow this to happen and let demonstrators flagrantly violate the law, which would create major safety issues, not only for the demonstrators but also for vehicles and uninvolved pedestrians in the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there are going to be further protests -- over this or any other issues -- we urge those involved to take traffic out of the equation. It creates a public safety hazard and, in fact, takes away from the message the protesters are trying to convey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One other commonality of the two local protests is they were as much about James Rivera as they were about Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rivera was the Stockton teenager fatally shot by Stockton police following a pursuit in July 2010. A report from the district attorney said officers were justified in using deadly force against Rivera. The report concluded that three officers fired a total of 29 shots after they said Rivera, who had crashed a stolen van he was driving into a garage while trying to evade them, put the vehicle into reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rivera's mother, Dionne Smith-Downs, was very vocal at both protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm James Rivera's momma and I hope all of y'all see my face, because I'm not going anywhere. My son's blood is on the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She later added: &quot;Same thing that happened to Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the circumstances of the deaths of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and James Rivera differ greatly, both of their deaths were tragic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deaths of young people have a commonality that was expressed in President Barack Obama's recent speech:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,&quot; the president said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.&quot; -- Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distill it to its marrow, and that is what African-Americans have been telling other Americans since February 2012 when the unarmed teenager was stalked and killed by George Zimmerman, who, for no good reason, thought him suspicious. And it is essentially what President Obama said in an impromptu appearance in the White House press room last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We African-Americans see ourselves, our sons and grandsons, in this dead boy. And we hear no whisper of &quot;there but for the grace of God,&quot; but, rather, a nightmare scream of what could yet be, in a nation that would afterward slander them till it seemed they deserved what they got and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pointedly including himself among our number, in testifying that even the most powerful man in the world once saw women clutch their purses when he got on an elevator, Obama committed an act of moral courage. It was all the more remarkable because it carried no political upside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that everyone understood. &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me,&quot; said the president, after which Sean Hannity, a grand wizard of the extreme right, professed confusion, wondering if by this, Obama meant he &quot;smoked pot and he did a little blow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so it goes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That coarse attempt at wit pretty much emblematizes the behavior of many so-called conservatives since Zimmerman's acquittal. They have redoubled their efforts to fashion a fairly ordinary teenager into some general purpose thug who somehow needed shooting, and his killer into some righteous street avenger who stalked him from justifiable fear because, &quot;we all know&quot; young black men are criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Young black men.&quot; Not Trayvon Benjamin Martin, 17, son of Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton. Because the first casualty of racism is individuality, the right to be your singular self.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what was stolen from Trayvon even before his life. It is stolen anew every time some pundit bloviates upon the perceived criminality of young black men to justify his killing. That perception is rooted more in stereotype and fear than actual fact, but put that aside and ask yourself this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What man or woman among us would be willing to let the rest of us judge them based not upon who they are and what they have done, but solely upon our perceptions of people like them? There is, for instance, a perception that methamphetamine use is concentrated among white people in red states -- in other words, Sean Hannity's audience. May we treat all white people in red states accordingly? Will they go for that deal? Of course not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet we daily crucify young black men upon that cross and pretend to moral righteousness in the doing. Trayvon is not the first victim. He's not even the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is the one whose death has made us cry, &quot;Enough!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There comes a time when people get tired. So said Martin Luther King in his first speech as leader of the Montgomery bus boycott. From that fatigue grew a movement that reshaped America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One hopes people are that tired again -- and that it spurs a new movement to challenge not just laws, but attitudes so corroded and stained some of us cannot even muster compassion for the death of a blameless boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is wrong. It is unworthy of decent people. And so, it cannot stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thing the rest of the country may not fully appreciate is how deeply that loss of individuality cuts for African-Americans, how closely it binds us. So yes, of course Barack Obama is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. And let there be no mistake:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am Trayvon, too.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Brother&quot; is the Vegemite of reality TV: Either you love it, or you find it so noxious and distasteful it's impossible to comprehend that anyone else would willingly, let alone happily, ingest it. For the past 13 years   every single summer since 2000 and one ill-conceived February   a dozen-odd people have willingly isolated themselves for three months inside a floodlit Panopticon made to look like a home, their every move broadcast over all-day livestreams and condensed into three prime-time hours per week, all for a half-million-dollar prize. The participants on &quot;Big Brother&quot; are, of course, not &quot;here to make friends,&quot; and regularly engage in all sorts of scheming, manipulation and histrionics. On this show, when one player calls another a liar, another can safely reply, &quot;Yeah, I don't know what game you're playing, but I'm playing Big Brother.&quot; But this season, the show's 15th, some &quot;Big Brother&quot; contestants have plumbed a new nadir of atrocious behavior: blatant racism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost as soon as this season began, close watchers of the various Web streams began to catalog racial slurs, as well as homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic ones, that were not making it to air. CBS has historically sanitized the livestreams for prime time: &quot;Big Brother&quot; has a long history of contestants being racist   if not this racist   but CBS has previously claimed that such comments do &quot;not meet the network's standards&quot; and it would cut them out of the network airings, leaving them to the hawk-eyed thousands closely monitoring the livestreams. Not this time. In this summer when Paula Deen and Trayvon Martin are on front of mind, instead of ignoring its contestants' racism, Big Brother has made it one of the major storylines, giving audiences a front-row seat not just to the sort of hateful mindset and speech that usually occurs behind closed doors, but to the self-delusion of bigots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half the cast has, at this point, engaged in some kind of casual hate speech, but there are two major culprits. The first, Aaryn Gries   yes, her name really is an anagram for &quot;Aryan&quot;   is a blond-haired, blue-eyed, Texas-born carapace of pure vileness. Aaryn insists she is a &quot;good&quot; person. She has also put on an &quot;Asian voice&quot; to joke about getting her nails done; said that Helen, the only Asian-American on the cast, should &quot;go make some rice&quot;; and remarked that one should be careful in the dark around Candice, the only African-American woman on the cast, &quot;because you might not see the bitch.&quot; She has also taken issue with pediatric speech therapist Candice's pronunciation of the word &quot;asked.&quot; GinaMarie Zimmerman, a loud Staten Islander who is Aaryn's blunt, uncouth attack dog, has said that Helen &quot;should be kissing our a-- and serving us some f---ing rice&quot;; declared that Candice &quot;gets that f---ing blackness&quot;; and in one of the more surreal clips referred to welfare as &quot;[N-word] insurance&quot; by whispering the word into the ears of the two men she was speaking with, apparently aware that she shouldn't be saying it but unwilling to stop herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The derogatory language, which Aaryn and GinaMarie had previously used only in front of other white cast members   you know the saying, evil flourishes when less evil people do nothing because they are trying to win a game show   made it to prime time when Aaryn provoked a flabbergasting scene that caused the house to turn against her. (She's up for elimination this week; GinaMarie is not.) In a fit of pique, Aaryn flipped Candice's mattress off the bed for no reason. When Candice asked who had done that, Aaryn began to snake her head and taunt, &quot;What you gonna do, girl? Where's yo class, girl?&quot; GinaMarie, escalating, got in Candice's face and asked if she &quot;wanted the black to come out.&quot; (There's a class component at play here: GinaMarie's bigotry is classically white working-class, a reflexive xenophobia that's more out there but less frightening for it. Aaryn is genteel, racist but knowing enough to not get busted saying the N-word. Hers is the racism that usually knows how to hide.) The incident ended only when Howard, the other African-American in the house, carried Candice out of the room. Crying, Candice said to him, &quot;They have called me 'Sheniqua,' flipped my bed, and I am supposed to go into another room and hide?&quot; Howard implored her to keep her cool: &quot;This game doesn't care about what's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would think that only someone extraordinarily stupid would say these things in a house covered with cameras, where there is so little privacy that players change their underwear underneath a towel. But it's more insidious than that: &quot;Big Brother&quot; generally encourages bad behavior, and these women seem to think that their behavior is no worse than the standard sh---talking, slurring, scheming and gamesmanship that regularly goes down. Aaryn isn't hiding her true self, not simply because she is dumb, but because she is privileged and sheltered and doesn't think she's being that racist and she imagines that everyone watching at home will see it the same way. They won't: Aaryn and GinaMarie have both already been fired from their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the mattress incident, Candice came upon GinaMarie sobbing on the couch, with Aaryn comforting her. Candice, finding almost supernatural reserves of compassion, sat down and began to rub GinaMarie's back. Aaryn took the opportunity to apologize. &quot;Candice, I'm sorry,&quot; Aaryn said. &quot;Anybody that knows me knows that just because I'm Southern, and I say things that probably aren't appropriate all the time, I have nothing against any other race. And if I make a comment that seems like I do, I don't want it to be taken that way, and I don't want to offend you.&quot; This is the kind of thing, distasteful as reality shows can sometimes be, that would be almost impossible to plausibly fictionalize, even though it is a fact of life all over America. The racist who believes she has nothing against any other race, who apologizes largely because it is strategically sound while still thinking of herself as an open-minded person, who is a cruel bully until she becomes self-pitying and defensive, is almost too ridiculously grotesque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big Brother&quot; has congratulated itself a bit for putting all of this on air: When Julie Chen, the host, spoke about it on her talk show &quot;The Talk,&quot; her co-host Sara Gilbert said, &quot;I'm happy that CBS and 'Big Brother' aired the comments, because I feel like it's good for people to see it, and let these people deal with the consequences when they get out of the house.&quot; But &quot;Big Brother&quot; plays a part in all of this, even if it was just giving Aaryn the rope with which to hang herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a larger issue, which is how the show is cast: GinaMarie described Candice and Howard as &quot;tokens,&quot; a nasty thing to say that also, if you look over the past casts of &quot;Big Brother,&quot; appears to be true. As with ABC's &quot;The Bachelor,&quot; which has been unsuccessfully sued for its obvious bias against people of color, &quot;Big Brother&quot; has racially problematic casting. The show usually has exactly one black woman and exactly one black man on cast. One year there were three African-Americans. There have been seasons with just one. A little less than 40 percent of America is not white; &quot;Big Brother's&quot; cast does not come close to reflecting this. The series can disavow the behavior of its contestants, but it continues to cast the show as if white people are the ones who have the right to be there. This season the show cast people loathsome enough to verbalize that privilege. When Aaryn and GinaMarie get kicked out of the house, they are going to have lots of explaining to do. But so will &quot;Big Brother.&quot;<BR><BR>c</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focus on reality, not ideology, on reproductive health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your honesty and bravery in publishing your editorial on empty pro-life rhetoric (&quot;Culture of lies,&quot; July 17).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is shameful that when the Missouri Legislature had the chance to pass Medicaid expansion (a policy that would actually save lives), they chose instead to endorse more needless restrictions on reproductive health care. Fortunately, community health care providers, such as Planned Parenthood, are continuing to make quality care affordable and accessible to those with few other options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of chasing ideological fantasies to score votes, our representatives should focus on implementing reality-based solutions to the problems facing our state. Passing the Comprehensive Sex Education Act and expanding access to contraception and prenatal care would be good starts to improving infant and maternal health outcomes, lowering the rate of unplanned pregnancies (and thus abortions), and ameliorating the quality of life and health of all Missourians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever you think about reproductive choice, I think we can all agree that is a positive goal to work toward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quin Rich o Clayton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial criticizing pro-life community can't be taken seriously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a crock! The Post-Dispatch editorial &quot;Culture of lies&quot; (July 17) was so filled with liberal doublespeak that it was impossible to take seriously. To call people who are pro-life liars is beyond the pale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We in the pro-life community believe in personal responsibility, morals and virtue. We believe that people should refrain from having sex outside of marriage knowing that the results will be devastating - sexually transmitted diseases, broken relationships, abortion and a culture in a downward spiral. The liberal mindset of the Post-Dispatch constantly promotes sex with no boundaries, paying only lip service to abstinence as evidenced by the editorial's horrendous lie that &quot;birth control is the most effective way to reduce abortions.&quot; No, abstinence is the most effective way to reduce abortions. Period, end of discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial used Barney Frank as their resident moralist, citing his summation of pro-lifers saying, &quot;(They) believe life begins at conception and ends at birth.&quot; That is an insult to people of faith in the pro-life community who operate more schools, hospitals, adoption agencies and charities catering to children and families than any other entity in America. What is Barney Frank doing to help children?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has become vogue in the liberal press to mock people who believe in traditional values. Author and retired Air Force Col. Jeff O'Leary put it well, &quot;Virtue angers and threatens those whose own lives have been lived under the shadows of expediency and vice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beth Henson o Festus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President fosters racial divide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unfortunate that the president used Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's death to express his pent-up racial hostility (&quot;&quot;Martin 'could have been me,' &quot; July 20). Similarly, Hillary Clinton and others used this matter to further their political agendas. There is no doubt that Trayvon's death was a preventable tragedy. Had George Zimmerman followed the police directive not to follow Martin, the incident would not have occurred. Many of us agree that Zimmerman should have suffered some consequences, though not necessarily a murder charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, from the outset President Obama interjected himself into the matter by proclaiming that if he had a son, he would have looked like Trayvon. Now, in response to the jury's verdict, the president says that he could have been Trayvon. He went on to say that had Trayvon been white, he may still be alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps race was a factor in this one incident. But, that is no basis for berating the entire white community, many of whom were not at all pleased with the results of the trial. The fact is that the greatest danger to black kids is other black kids. Literally, hundreds are killed in their own communities. One must also ask how safe a white person would be walking through many predominantly black neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning the argument around, how many of the several victims of &quot;knockout gangs,&quot; including the man who was killed while walking home with his wife from the grocery store, would not have been attacked if they were black? And, if one of these knockout victims had shot his attackers, would we then hear that deadly force was not justified to avoid being beaten up?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is tragic enough that Trayvon needlessly lost his life; there is no need to add to the tragedy by fostering racial divide, especially by the president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jerry Powers o Webster Groves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violent behavior, not race, is at the core of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me,&quot; said the president. Can we pause and go beyond the heat in order to get to some light? Everything appears to be based on Trayvon's being black and George Zimmerman is not. Skin color takes precedence over behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no contest to the fact that Trayvon was black and unarmed. There is no contest that Zimmerman was armed (weapon not drawn) and is not black. Zimmerman erred when he didn't stay put and await the police. What about Trayvon's actions? Suspicion arose because he was crossing the yards of neighbors - still, not really enough to merit being followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman lost sight of Trayvon. Trayvon hid behind a bush, jumped out at Zimmerman, punched him in the nose, breaking it, and pushed him to the ground. He then banged his head against the concrete and, according to Zimmerman, allegedly threatened to kill him. The gun at this point was drawn and shot. An unarmed black teenager is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question to the president is this: If you were Trayvon, would you have resorted to physical violence against someone who hadn't touched you, would you have asked him why he was following you or, better yet, in your youthful energy, would you have run away and straight to your father's home?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had someone else of another race acted as Trayvon did, isn't it possible he also would have been killed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus has been mostly on race. Perhaps some focus should be directed to physical violence - behavior. Unwise decisions on both parts ended in tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helen Louise Herndon o St. Peters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South County Connector is not worth it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of The American Institute of Architects St. Louis Chapter have reviewed the South County Connector Draft Environmental Impact Study, and we have concerns on many levels, including the estimated cost of spending $110 million for a roadway to run from Big Bend and Flora avenues in Maplewood to River Des Peres at Watson in Shrewsbury, approximating the route of Metrolink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We share the concerns that have been expressed by Maplewood, Shrewsbury, Citizens for Modern Transit, Trailnet and the Board of Aldermen in St. Louis, where one-fourth of the roadway is to be located. We believe that the connector's impact on the newly redeveloped Deer Creek retail center, its impact on residential areas and its impact on recently developed trails places automotive transportation issues over economic development and quality of life issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of our primary objections is perhaps more subtle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Franklin Dart is not Trayvon Martin, and James Robert Crocker is not George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the confrontation between Mr. Crocker and Mr. Dart on a gravel sandbar adjacent to the Meramec River near Steelville, Mo., may well hinge on the same legal analysis that allowed Florida jurors to conclude that it was perfectly legal for Mr. Zimmerman to shoot Mr. Martin dead. Even though Mr. Martin was unarmed. Even though Mr. Zimmerman created the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zimmerman was scared and he had a gun. Next case, please. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, Mr. Crocker shot Mr. Dart in the face, killing him in front of his wife and friends, who were floating down the Meramec on a hot summer day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My husband tried to calm the guy down,&quot; Mr. Dart's widow, Loretta Dart, told Post-Dispatch reporter Kim Bell. &quot;He went to the guy's arm to try to stop him, but the guy jerked back and popped him in the face. I watched him be shot in the face and fall down. I watched my husband bleed to death. He was a wonderful man. He didn't deserve this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, by all accounts, he didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, neither did Leonard J. Smith Jr., deserve to die. Leonard was 11. He was shot to death in a tragic accident in Belleville last week when he and several other children were playing with a gun at a private home. The shooter was 6 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause of death in both cases is the same: GSW. Gunshot wound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One case was accidental. The other was not. But the symptom that leads to lives snuffed out too early is identical. Too many guns. Too many people who believe that the America of 2013 should allow no restrictions - none - on what a man and his gun can do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Children's Defense Fund, based on 2010 statistics, 52 children or teens died every week - yes, every week - at the hand of a gun. The United States has 10 times more gun deaths among children and teens than other high-income countries. That's what happens when you have more guns per 100 people (about 94 of them) than any other country in the world. Second place? Yemen, home of al-Qaida on the Arabian Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the National Rifle Association and those who do that gun-loving organization's bidding, all those dead children are just collateral damage in a war for ultimate gun freedom. And Mr. Dart? Wrong place. Wrong time. Too bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listen to Mr. Crocker's response after he shot a man dead because one of his friends got out of a canoe on a public river and walked into the woods to urinate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have the power here,&quot; he told Mr. Dart and his friends, according to one of the witnesses. &quot;I have the power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Missouri law, if the gravel bar in question is indeed his land, he might have a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri, like Florida, has a version of a &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; law, which means a person with a gun on his own property who fears for his life doesn't have a duty to retreat. He can shoot to defend himself. Even if it's just to kill a trespassing floater whose friend is answering nature's call. End of story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Crocker has been charged with second-degree murder and is being held at the Crawford County Jail. Here's what's likely to happen:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyer will argue self-defense. The floaters were drinking and some of them had river rocks in their hands. The trial will turn on obscure Missouri law regarding gravel bars along rivers and whether they are actually private property. That depends on whether the river was considered navigable. It's a complicated area of law, according to those who have studied it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Missouri lawmakers have long been protective of the property rights of landowners along the state's float streams. Some of them have been suspicious of the National Scenic Riverways designation for the Current and Jacks Fork rivers. Much of the Legislature's paranoia about the nonbinding United Nations Agenda 21 sustainability plan was driven by a fear of U.N. incursion in the Ozarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there's little doubt that Missouri lawmakers, the same ones who passed a law this year seeking to nullify every federal gun law ever conceived, will come up with a Stand Your Gravel Bar law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any suggestion that our gun culture is to blame will be shoved aside as unconstitutional liberal drivel. Never mind that nobody had to die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dart, who lived in Robertsville, was 48. The Army veteran left behind a wife and stepson. He's dead because somebody had to pee and somebody else had a gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ST. LOUIS o The choir of Centennial Christian Church sang under the tall arched rafters as the sun filtered in through stained glass windows. The Sudan Illustrators troupe joyfully danced the South African boot dance, with whoops and cheers. A poet paid tribute; many prayers and psalms were said; and speaker after speaker recalled the courage and recited the words of the great South African leader Madiba, Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 300 people - blacks, whites, Christians, Muslims and Jews - filled the pews at the church on Fountain Avenue to celebrate the recent 95th birthday of the ailing former South African president and to honor his life, legacy and values. St. Louis was one of 13 cities hosting a Mandela celebration event. Each city was chosen for its region's activism during the Free South African movement before multiracial democratic elections in 1994 ended the apartheid era with Mandela's election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African General Counsel Vuyiswua Tulelo , based in Chicago, traveled here for the event to represent the South African government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lew Moye, president of the St. Louis chapter of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, was the main organizer of the Mandela tribute here. He and black trade unionists had played a leadership role in fighting apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here to celebrate a great servant for justice and freedom, the warrior who as a young man fought in the streets, in the courts, in the prisons and is fighting in the hospital,&quot; he said. &quot;We must keep him in our prayers for continued recovery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moye and St. Louis Comptroller Darlene Green both recalled Mandela's views on racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background or his religion,&quot; Mandela had said. &quot;People must learn to hate and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers included leaders of civil rights organizations such as the NAACP, and leaders of religious institutions. Some had personally rallied in anti-apartheid protests in St. Louis. Others merely loved what Mandela represents and his quiet, humble demeanor. Many were government officials and labor leaders who said they were inspired by him, and some had been active in the civil rights movement here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some who spoke, including former state legislator Betty Thompson, came dressed in colorful robes and dresses from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interfaith Partnership also played a key role in the evening's celebration, with Imam Muhamed Hasic, partnership president, Rabbi Harold Kaplansky and the Rev. Art Cavitt delivering comments or prayers. Other speakers had been activists of the St. Louis Free South Africa movement, which had staged protests against apartheid, and organized boycotts of Shell Oil and entertainers tied to the apartheid regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The celebration included the singing of the South African National Anthem and the inspirational &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the recollections of Mandela's courage and contributions, several references were made to contemporary political issues, including the Trayvon Martin case in Sanford, Fla., in which neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman was acquitted recently in the shooting death of the unarmed teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khabib Waheed, who also had been part of the St. Louis Committee to Free South Africa, talked about Americans today needing &quot; the courage to have difficult conversations&quot; about race in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Soutier, president of the St. Louis Labor Council, and Van Simpson, the first black president of the UAW Local 2250 in Wentzville, talked about Mandela and labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our struggles may not compare to Mandela's. but we still have to fight to have basic voting rights, to educate our children and to provide medical care for our young and elderly,&quot; Simpson said. &quot;We struggle to stop the savage attacks on our poor and impoverished. As we join forces we hear &quot;Yes We Can, Si'Se Pede.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activist Zaki Baruti talked about God's goodness in taking Mandela &quot;from jail cell to the presidency&quot; in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never thought I'd see a person of color the president of the United States,&quot; he added in reference to the 2008 election of Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Samuel Hylton, pastor emeritus of Centennial Christian Church, who had been active in protesting apartheid, said: &quot;The struggle continues and will continue ... until all racism and hatred is wiped from this earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recited the words of the Biblical prophet Amos, also famously quoted by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. - &quot;Justice shall roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream ...&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't begrudge people who profit from personal life experiences. There's often something we can learn from other people's dramas and traumas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there was something upsetting about the swift actions by one juror in the trial of George Zimmerman, who was found innocent of all charges stemming from the shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now, we know this person only by her court designation, B37. She was the first juror to grant an interview, sitting down with CNN's Anderson Cooper in a session that aired the Monday and Tuesday after the verdict. The Florida mother of two stayed in the shadows, opting to remain anonymous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Cooper asked Juror B37 why she agreed to speak out, she said, &quot;I want people to know that we put everything into everything to get this verdict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Did you realize how big this trial had become?&quot; Cooper asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had no clue, no clue whatsoever,&quot; the juror answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But look how quickly she and her husband moved to hire a literary agent to shop a book. The verdict was Saturday night. Makes me question her motives. How could she not see the media crowded into the Florida courtroom?  She signed with Sharlene Martin, an agent for other high-profile people involved in controversial court cases. In interviews, Martin said the juror's book would be about &quot;the commitment it takes to serve and be sequestered on a jury in a highly publicized murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I don't buy that and neither did many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As quickly as this deal was made, the public took to social media to voice their outrage at someone &amp;#8212; well, other than the lawyers &amp;#8212; making money from this tragic and heartbreaking case. There was a great amount of indignation on Twitter about the deal and congratulations when it was canceled. A petition drive on Change.org drew more than 1,300 signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin quickly dropped the couple as clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe I made a grave error in judgment in wanting to represent this story,&quot; she wrote in an email to the Los Angeles Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, in a statement, Martin said: &quot;After careful consideration regarding the proposed book project with Zimmerman Juror B37, I have decided to rescind my offer of representation in the exploration of a book based upon this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the agent backed out, dozens of people tweeted their gratitude. Nothing like a social media smack-down to get you to rethink your actions and put your greed in perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I realize it was necessary for our jury to be sequestered in order to [protect] our verdict from unfair outside influence, but that isolation shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case,&quot; Juror B37 said in a statement. &quot;The potential book was always intended to be a respectful observation of the trial from my and my husband's perspectives solely and it was to be an observation that our &amp;#8216;system' of justice can get so complicated that it creates a conflict with our &amp;#8216;spirit' of justice. Now that I am returned to my family and to society in general, I have realized that the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before I was called to sit on this jury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She should have followed the lead of her fellow jurors who seem to have a better understanding of what this trial meant to people and the families involved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just having Lisa Madigan serve as attorney general while her father is House speaker has already created a potential conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your recent editorial mentions that even though Speaker Michael Madigan has helped create the pension problem the state is currently experiencing, he is using his political clout to hamper lawmakers from passing pension legislation that is fair and sensible. The legality and ethical aspects of Madigan's proposed legislation also concerns lawmakers who are opposing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the speaker's so-called &quot;pension reform&quot; legislation is passed, it will be in violation of the Illinois Constitution. One of the main elements of his legislation is to slash or eliminate COLAs (cost-of-living adjustments) which retired state workers have paid for. By doing this, a retiree's pension would be diminished by a third. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If any &quot;pension reform&quot; legislation is passed that diminishes pensions earned by retirees, there will be legal action. I cannot help but think that Lisa Madigan would not be favor of violating the Illinois Constitution. Will she forego her principles, if it means going against the powerful speaker?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others sacrificed to raise Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Barack Obama said he could have been Trayvon. The president's grandparents moved to Hawaii to raise him, to give him a stable life when his mother could not. They moved from Kansas to Hawaii to raise their grandson and his sister as a family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obama seems to have forgotten the sacrifices others made to give him a normal life. Sadly, Trayvon did not have people who loved him like the Dunhams. I wonder if Madelyn and Stanley Dunham think they raised another Trayvon?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President's remarks were telling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the president stated that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago,&quot; he revealed more about his past than he has since he began his campaign for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We knew he smoked marijuana when he was younger, but I don't think &quot;lean&quot; or &quot;drank&quot; were thought of at that time. I hope he doesn't think that statement is a compliment to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin or himself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A right is a right &amp;#8212; right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently there has been much news coverage concerning two of our &quot;constitutional rights,&quot; one being the right to vote and the other being the right of our citizens to arm themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In dealing with the right to vote a number of legislators put forth the motion that voters should have a picture ID to prove they are who they say they are. The opponents of this idea claimed that the &quot;poor&quot; and the &quot;disabled&quot; were being discriminated against inasmuch as they would be unable to afford the cost of the picture and not be able to go to a place to obtain a picture. It appears the opponents have won this battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In dealing with the constitutional right to carry, opponents of this bill, after trying hard to defeat it, offered obstacles designed to make it as hard as possible to obtain a permit to carry. Among them: An applicant must have a background check, pay $150 for the permit application, have a picture ID, complete 16 hours of training (the most in the nation) and wait a long time for approval. If not approved a committee in secret will review the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What do the poor who also might want protection using the concealed carry law do to get a permit? How could the legislators and the governor be so inconsiderate? Where was the &quot;hardship&quot; talk by the opponents when they layered rule upon rule that made concealed carry so difficult? How hypocritical can they be?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TUNIS, Tunisia -- Angry anti-government demonstrations broke out Thursday across Tunisia after gunmen killed the leader of a leftist opposition party, raising fears of new chaos on the difficult road to democracy in the cradle of the Arab Spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just five months after a similar assassination plunged the country into crisis, two gunmen shot Mohammed Brahmi, leader of the Popular Current party, in his car outside his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunisia is struggling after overthrowing dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Tunisians are fed up with the government led by the moderate Islamist ruling party, Ennahda, which appears unable to handle a faltering economy, address popular unrest over unmet expectations and crack down on a rising extremist Islamist movement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters immediately blamed the latest killing on the government. Soon after news broke, crowds gathered outside the Interior Ministry in the heart of Tunis calling for its downfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's largest trade unions called for a general strike Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HPV vaccine rate disappoints officials</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATLANTA -- Only about half of U.S. teenage girls have gotten a controversial cervical cancer vaccine -- a rate that's changed little in three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're dropping the ball,&quot; said Dr. Thomas Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &quot;This is a huge disappointment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 54 percent of teenage girls have received at least one of the three HPV shots. Only a third were fully immunized with all three doses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's rates were essentially unchanged from 2011, and up only slightly from 2010. Rates for other vaccines aimed at adolescents have risen much faster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A big part of the reason: Family doctors aren't prodding patients to get HPV shots as forcefully as they recommend other vaccines, health officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman juror wanted conviction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. -- The second juror to speak publicly told ABC News in an interview made available Thursday that she feels that George Zimmerman got away with murder for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin, but that there wasn't enough evidence at trial to convict him under Florida law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror B29 told Robin Roberts that she favored convicting Zimmerman of second-degree murder when deliberations began by the six-member, all-women jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the juror that was going to give them a hung jury,&quot; she said. &quot;I fought to the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by the second day of deliberating, she realized there wasn't enough proof to convict the 29-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer of a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God,&quot; she said. &quot;And at the end of the day, he's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's leaders will put Bo Xilai on trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- Deposed politician Bo Xilai will go on trial on charges of corruption and abuse of power within weeks, wrapping up a festering scandal that China's new leaders want disposed of as they cement their authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bo, 64, was a rising political star who ran the metropolis of Chongqing until he fell from power last year in a scandal that saw his wife convicted of killing a British businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the official Xinhua News Agency announced that he was charged with bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power and will stand trial in the eastern city of Jinan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, Bo has been the unfinished business of China's political transition, with questions over his fate casting a shadow over the Communist Party's new leaders under Xi Jinping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Korean factory park negotiations fail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Thursday threatened to re-station troops at a stalled inter-Korean factory park just across the tense border separating the two Koreas, as minor scuffles reportedly broke out between delegates from the rivals after failed talks meant to restart the complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pyongyang has warned Seoul before that it would bring back the military units that were stationed at the North Korean border city of Kaesong before the factory park was set up there in 2004 during a previous period of detente between the rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said the latest threat was an effort to pressure Seoul to agree to a quick reopening of the industrial complex, which provided badly needed hard currency to Pyongyang. The complex was shut in April amid dueling threats of war following U.N. sanctions against North Korea's February nuclear test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WWII airman's remains returned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALBANY, N.Y. -- The remains of a World War II airman have been identified and will be returned to his hometown for burial, nearly 70 years after his plane and two others slammed into a remote, jungle-covered mountainside in the South Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DNA samples provided by relatives matched that of Sgt. Dominick Licari, who was 31 when his A-20 Havoc bomber crashed into a mountain in Papua-New Guinea on March 13, 1944.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Augustus &quot;Mort&quot; Licari said Thursday that he and his only other surviving sibling, Katherine Frank of Darien, Conn., were notified last week that their brother's bone fragments and dog tags were recovered last year at the crash site by a team from the U.S. Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Psychopaths can exhibit empathy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannibal Lecter can probably feel for his victims, but only if you ask him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A brain-imaging study of 18 violent, psychopathic criminals in the Netherlands, the largest such study undertaken, suggests they can summon empathy when prompted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, published Wednesday in the journal Brain, showed that empathic circuits that are unconsciously activated in the brains of normal people may be dormant or switched off in psychopaths -- not absent, as commonly thought. Those circuits, the study showed, can be activated after psychopaths are prompted to see a situation from someone else's point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They do have empathy; it's just that it's not always on,&quot; said neuroscientist Christian Keysers of the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, lead author of the study, undertaken in Groningen, Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O.J. Simpson asks board for leniency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CARSON CITY, Nev. -- O.J. Simpson went before a parole board and pleaded for leniency on his armed robbery and kidnapping sentence Thursday as he expressed regret for his actions and described being an upstanding inmate who earns pennies an hour keeping gym equipment sanitized and umpiring and coaching games in the prison yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simpson also said he has become a counselor of sorts to fellow inmates doing time for similar crimes and noted that he has made amends with his victims in a botched heist of memorabilia in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just wish I never went to that room,&quot; the 66-year-old Simpson said during a 15-minute appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is eligible for parole on only some of his concurrent sentences for various convictions. Even if the parole board ruled in his favor, he would have to spend at least another four years behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Militants kill 42 in attacks across Iraq</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD -- Emboldened militants in Iraq set up their own checkpoint to kill drivers and bombed crowded cafes Thursday in the deadliest of a series of attacks that killed at least 42 people, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 550 people have been killed in violent attacks so far this month, according to an Associated Press count, as violence continues during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The speaker of Iraqi parliament even has acknowledged that insecurity in the nation likely will get worse after a massive al-Qaida-claimed prison break freed hundreds of inmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadliest attack Thursday happened when a bomb exploded inside a crowded cafe north of Baghdad, killing 16 diners and wounding 20.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;How much is the Capitol sit-in costing taxpayers in police overtime and other costs? We asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which runs the Capitol Police. They are looking into it and will have a response by the afternoon, spokeswoman says.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLAHASSEE - The ongoing sit-in protest at the Capitol, now in its second week, so far has cost the state more than $97,000, including overtime and extra police, according to preliminary figures released Tuesday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of that amount is regular time and overtime logged by Capitol Police, which has kept watch on the 30 to 50 protesters who have been living, eating and sleeping in the hallway outside Gov. Rick Scott's office around the clock. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least five uniformed officers were observed keeping watch over the protesters after hours on Monday. The Capitol closes to the public at 5 p.m. and reopens at 8 a.m. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But agents from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement also have been called in to spell uniformed officers, FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger said. The department oversees the Capitol Police, which also patrols other state government buildings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the figures are part of the regular cost of patrolling the Capitol. The extra costs - about $37,000 - are being covered by the department's overtime budget for now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We'll have to address that as we go forward, Plessinger said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steven Pargett, spokesman for the Dream Defenders, the group organizing the sit-in, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plessinger also released a report of minor incidents from the last week, including one in which officers discovered two men and a woman partly clothed in the Capitol chapel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everyone was instructed to get completely dressed and was informed the chapel was for worship, not sleeping, the report said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also noted that an aide to Rep. Alan Williams, D-Tallahassee, had brought several protesters in through the north lobby before 5 p.m. on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The north lobby door is unsecured and those who enter through this door do not go through the (metal detectors), according to the report. The report also said that Williams delivered food to the group over the weekend. The sit-in formally began last Tuesday, though protesters first arrived outside the Capitol the Saturday night before that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the Dream Defenders have said they were motivated to come to Tallahassee after the acquittals in the George Zimmerman trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimmerman, a community-watch volunteer, shot 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin during a February 2012 confrontation in a gated community in Sanford. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A struggle ensued, and Zimmerman said he fired his handgun in self-defense. A six-member female jury cleared Zimmerman of all charges in Martin's death.Protesters have asked Scott to call lawmakers back into special session to revisit the state's stand your ground law and consider a Trayvon&nbsp;Martin Civil Rights Act. Scott met with some of the group members but refused their request, saying he supports the state's self-defense laws.On Tuesday, they announced they were planning their own mock legislative session, saying they have invited lawmakers, experts and advocates to meet with them on Tuesdays over the next three weeks. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin's legacy should be that his tragic death has caused everyone to talk openly about the problems in our society. Everyone, from the president on down, is voicing their opinions, fears and feelings. If we all did our best to communicate openly, without prejudice or malice, maybe this terrible event could have been avoided.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone must try to understand why people think and feel the way they do. Many opinions are based on personal experiences. Sadly, most are based on bad experiences, of their own, or the tales of others. We all have to learn to look at the whole picture. Don't assume that you know what others are thinking. I get it. When young black men see someone react in a certain way toward them, the assumption is that they are being profiled. Maybe they are. But it also happens to young whites and Hispanics and those of Arabic descent. The list goes on. You can't let one experience cloud your judgement on the next. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If every one of us made an effort to show our true selves, to smile at others, to be polite, to be courteous, or whatever it takes to prove that you can't be stereotyped, maybe you could actually be responsible for saving a young man like Trayvon. Your actions and behavior toward others could be the one moment that opens their eyes to another possibility. If someone's next actions are based on an experience they just had with you, maybe the next person will benefit from your efforts, and you will be making a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you can't make someone think better of others, at least don't be the one who made them think worse. Try to be the high point of someone's day, not the low point. Who knows? The next person they encounter may be someone you know, or care about.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again the United States is wrestling with the agony of racism. The verdict in the Trayvon Martin case stands as a dividing line between people of color and white residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And once again, we are told that in order to resolve our differences we must have a serious conversation about racism. Presumably, such a discussion would afford blacks the opportunity to tell whites about the indignities they endure in an effort to change white attitudes and behavior. I've spent the last 25 years organizing such conversations in our region, but I'm skeptical about their ability to fundamentally change people's attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's why: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black people have been telling their stories to white people for decades. There is voluminous evidence substantiating racial discrimination in our society. Local, state and federal courts and agencies have issued decisions aimed at redressing inequities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations, organizations and individuals have paid tens of millions of dollars in penalties for their illegal behavior, yet discrimination continues. Adding insult to injury, last month the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated a critical section of the Voting Rights Act, rejecting thousands of pages of testimony on abuses and the will of four Congresses that reauthorized the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't need more statistics confirming racial inequality in our society. What we need is more compassion and, most of all, believability among whites that people of color are regularly subjected to discriminatory behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many whites lack empathy and understanding about people of color. They don't live in dilapidated inner cities like Detroit, where it takes an hour for the police to respond to a 911 call. Nor do they send their children to struggling inner city schools - schools that are more segregated today than before the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision. Many don't have to work in low-paying dead-end service jobs without pensions, sick days and paid vacations. And they don't have to endure longer prison terms for the same offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I used to buy into the white shibboleth that low black and Latino voter turnout was because they didn't care enough to vote. Then came the election of 2000 and the Supreme Court decision that deprived Floridians of their right to decide the election for themselves. I believed the popular mythology about America being &quot;the land of the free and the home of the brave,&quot; a place where anyone can excel if he is industrious and law-abiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now I know that voter suppression is not just a term used by disgruntled people of color. The courts have found numerous instances of fraud and devious attempts to abridge their voting rights. Why are voting records being purged in Florida when only a handful of fraudulent ballots have been found? Why did the governor shorten the number of early election days last year? Why are the governor and attorney general obstructing the restoration of voting rights to felons who have served their time? If we truly believe in the right to vote, why don't we hold polls open seven days a week for a month to accommodate everyone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enormous changes have taken place in our society since the civil rights era, but ask our first president of color how many threats and insults he hasendured, and how difficult it has been to reach consensus with a white-dominated party that may be headed for oblivion. Check the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center and see the increase in the number of hate groups since he was elected: more than 1,000 nationwide, with 59 in Florida. There are more than 60,000 hate websites on the Internet, and the level of racial discourse on some blogs is beneath contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What scares some white people is the writing on the wall: In 30 years they will be the minority in this country, and 10 years after that one of every three people will be Latino. Are they afraid of retribution and retaliation for their behavior and indifference?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I still believe it is important to share our stories with one another, but talk alone will not solve the racial divide. It is a first step, but political action involving coalitions from diverse ethnic groups demanding an end to discrimination in every sector of our society is a necessary second step. The peaceful demonstrations protesting the Zimmerman verdict and use of social media may be the beginning of an American Spring. Together, we must pursue social justice in our courts and the Legislature until we fulfill the promise of a nation &quot;with liberty and justice for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">H. Roy Kaplan was an adviser to President Bill Clinton's Task Force on Racism, &quot;One America.&quot; He was the executive director of the Tampa Bay chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. He teaches courses on racism at the University of South Florida. His latest book is &quot;The Myth of Post-Racial America,&quot; and he wrote this column exclusively for the Tampa Bay Times.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Dream Defenders want a law that repeals &quot;stand your ground&quot; and addresses racial profiling.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the young activists known as the Dream Defenders marched into Gov. Rick Scott's office last week, few observers expected the group to attract much attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven days later, they've proved hard to ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What began as a modest protest has morphed into a weeklong occupation of the Florida Capitol. The organizers, most of whom are college students and young professionals, say they are prepared to stay for weeks or even months - as long as it takes for Scott to call a special session on racial profiling and the state's controversial &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind that Scott has refused, making the odds of a special session almost nonexistent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stay until we win,&quot; said Gabriel Pendas, one of the group's co-founders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past week, the Dream Defenders have emerged as a well-organized coalition with the keen ability to remain in the news cycle. On Tuesday, they announced plans to hold weekly demonstrations in the Florida Capitol, a strategy akin to the Moral Monday protests taking place in North Carolina. The Dream Defenders news conference was broadcast live on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the Dream Defenders may not be able to win a special session, but they may succeed in prompting legislative action through another route. Sen. Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, is calling for a hearing on the &quot;stand your ground'' law during the Legislature's next committee week in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic leaders in the House are onboard with the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The kids have the right idea taking it right to the governor,&quot; said House Minority Leader Perry Thurston, also of Fort Lauderdale. &quot;We're trying to have a compromise by having a common-sense conversation addressing those issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dream Defenders began their protest July 16, three days after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activists are calling for legislation in Martin's name that would repeal the existing &quot;stand your ground'' law, address racial profiling and eliminate zero-tolerance policies in schools. The group has taken an organized approach to the occupation that they say is sustainable for the next several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking a cue from Occupy Wall Street, they have formed a half-dozen committees with different responsibilities. One committee is tasked with community outreach. Another handles meals and sleeping arrangements. A separate team makes sure everyone is exercising, resting and staying clean. Meals are an organized affair. Group members keeps tab on when food was donated and make an effort to eat the perishables first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have everything we need,&quot; Dream Defenders director Phillip Agnew said. &quot;It's not like we're comfortable, but it's not supposed to be comfortable. We could stay here easily for the next few weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Capitol police have no plans to ask the Dream Defenders to leave, Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger said Tuesday. So far, there have been no dust-ups with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The costs to the state have been adding up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FDLE has spent about $37,000 in overtime for police officers at the Capitol, Plessinger said. And the FDLE's Tallahassee regional operational office has spent an additional $5,000 in management costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dream Defenders themselves have had a few hiccups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the group received a letter from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services saying it had not filed the necessary paperwork to solicit cash and in-kind donations. It may be facing fines. It submitted the application Tuesday, Dream Defenders legal and policy director Ahmad Abuznaid said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has also had to deflect allegations that it is pursuing a union-driven agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The property services workers' union 32BJ SEIU pays Agnew $29,000 annually to run the Dream Defenders. And Pendas was on the union payroll for several months last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both deny that the union created the Dream Defenders or has any control over the group's mission or policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To say that some union is masterminding us is an insult,&quot; Agnew said. &quot;Give a little more credit to the youth of Florida.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric Brakken, the union's leader in Florida, said the Dream Defenders are independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agnew said his group has not received any donations from labor unions or any other political organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since we started, our budget has basically been zero,&quot; Agnew said, noting that all of the other young staff members are volunteers, and most of the in-kind donations have come from individuals and local churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agnew said the week had been a learning experience for the year-old organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People can try to bring us down,&quot; he said. &quot;But we're not going anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Richard Carlson, R-St. Marys, brought a new self-defense bill to the Legislature in 2006 meant to clarify residents' rights to take potentially deadly action when they feel threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill was modeled after a law passed in Florida the year before and was passed along to Carlson by the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a firm believer in the right of self-defense, and Kansas didn't have any statutes on self-defense other than a basic common law 'Castle Doctrine' about defending yourself and your home,&quot; Carlson said Tuesday when recalling his role. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, and others like it, would later become known nationally as &quot;Stand Your Ground,&quot; alluding to a line lifted from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Tom Hawk, D-Manhattan, who was then in the House, said he had some apprehensions about the bill, but remembered it passing fairly easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To my recollection there was not a thorough discussion of the downside,&quot; Hawk said Tuesday. &quot;Most of the discussion that was presented was more the points made for it. (Specifically) that people that were in a difficult situation defending their property were not able to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the years since, similar &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws have passed in more than 20 states, spread by the NRA and the American Legislative Exchange Council, which adopted much of the Florida law's language in a piece of model legislation called the &quot;Castle Doctrine Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such laws have become the target of renewed scrutiny following the acquittal of Florida neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates for changing the Kansas law concede that such efforts are unlikely to succeed in a state in which the conservative Legislature passed basically everything on the NRA's agenda this past session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rep. Gail Finney, D-Wichita, said she feels compelled to try because the current law &quot;has so many loopholes&quot; that defendants could take advantage of in cases in which self-defense is murky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It needs to be looked at and reviewed very closely,&quot; Finney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wouldn't be the first time the Legislature has revisited the 2006 law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Florida law, the Kansas law states that residents have no duty to attempt to retreat when they believe their health or their property is threatened, and instead are justified in meeting force with force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Kansas law as originally written differed from the Florida law in a few key ways, according to an article published in the 2008 KU Law Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't include a &quot;reasonableness requirement&quot; when evaluating the threat to the residents standing their ground. It also didn't provide guidance on when the use of &quot;deadly force&quot; was justified by people standing their ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article's author, Annie Wells, called the Kansas law &quot;unclear and ambiguous&quot; and said it was difficult to predict its effects. Wells wrote that the law didn't clearly define what sort of &quot;attack&quot; would justify use of force in response, noting that the dictionary definition of the word includes verbal barrages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said the law provided little guidance on whether the force used to defend oneself had to be proportionate to the threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For example, if someone is punched in the face, can he respond by attacking with a gun or knife?&quot; Wells wrote. &quot;The answer is unclear under the current statutory language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawk said he had similar questions about the breadth of the law when it was proposed, including whether it could be used as a defense if a vehicle owner killed someone he thought was stealing his car, only to find out later the vehicle was being lawfully repossessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just seemed like it opened up those kind of 'what ifs,' &quot; Hawk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlson said most of those concerns have been addressed with a 2010 amendment that tied &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; to previous statutes that included a reasonableness requirement and a clarification that the use of deadly force is permitted to prevent &quot;imminent death or great bodily harm&quot; to oneself or an innocent third party, but not necessarily in protection of unattended property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically, it means that whenever you honestly believe you have an immediate threat of great bodily harm, you can use up to deadly force,&quot; Carlson said. &quot;Of course, all of that would have to be sorted out by the court system and the investigating officers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlson said the Legislature is constantly working to polish and update laws, but he is &quot;not in favor of looking at anything to lower the standard for right of self-defense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finney said she remains worried about the effect of &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; in places where people who look a certain way are considered more threatening than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finney and other African-American leaders spoke at a rally  attended by about 200 people last week in Wichita. She said Tuesday she hoped the renewed discussions about &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; also might spur a larger conversation about race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've often spoke about racial profiling in Kansas,&quot; Finney said. &quot;The problem is really prevalent throughout Kansas, and it seems like it often fell on deaf ears.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we all saw, President Obama talked about what happened in Florida, absorbing national attention over what is a local issue. Every day that the press allows him to pull a Bill Clinton and say, &quot;I feel your pain&quot; without a challenge is a day he gets to ignore dealing with the fact that we have 21 million people who are unemployed and eight million people who can only find part-time work. The country is 14 million jobs short of where it should be and has a real unemployment rate of more than 13 percent. Even with the government's cooked books, the youth unemployment rate is 24 percent, and the African-American unemployment rate is more than 13 percent. Every day that the press allows a cynical charade like this to go unchallenged is a day that President Obama doesn't have to face tens of millions of Americans out of work or underemployed, that he has presided over a scandalous $300 billion-a-year trade deficit with China, that businesses are refusing to expand beyond 50 employees and are limiting employees to only working fewer than 30 hours per week because of &quot;Obamacare.&quot; Every day that the press plays along with the farce of treating Treyvon (Trayvon) Martin like some modern Medgar Evers is a day that the worst president economically since Herbert Hoover doesn't have to face the music.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every now and then, something truly historic occurs. President Obama's surprise visit Friday to the White House briefing room to offer remarks on race was such a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has treaded lightly throughout his career this issue. Because he speaks of race so infrequently, his words and experience carry extra weight when he chooses to go there. Friday, one could sense the burden he felt as he offered the country heartfelt views born of personal experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama was asking Americans to see the Zimmerman case through a different lens. He said, &quot;It's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this through a set of experiences and a history that -- that doesn't go away.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black context</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is this experience and history? The president spoke in deeply personal terms about how it feels to live in a society that looks at you as a criminal when you have done nothing more than be a black man. He lamented a justice system that likely would not have extended the same benefit of doubt to Trayvon&nbsp;Martin that George Zimmerman received. I'll add that if Martin had Zimmerman's record -- an arrest for violence against a police officer and a restraining order for domestic violence -- there is no question he would have been arrested on the spot and cast as a dangerous thug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many white Americans don't want to hear this. They prefer to pretend that justice is blind and racism is ancient history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never mind that there are African Americans alive today who grew up under segregation and another generation who grew up hearing about it from their parents. If Emmett Till had not been tortured and murdered at age 14 by two white men (who were later acquitted) he'd be just shy of his 72nd birthday. This is not ancient history. When the president said &quot;there's a lot of pain&quot; in the African-American community over the Zimmerman verdict, he was being typically understated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative anger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;the Zimmerman case was not about race&quot; is the claim emanating from conservatives angry about Obama's remarks. This is absurd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've been told that the reason Zimmerman was angry and spitting expletives when he called the police was because there had been burglaries by young black men in the neighborhood. So how was Martin's race not a factor? The fact that the mostly white jury heard this and still believed race was not relevant is unfortunately not particularly surprising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just exactly how bad are white Americans at seeing racism against African Americans? The Grio website ran a story with this sobering flashback: &quot;In 1963, almost two-thirds of white Americans told Gallup that blacks were treated equally in their communities in regard to employment, housing and education. And in 1962, 94% said black children had just as good a chance to get a good education as white children.&quot; This, despite the fact that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not yet law and only became law over the objections of viciously racist politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's parents expressed gratitude for Obama's comments, saying that the president &quot;sees himself in Trayvon and identifies with him.&quot; Perhaps Obama's remarks will help more Americans -- regardless of their race -- to do the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been hard on President Obama for his reluctance to speak out about race in America. And, I hasten to add, some of his most ardent supporters have been hard on me for pressing him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is with certain pride, and relief, that I applaud him for speaking out the way he did Friday. Striding unannounced into a White House briefing room, Obama delivered a message from the heart that may well change the way this nation talks about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son,&quot; Obama remarked. &quot;Another way of saying that is Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging our collective pain - that's how Nelson Mandela began the healing process after the collapse of racial apartheid in South Africa. Truth and reconciliation always begin with an embrace of suffering and a summoning of what Obama referred to as &quot;the better angels of our nature,&quot; echoing Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is never easy, but Obama has boldly held up a spiritual and intellectual light to guide us through the anguished aftermath of the Martin killing. Trayvon, an unarmed 17-year-old youth, had been racially profiled, stalked as a burglary suspect and eventually gunned down by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. Responding to anger over the recent acquittal of George Zimmerman, Obama stepped forward in a spontaneous, unscripted attempt to turn chaos into community through understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these 'stand your ground' laws, I'd just ask people to consider, if Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk?&quot; Obama asked. &quot;And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the answer is not ambiguous in the least. Trayvon would have been arrested immediately and more than likely held without bond. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama also put out a call to action for African Americans in particular - and as any black churchgoer can tell you, such a call always requires a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys,&quot; Obama said. &quot;And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about. . . . And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reference to his wife, Michelle, brings to mind that powerful image of the Obamas as  America's first family - an African American mother and father raising two daughters, Malia and Sasha. Who else but parents can really give a child a sense that they are cared for  and valued?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question Obama asked, however, is what can the country do? Not much, apparently. At least not now. &quot;I'm not naive about the prospects of some grand, new federal program,&quot; the president said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Obama did point out that finding solutions to the crisis facing African American men and boys is &quot;a long-term project&quot; that will require a new level of political sophistication. Here we are more than a decade into the 21st century,  and we're still relying on 1960s-era protest politics to air our grievances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could fault Obama for waiting so long to speak out. I could say he sounded too much like young Barry and too little like the president, that he had no executive decisions to announce. But right now, I'm just impressed that he spoke out at all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars,&quot; Obama said. &quot;That happens to me, at least before I was a senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama demurs. The bullet holes that appeared in the balcony off the White House family room back in 2011 did not come from the click of a lock on a car door. They came from a high-powered rifle. The kind of poisonous mind-set that contributed to the murder of civil rights advocates Medgar Evers and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. lives on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make no mistake about it: His speaking out required courage, and it was simply refreshing to see our first black president show some backbone in discussing race for a change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racial issues vary with time and place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama spoke eloquently and extemporaneously about race from the White House press room on Friday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was reminded of a debate during the presidential primary in 2000 between Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Vice President Al Gore from the Apollo Theatre in Harlem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradley, a Rhodes scholar and former professional basketball player for the New York Knicks, challenged the audience in the theater and watching on TV to talk about race to people of another race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was living in Washington, D.C., at that time, working as a registered nurse with coworkers and patients of many varied ethnicities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One conversation I have never forgotten was with an African American man who grew up in the north but went to spend a summer with his grandparents in the south when he was a teen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father sat him down and told him the story of Emmett Till, who was killed for smiling at a white girl in the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father told him how he had to be very careful of every move he might make during his stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had an amazing and for me an enlightening conversation. I believe that Bradley was right.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama feeds media's take on black violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon Martin was physically beating George Zimmerman, a factor justifying the response that caused Martin's death (with or without the stand-your-ground law).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday President Barack Obama asked us to consider if stand-your-ground laws would have justified Martin killing Zimmerman because Martin was followed and felt threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such rhetorical accommodation of black violence justified by non-violent offenses perceived against black Americans is predominant in our media. Shame on Obama for honoring it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clean Lakes Alliance, fireworks an odd match</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am disappointed by the plans to detonate fireworks from barges on Lake Monona in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday's article indicated that the Clean Lakes Alliance will be a charitable beneficiary of the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why would an organization promoting the health of the Madison lakes agree to profit from an event that will add toxic pollution and debris to Lake Monona?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This calls into question the priorities of the organization. Are they interested more in cleaning up the lakes or in raising funds?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to see the CLA do more with the generous budget they have generated through corporate and private donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Journal has featured the upcoming Clean Lakes Festival, and surely the CLA has contributed to ongoing dialog about clean water, but our lakes deserve more than fireworks and festivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CLA has done a good job of getting their name out there through fundraising initiatives, but perhaps they need to refocus their human and monetary resources on more beneficial and meaningful actions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will zoo animals be disturbed by fireworks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's ask the people who run the zoo how they feel about having the fireworks over Lake Monona. Will it disturb the animals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it would be better to activate those fireworks from the Olbrich Park area of the lake rather than the middle of the lake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations help in dealing with dementia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to add a few points to your thoughtful Tuesday editorial &quot;Dementia studies connect dots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dementia does not only affect the elderly. Younger onset dementia affects people in their prime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My husband was diagnosed at 64. He had been determined to have adult attention deficit disorder at 58.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doctor even considered administering cognitive tests then to determine whether he might have mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It never occurred to any of us because he was so young. So &quot;when in doubt, check it out&quot; is good advice for all ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are fortunate to have the Alzheimer's and Dementia Alliance of Wisconsin. It offers an array of programs and services designed to help families throughout the dementia process, which our family calls &quot;the journey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My husband and I enrolled in the Crossing Bridges program soon after he was diagnosed in 2010. It was immensely helpful in understanding the variations and stages of dementia, and offered tools and techniques I used to become the best caregiver I could be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Younger Onset Caregiver Support group and Sons and Daughters of Memory Caf&Atilde;&copy; provide a base for younger folks who are coping with the disease. There is nothing like sharing time, experiences and ideas with people in similar situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You do not have to go it alone. The journey provides opportunities for personal growth and discovery, and the Alliance is an invaluable friend in time of need.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunter, who is white, said her fiance, who is black, will be followed and questioned when they walk in a store. She said she never experienced racism until she started dating someone of a different race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also has read the comments about the killing of Trayvon Martin and the jury's acquittal of the shooter, George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a shame to know we live in such a racist community,&quot; she said after a community forum Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum, hosted by the hosted by the York NAACP and the Black Ministers' Association, involved a community discussion about racial profiling, the killing of youths and the attack on Constitutional Rights at the Crispus Attucks Community Center in York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 21/2 hour discussion attended by more than 50 people also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved classism, gender and how no one is perfect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My question on this to everybody is: ... What are we going to do about it?&quot; Hunter said. &quot;When you see a racial injustice or something, do you speak on it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some participants described how they witnessed defendants being treated differently based on race. Some talked about social issues, such as how the state is spending more money on prisons than education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants talked about the importance of taking steps, such as voting and serving on a jury if called.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Darnell Bowman, pastor of Unity Church of God in Christ in York, said racism is real, and it doesn't matter that he is a pastor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somehow, we've got to make a difference,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got to make the difference in ourselves, and in the way we train our children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesia Richards of York said what gets her fired up is that people see somebody walking down the street and that person is assumed to be the bad guy. And that person is not, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like Michael Jackson said: Look at the man in the mirror,&quot; she said. &quot;It starts with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 26, 2012, Zimmerman followed Martin as he walked to the home of his father's girlfriend. Words were exchanged and, after a struggle, Zimmerman shot Martin in the chest and claimed self defense in accordance with Florida's stand your ground laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thompson, president of the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said she didn't watch the trial because she already figured Zimmerman would be cleared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defense did their job, but the prosecution didn't do their job,&quot; she said. &quot;And the police department didn't do their job when Zimmerman wasn't charged immediately (after the shooting).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution finally charged Zimmerman for the shooting six weeks later because of public outcry, Thompson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there has been public outrage over the verdict, many people aren't surprised by the jury's decision because they believe the American justice system is not fair to black males and does not value their lives, Thompson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What to tell kids? Sam Beard, a black York City resident, said he is raising two grandsons and wondered how to explain the Zimmerman case to them. Beard also said he's afraid for them as they grow up, especially after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wonder how can I explain to my boys that they're just as good and can go just as far as anyone else, but if you're stopped by police, you have to become subservient because it's a matter of life or death,&quot; Beard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audience also discussed the need for groups to come together to list and resolve local racial, economic and crime issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members also talked about personal experiences with racism and about working through their own prejudices and stereotypes they have based on how people dress, especially with hoodies, oversized clothing and sagging pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Shaffer, the Democratic Party of York County vice chairwoman, said she was a little scared when she saw two boys - they were white - walking down the street in Hanover with their pants sagging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I held on to my steering wheel,&quot; said Shaffer, who is also white. &quot;But I thought, 'Lazy bums. Are you going up there to buy some drugs?' I wanted to yell, 'Pull your pants up!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Need for plan: Elder Eugene Brown, pastor of True Bread Community Church in York City, said parents and church, city and community leaders need to develop a strategic plan of action for dealing with injustices and with youth issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men also need to get involved to guide younger males in the right direction and to help meet needs in their communities, said Brown, a BMA member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All males need to rise up and take charge of the community,&quot; Brown said. &quot;We cannot remain silent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The York Chapter of the NAACP meets at 6:30 p.m. the fourth Tuesday of each month at Crispus Attucks Community Center, 605 Duke St. in York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the &quot;Stand Up For Your Community&quot; group will hold its summer meetings outside in York City. During the meetings, information will be shared about local activities designed to improve residents' quality of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meetings are at 5 p.m. on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**July 25 at the corner of West Princess and West streets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**Aug. 22, East Prospect Street and College Avenue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">**Sept. 26, South Queen and South streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case of rain, the meetings will be held at Lincoln Charter School, 559 W. King St.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after 1 p.m. Monday, Michelle Nunn declared herself a Democratic candidate in the 2014 race for U.S. Senate, the very seat once held by her father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's to file the proper papers today. &quot;I'm excited about it,&quot; Nunn said in an exclusive interview. &quot;I've learned that you can't wait for somebody else to do it. Everybody has an individual role and a responsibility to contribute where they can. This seems like a way for me to contribute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nunn, 46, said she intends to make the nation's finances and deficit reduction a key focus of her campaign, picking up where U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss leaves off. Chambliss, a Republican who retires next year after serving two terms, has played a central role in the so-far unsuccessful &quot;Gang of Eight&quot; effort to craft a deal to reduce the $17 trillion federal debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nunn is a first-time political candidate facing steep odds. Even so, her entry has been anticipated for months, and is sure to turn Georgia into a 2014 battleground state, unleashing millions of dollars in campaign contributions and super PAC expenditures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans hold every statewide office in Georgia, but understand that the state's rapidly changing demographics ultimately threaten that hold. To Democrats, the Georgia contest represents one of only two potential Senate pick-ups in 2014. The other is Kentucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race here could determine whether Democrats retain control of the chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nunn isn't the only Democratic candidate in the Senate contest. Branko Radulovacki, an Atlanta physician, has already announced. Former state Sen. Steen Miles of DeKalb County is considering a run. But Nunn, with a last name that bespeaks Georgia centrism, is the candidate most Democrats with money will bet on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the stakes, Nunn's announcement was surprisingly low-key. We were alone --- save for an aide on her side and a photographer on mine --- in a booth at the Thumbs Up Diner on Marietta Street in Atlanta, around the corner from the Points of Light Foundation that Nunn founded. Points of Light is a legacy operation of President George H.W. Bush that promotes volunteerism. Nunn has built it from one employee to 130.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four Republicans are already in the contest, pushing the conversation ever rightward. Even as she anticipated a GOP onslaught that would begin at daybreak, Nunn said she would be aiming for the middle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our opportunity is to define ourselves,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm going to talk a lot about the deficit. Neither side of the equation is really tackling that. I think people are really tired of the mudslinging and the silliness of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next several weeks, she'll be traveling the state in a mini-van, with her two kids (ages 10 and 8) and husband in tow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nunn has already shown herself to be different from other white Democrats --- i.e., Roy Barnes and John Barrow --- in Georgia. In May, she attended a fundraiser featuring President Barack Obama. Last week, Nunn had a prominent role at a White House ceremony honoring her foundation --- and its sponsor, the first President Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of what I bring to the table, and what Georgians are eager for, is coming together. They're tired of the partisanship, tired of what feels like political infighting versus actually trying to accomplish things,&quot; Nunn said. &quot;I've had the chance to work with President George H.W. Bush. I sat on a council on volunteerism for George W. Bush. I believe in showing respect for our presidents across party lines. I think we do a disservice when we're not willing to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nunn will come under immediate pressure to weigh in on issues of the day. She tackled a few on Monday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare: &quot;It's difficult for small businesses. I think there are things that are not working with ACA. That's something that needs to be changed,&quot; she said. But Nunn's emphasis was on fixing health care reform, not eliminating it. She also pointed out that, by rejecting an expansion of Medicaid under the new law, Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of health care coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On gay marriage: Nunn said she agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court decision that left the definition of marriage to the individual states. &quot;I also believe that marriage is not only a legal construct, but a sacrament, and every religious institution has to be able to define it for themselves,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on a personal level, Nunn said she favors marriage equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the George Zimmerman acquittal in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin: &quot;First and foremost, it's a terrible tragedy,&quot; she said. &quot;We lost a young man --- really, a child. We need to grapple as a society with the moral issues. When I was at church yesterday, one of our elders said this is a conversation we need to be having.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Nunn's issues will echo loudly of her father, Sam Nunn. Throughout his 24 years in the Senate, which immediately followed the end of the U.S. military draft, Sam Nunn worried about a shrinking sense of citizenship in America. His daughter is of the same mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stanley McChrystal (the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan) recently came out and said we can't let only our military men and women, 1 percent of our population, carry the burden of securing the country,&quot; Michelle Nunn said. &quot;He's called for a million young people to commit to national service. That's not calling for federal funding. It's talking about a private-public partnership. That's one of the things I'll be talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About that famous father of hers. Sam Nunn's office, like his daughter's, is only a stone throw away from the Thumbs Up Diner. The former senator, who is closing in on 75, remains active on the world stage, particularly when it comes to the issue of nuclear proliferation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think you'll see him. He's in great shape. This is my campaign, but he'll be supportive in every way,&quot; his daughter said. She hinted that part of her father's job will be to keep his tongue in check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember talking to George H.W. Bush, who said it was much harder to watch his son suffer through the slings and arrows than to endure them himself,&quot; Michelle Nunn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with that, Nunn left the booth to inform her Points of Lights board that she would be stepping aside &quot;for the duration.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 20, I called for gatherings at the steps of the Augusta Judicial Center and John H. Ruffin Jr. Courthouse, and at Williams Memorial C.M.E. Church. Other leaders shared in major roles for both events for Trayvon Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The George Zimmerman trial has caused a divide in communities across the nation. However, I am saddened that both families will feel the pain for some time to come. Nevertheless, this does not change what could have been avoided, had the right choice been made to know where one's rights begin and end. Don't you think our laws need to be changed or modified - so those who make them, those who carry them out and those who must abide by them will understand and have no question as to their function?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have no problem with going to Sanford, Fla., nor to Jena, La., to stand by the Jena Six. But I am concerned that on the heels of this national movement and before this is over for good, we have had three young African-Americans killed just this past weekend and others killed in our very own back yard. We will have vigils for them, and I have led and shared with many. But after the demonstrations and vigils, what will we do? In Chicago, more than 500 were killed last year and about 200 so far this year. Why are no buses of protesters going up there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the lives of black men and women are important also. Therefore, I call for the reactivation of Augustans Together, the organization that promoted racial and ethnic harmony. We need to foster change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, shot and killed an unarmed 17-year-old, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, in Sanford, Florida on February 26, 2012.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has garnered controversy worldwide as George, a Hispanic American, was accused by protestors of racially profiling Trayvon, who is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution tried the case as criminal profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie, who portrayed the titular character, a former slave, in Quentin Tarantino's historic spaghetti western Django Unchained, is upset by the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a father himself and the star empathises with the deep pain that comes with the loss of a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First of all, I was disappointed like everyone else,&quot; he told Extra at Comic-Con in San Diego. &quot;I was crushed because I have a personal relationship with his mom and his father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people across America have protested against the court's decision to release Zimmerman after his acquittal was announced July 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie is in awe over how race relations are still even part of the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Trayvon's mom, Sybrina Fulton] never made it about race,&quot; he explained. &quot;She only said, 'My 17-year-old kid could be your 17-year-old kid.' Something the world could embrace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie believes people should remain &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;peaceful&quot; about how they express their frustration over the situation, as he does not support race riots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z joined Trayvon's mother and the Reverend Al Sharpton at a protest in New York City on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the event Ms. Fulton made it clear she won't stop seeking justice for Trayvon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I promise you I'm going to work for your children as well,&quot; she told the crowd. &quot;Today it was my son. Tomorrow it might be yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - George Zimmerman helped rescue four people from an overturned vehicle in central Florida last week, just days after he was cleared of all charges in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, officials said Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seminole County Sheriff's spokeswoman Kim Cannaday said in a statement that deputies responding last Wednesday afternoon to the wreck in Sanford - the Orlando suburb where Martin was shot - found Zimmerman and another man had already helped a couple and their two children out of a flipped SUV off the road near Interstate 4. They were not hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, 29, spoke with a deputy at the scene and then left, the sheriff's office statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not see the crash happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed to be the first time Zimmerman, 29, has been seen publicly since his acquittal on a second-degree murder charge in the 17-year-old Martin's death in February 2012. Zimmerman's parents and his attorneys have said in interviews since the verdict that they fear for his safety because of those who may not agree with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A message left at the office of Zimmerman attorney Mark O'Mara was not immediately returned Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Zimmerman, Jr. on Monday posted on his Twitter account about his brother's actions: &quot;George saw a need, he acted. Our parents taught us to help, never to boast. Humility is George's finest trait.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin's shooting death spurred debate across the U.S. over racial profiling, self-defense and equal justice. Protesters nationwide lashed out against police in Sanford because it took 44 days for Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, to be arrested last year. Many, including Martin's parents, said Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen. Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, said he acted in self-defense during a fight with Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six female jurors, whose names have not been released, considered nearly three weeks of often wildly conflicting testimony over who was the aggressor on the rainy night Martin was shot while walking through the gated townhouse community where he was staying and where Zimmerman lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acquittal prompted rallies nationwide in the days afterward calling for a civil rights investigation and federal charges against Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also led to a sit-in at Florida Gov. Rick Scott's office demanding that legislators repeal the state's stand-your-ground self-defense law. The law, passed in 2005, generally eliminated a person's duty to retreat in the face of a serious physical threat. At least 21 states have a self-defense law similar to Florida's.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I have raised you right, you should have felt a sadness, a pinch, a gut check, an anger, a hurt when that verdict was read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old boy, was senselessly killed. Yes, that hurts. It should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman, the man who shot him, was acquitted by a jury of six women in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A boy lost his life. And our criminal justice system made no acknowledgement that a wrong occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know the prosecution had an uphill battle to make a case in the land of Stand Your Ground. But this we know: Trayvon had bought Skittles and iced tea at a convenience store. He was walking back to where he was staying when Zimmerman followed him and ended up in a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than repeat the rules you've heard from those who love you about how you should behave if you ever find yourself in a similar situation (because, hopefully, you know that survival matters most), let me say what we know in our hearts to be true:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That man should not have assumed Trayvon was a criminal because of how he was dressed or because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should not have ignored the 911 dispatcher, who said he did not need to follow the teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He should not have taken the law into his own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of that was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's OK to feel outraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's OK to feel scared for a moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anything man-made is imperfect. Our laws, our government, our justice system can never be completely fair. And if you look anything like Trayvon or have ever been looked at with suspicion simply for what and who you are, you know that better than most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know how that look feels. I have hoped that you will never learn how that look feels, but odds are that you will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger. Fear. Resentment. These are powerful emotions. They can paralyze us. Or they can call us to action. They are never justification for resignation or apathy or violence. Despite what louder voices might try to say, our country is not where it was 100 or 50 years ago. We will not discount the progress that has been made, the battles that have been fought and won. Many more friendships and families exist more easily, with more respect; that may not have been possible mere decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anytime we bear witness to injustice, it is a reminder of how great our responsibility is, and that each of us has a role to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look in the mirror. You may wear a hoodie. You might share Trayvon's features or color. Or you may not look a thing like him. It doesn't matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are familiar with the saying that the arc of the moral universe is long but that it bends toward justice. Decades later, then-Sen. Barack Obama added, &quot;It does not bend on its own. It bends because each of us in our own ways put our hand on that arc and we bend it in the direction of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where are your hands on that arc?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read. Read even more. Educate yourself. Make your voice heard. Call your elected officials. When you are able, vote. Work to help elect those who you believe will make things more fair. Stand up to bigotry when you hear it. Challenge assumptions when those around you make them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And take a minute to feel what a teenager being questioned, followed and confronted by an unidentified man with a gun might have felt in the moments before he was shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the anger and hurt, injustice is meant to remind us of our own power. It is the most stark reminder that our worth is not derived from others' assessments of us. It is intrinsic to you as a human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know that you belong. You know your own value and worth, just as I know mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I still don't feel right inside about what happened with Trayvon or the man who killed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think we ever should.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) -- New England's electric grid operator says last week's stretch of excessive heat and humidity pushed weekend power use to an eight-year high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISO-New England said Monday that preliminary data show that 24,653 megawatts were used on Saturday, a record for a weekend day. The previous record was 24,065 megawatts on Aug. 13, 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, demand was fourth-highest, with demand for 27,377 megawatts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record for electricity use was 28,130 megawatts on Aug. 2, 2006. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokeswoman Marcia Blomberg said ISO-New England asked businesses on Friday to reduce power to help cut demand. Businesses that agree in advance to cut electricity do so when requested by the Holyoke-based power grid operator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call for power reduction is rare. Blomberg said companies were asked in January, but were never called on last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONTPELIER (AP) -- If you're unlucky in the Vermont moose permit lottery drawing Aug. 1, here's another chance with better odds, but it will cost you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunters wanting a chance in the lottery had to buy a ticket by July 5 for the chance to purchase one of 355 moose hunting permits being made available this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That drawing is Aug. 1, but anyone who's unlucky there has another opportunity to enter an auction for one of five additional moose permits being distributed by that method.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minimum auction bid is $1,500, and winners usually enter bids topping $4,000. The auction deadline is Aug. 21.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOSTON (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is questioning the wisdom of so-called &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if Zimmerman should face federal civil rights charges in the death of Martin, who was black, Warren said the Justice Department is considering the question, but the jury has spoken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Massachusetts Democrat said the goal should be to create a country &quot;not just where some of us are safe, but where all of our children are safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow Democratic Sen. Edward Markey questioned whether the laws might embolden someone who is armed to pursue an unarmed individual and then fire if that person turns to confront them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it's time to start &quot;paring back&quot; the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massachusetts doesn't have a stand your ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vermont brothers charged in burglary and assault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARRE (AP) -- Two brothers, including one who is at large and is considered armed and dangerous, are facing charges they threatened to kill a Vermont man and his dog while stealing $1,185 from the victim's Barre apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barre police say 33-year-old David Garneau, of Barre, and 30-year-old Jonathan Garneau, of Williamstown, were charged following the early morning July 13 incident in which a 21-year-old Barre man was assaulted and robbed with a silver and brass pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say the Garneaus were last seen speeding away. Arrest warrants were obtained for both brothers on charges of burglary, aggravated assault and grand larceny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Garneau has since been arrested. He's being held on $50,000 bail. It's unclear if he has a lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Garneau has not been apprehended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Shaheen outlines measures against sexual assault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen says using the expertise of the University of New Hampshire's National Criminal Justice Center to train military officers and first responders will have an impact in the fight against sexual assaults in the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen joined law enforcement officials and military personnel Monday at UNH for a roundtable discussion on efforts to improve sexual assault prevention. She outlined provisions she included in the National Defense Authorization Act to address sexual abuse prevention, including a measure to use resources at law centers like UNH's training center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision introduced by Shaheen, a member of the Armed Services Committee, requests a comprehensive review from the Department of Defense for the coordination and incorporation of civilian law enforcement best practices in sexual assault prevention and response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a responsibility to act,&quot; said Shaheen, who was joined by members of the New Hampshire National Guard and the Dover Police Department. &quot;The Department of Defense has had a zero tolerance policy on sexual assault for over two decades. Yet, we're still having this discussion instead of implementing reforms. If we continue to avoid the fundamental issues, 20 years from now we will find ourselves in the exact same place. We can't let that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 new state troopers in N.H. budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- New Hampshire State Police are working to fill 10 new positions authorized under the recently passed state budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new troopers are expected to be on the road early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget provides for a total of 343 troopers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troopers' union had advocated for more positions during the legislative session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Police are engaged in data analysis to determine how best to deploy the troopers, according to reports. Maj. Russell Conte said the new troopers will go where they will best serve the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bride on honeymoon killed in N.H. crash</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- A man charged with drunk driving is being held on $250,000 bail after police said he crashed into a car driven by a Minnesota couple on their honeymoon in New England, killing the bride and seriously injuring the groom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Killed Saturday on Route 4 in Rollinsford, N.H., was 30-year-old Leah Fonda of St. Paul. Her husband, 30-year-old Brian Preiss of St. Paul, was hospitalized in fair condition Monday at Massachusetts General Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the driver, 43-year-old Matthew Tsopas of Somersworth, fled and was found in Dover, where he was hospitalized. He was arraigned at the hospital on charges of negligent homicide, felony driving under the influence of alcohol and felony conduct after an accident, according to reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preiss's uncle, Chuck Czech of St. Joseph, Minn., said the couple worked at the theme park at the Mall of America. They were friends for a long time and recently became engaged. They got married on July 12 in Bloomington, a few blocks from the mall, and took off for their road trip shortly after that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brian, he's kind of famous for road trips,&quot; Czech said Monday. &quot;As a child he would study maps of the United States, and when he got his license, he and his brother would just hop in the car and go to these places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so Leah became part of that, and so that's how they fashioned their honeymoon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple had planned to go to Boston and then on to Niagara Falls, Czech said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vermont state workers' union reverses chief's firing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONTPELIER (AP) -- The Vermont State Employees' Associated has reinstated its executive director more than a month after he was fired, and two top lawyers with the union have resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The VSEA Board of Directors voted Monday to reinstate Mark Mitchell as executive director after reviewing an independent investigator's findings. The union says it was determined that charges raised against Mitchell earlier did not warrant his dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union said Mitchell had been invited to return immediately to his role as executive director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, two lawyers at the union, General Counsel Michael Casey and Associate General Counsel Abigail Winters, have resigned. No reason for their departures was given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. - George Zimmerman's murder trial is over - but not the legal wrangling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments after the six-member jury found that Zimmerman did not commit a crime when he killed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Circuit Judge Debra S. Nelson told the former Neighborhood Watch volunteer: &quot;You have no further business with the court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nelson has two issues yet to decide: how long to keep juror names a secret, and whether to fine prosecutors for behavior that defense attorneys say was unethical. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other judges are overseeing separate civil cases spawned by the shooting, one by Zimmerman, who accuses NBCUniversal Media of defaming him, and one by his former bodyguards, who allege he owes them $27,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also is the perjury case pending against Zimmerman's wife, Shellie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are details about what to expect:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juror names</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identities of the six women who served as Zimmerman's jury are a secret, thanks to an order by the judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long they will remain so, however, is an open question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Mark O'Mara initially asked that their names be kept under seal permanently, but after more than a dozen media companies objected, Nelson rejected that request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She signed an order ruling that their names would remain secret during the trial. O'Mara, however, asked that that be extended for six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This should be a sufficient amount of time for any community passions to cool, should an acquittal occur,&quot; he wrote in a motion filed June 25, after the jury was sworn in and had begun hearing evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protests began as soon as the verdict was read, and in the week since have spread across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the six jurors, still anonymous, issued a statement July 16 saying, among other things, that they wanted their lives to remain private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also distanced themselves from juror B-37, who appeared on CNN July 15 and 16 and defended Zimmerman and the jury's decision. She also signed with a literary agent but quickly backed out of that deal after being harshly criticized on social media sites and seeing news reports about protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much longer their names will remain private is unclear, but it is not an issue that media companies are expected to abandon. While jurors were deliberating July 13, an attorney for the Sentinel sent the judge a letter asking her to hold a hearing before making a final decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanctions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A debate over whether prosecutors should be sanctioned for allegedly failing to give defense attorneys damaging evidence from Martin's cellphone provided some riveting moments just before the trial began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Don West was on the witness stand June 6 testifying about what happened and was being cross-examined by Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda, the lawyer West accused of malfeasance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We caught you hiding the information and confronted you about it, and you never gave it to us,&quot; West roared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, when O'Mara tried to call de la Rionda to the witness stand, the prosecutor refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your honor, I'm not going to subject myself to ... I think that's improper; I object to it,&quot; de la Rionda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Mara then suggested prosecutors may have committed &quot;direct criminal contempt,&quot; prompting the judge to halt the hearing, move on to another matter and say she would take it up after the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is expected to set a hearing soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defense earlier had called as a witness a co-worker of de la Rionda's, Ben Kruidbos, then-information technology chief for special prosecutor Angela Corey. He said de la Rionda had looked at photos Kruidbos had discovered on Trayvon's phone - including pictures of marijuana plants and a handgun - in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorneys argued that they had not received them until a few days before the trial began June 10. Kruidbos was later fired, according to reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De la Rionda says he did nothing wrong because he gave defense attorneys the source file to Martin's phone, which contains all the data on it - including the photos - in code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawsuits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the trial over, many who follow the case are speculating about lawsuits yet to be filed: Will Martin's parents sue Zimmerman? Will Zimmerman seek damages? But two suits are already pending and will likely ramp up soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one, Zimmerman is suing NBC News alleging defamation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accuses the organization of splicing together two separate portions of his call to police the night of the shooting to make it seem as if he had blurted out that Martin was black. In reality, Zimmerman was merely answering a question from the dispatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit also accuses the network of falsely reporting that during the call, Zimmerman used a racial epithet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Defendants pounced on the Zimmerman/Martin matter because they knew this tragedy could be, with proper sensationalizing and manipulation, a racial powder keg that would result in months, if not years, of topics for their failing news programs,&quot; the suit says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC fired back in February, stating in a court filing that &quot;there is no legitimate basis for Zimmerman's claims against these defendants, who fairly and accurately reported about a news event that has captivated the nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate suit, former bodyguards for Zimmerman are suing him, his wife and O'Mara, alleging they failed to pay $27,000. O'Mara expressed surprise when told of the suit, noting the Zimmerman defense had already paid the company &quot;over $40,000.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman's 26-year-old wife, Shellie, is accused by Corey, the special prosecutor, of lying at her husband's April 20, 2012, bond hearing when she testified that they were broke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, in the days just before that hearing, she had helped transfer half of the $130,000 in donations that had come flooding in from people wanting to help her husband, according to prosecution records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Months ago, defense attorney Kelly Sims and Assistant State Attorney John Guy agreed to wait until George Zimmerman's murder trial was over to move forward with the perjury case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No trial date has been set, but a routine hearing to discuss scheduling is set for Aug. 21. Shellie Zimmerman, a nursing student nearly done with her training, contends she is not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If convicted, she faces a maximum of five years in prison. But that is unlikely, given that she has no previous criminal record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - If President Barack Obama's new focus on the economy sounds familiar, that's because he's done it before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the first year of his presidency, Obama has been launching - and re-launching - initiatives on the economy. Some came with new policy proposals, others with catchy slogans. Remember 2011's &quot;Winning the Future&quot; campaign? Or the &quot;We Can't Wait&quot; initiatives that followed later that year? Just a few months ago, Obama was headlining the &quot;Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far there's no slogan attached to the White House's latest initiative, which kicks off Wednesday in Galesburg, Ill. The president's advisers are billing his remarks as a major address on the economy, though no new initiatives are expected to be announced. However, aides say there will be some fresh policy proposals in a series of follow-up speeches planned through September, most of which will be narrowly targeted on issues such as housing, retirement security and expanding access to education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama's repeated attempts to orient his public agenda on the economy should serve as a reminder that &quot;the president has always been focused on these issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman helped 4 get out of overturned SUV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, Fla. - George Zimmerman helped rescue four people from an overturned vehicle in central Florida last week, just days after he was cleared of all charges in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, officials said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seminole County Sheriff's spokeswoman Kim Cannaday said in a statement that deputies responding last Wednesday afternoon to the wreck in Sanford - the Orlando suburb where Martin was shot - found Zimmerman and another man had already helped a couple and their two children out of a flipped SUV off the road near Interstate 4. They were not hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman spoke with a deputy at the scene and then left, the sheriff's office statement said. He did not see the crash happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is believed to be the first time Zimmerman, 29, has been seen publicly since his acquittal on a second-degree murder charge in the 17-year-old Martin's death in February 2012. Zimmerman's parents and his attorneys have said in interviews since the verdict that they fear for his safety because of those who may not agree with it. A message left at the office of Zimmerman attorney Mark O'Mara was not immediately returned Monday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - &quot;In the jewelry store, they lock the case when I walk in,&quot; the young African-American man wrote. &quot;In the shoe store, they help the white man who walks in after me. In the shopping mall they follow me. ... Black male: Guilty until proven innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have lost control of my emotions,&quot; he declared. &quot;Rage, Frustration, Anguish, Despondency, Fatigue, Bitterness, Animosity, Exasperation, Sadness. Emotions once suppressed, emotions once channeled, now are let loose. Why?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The words came not in response to the George Zimmerman verdict in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin killing but rather to the acquittal of the police officers in the Rodney King case. The author of the May 6, 1992, column in the Stanford University student newspaper: Cory Booker, now the nationally celebrated mayor of Newark and the front-runner to be the next senator from New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker pointed me toward his angry essay while on a visit to Washington last week. We spoke over a late breakfast the day before President Obama went to the White House briefing room to issue his powerful reminder to Americans that &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It tells us something important about America in 2013 that two exceptionally successful African-American men, both of them widely acclaimed across the lines of race, chose independently to underscore the same truth about the Martin killing: that, in the president's words, &quot;the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And both focused resolutely on how to make things better. My interview with Booker didn't start with the Zimmerman trial. Instead, the practically-minded mayor spoke enthusiastically about a program he had established in cooperation with the libertarian-conservative Manhattan Institute to help men released from prison become better fathers. &quot;The right intervention,&quot; he said, &quot;can create radically different outcomes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker knows about crime. He described his experience of holding a young man who had just been shot, trying and failing to keep him from dying in his arms. He returned home disconsolate and washed off the young man's blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His account, and Obama's later words, put the lie to outrageous claims by right-wing talk jocks and provocateurs that those upset by the outcome in the Zimmerman trial are willfully ignoring the affliction of crime committed by African-Americans against each other. On the contrary: African-American leaders, particularly mayors such as Booker, were struggling to stem violence in their own communities long before it became a convenient topic for those trying to sweep aside the profound problems raised by the Martin case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker fully accepts that there is a right to self-defense. &quot;One of the things I learned from the good cops is that there were some times when they were completely justified in pulling their weapons and killing somebody,&quot; he said. But those good cops, he insisted, also understood that their first obligation was &quot;to defuse a situation,&quot; to try to prevent violence. Zimmerman, Booker added, &quot;having been told by the police to back away, had so many opportunities to defuse the situation.&quot; And, as the president suggested, &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws have exactly the opposite effect: They encourage, rather than discourage, confrontation, particularly on the part of a person with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, Booker wonders, do we have our famous conversations about race only &quot;when things go terribly wrong&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we neared the end of our chat, he offered a thought you are more likely to hear from a preacher than a politician. &quot;Fear is a toxic state of being,&quot; Booker said. &quot;You've got to lead with love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to Booker was a reminder of the bundle of contradictions that is the story of race in America, precisely what Obama was underscoring when he spoke of our progress as well as our difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker - again, like the president - was concerned above all with the practical things government and society can do to battle child poverty and reverse rising inequality. One of the central problems of our time, Booker said, is &quot;the decoupling between wage growth and economic growth,&quot; a development that creates so many other social challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dignity and grace of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's family should inspire us all to keep our eyes on the future. We should not blind ourselves either to the persistence of racism or to our triumphs in pushing it back. That is the message of Booker's old column, and it harmonizes with the candid words from our first black president. We have come a long way and have a long way to go.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">July 23--CARRBORO -- Michelle Johnson was in her kitchen when she heard jurors had found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdict in the fatal shooting of the unarmed black teenager in Florida sparked protests, conversations and a presidential speech about race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her kitchen, Johnson said the verdict was personal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was devastated,&quot; said the Carrboro alderwoman. &quot;I felt like I couldn't breathe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Johnson, who is black, the not guilty verdict triggered memories of times when she and her relatives had been treated unfairly because of the color of their skin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a lot of grief,&quot; she said. &quot;It felt like every trauma I had experienced related to race, and all the traumas that my mother and my grandmother experienced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call it cultural trauma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, a week after the verdict, Johnson organized a gathering at Carrboro Town Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 55 people, mostly white women, attended. The meeting opened with spoken word poetry from the Sacrificial Poets, including C.J. Suitt, who described growing up with the fear of being different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me, it's personal; it's not political,&quot; he said, echoing Johnson. As a black boy, he said he grew up taught to fear his surroundings. &quot;Getting older, I realized my learning had to be based on awareness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group then split, the black people in one room, the whites in another. The black group asked for privacy while they talked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the white group, an exercise asked people what they were feeling and where in their bodies they were feeling it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel anger, a rage, in my head,&quot; someone said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel exhausted everywhere,&quot; another offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pissed off,&quot; said Alderwoman Jacquelyn Gist, one of four elected Carrboro board members present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several people said white people still have privilege in society and that breaking racism and other &quot;-isms&quot; down can start as simply as saying &quot;hello&quot; to people who are different from you, instead of passing them by or avoiding eye contact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a white person I will always have some racism in me, and I think it's important to recognize that,&quot; said Susan Spalt. &quot;I think a lot of us in the '60s thought we'd get past that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 13-year-old Monique McLeod, getting to share her thoughts and hear others' Saturday was exciting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel no matter how much money they have, (people who kill people) should still be sent to jail,&quot; the Smith Middle-schooler said. &quot;You kill somebody, it's wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope everyone in America would actually open their eyes and actually see how America is,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Johnson said she felt a responsibility as a black elected leader to do something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's case is so public,&quot; she said. &quot;But teens of color are getting killed all the time.&quot; And even when they are not physically hurt, children of color suffer in other ways such as the achievement gap that limits their opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The history of black people in this country is rooted in slavery and laws and public policy that have treated dark-skinned people as less, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To those who say slavery ended a long time ago, she said: &quot;It's not that long. I think that (statement) is a way of distancing. When I hear that, I think that's a way of negating that legacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we think in 2013 we're so far removed from that, we're not.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march will be at 9 a.m., starting from the northwest corner of the Home Depot parking lot, at the corner of Third Street and Nelson Avenue, to an area at the Butte County Courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Irma Jordan said in an e-mail that the march is regarding George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of then-17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, Stand Your Ground laws, racial and other profiling and the Supreme Court's removal of Section 4 from the Voters Rights Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan also said the group wants to look into local laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight American presidents owned slaves while living in the White House. President Zachary Taylor pledged that his fellow slave-owners would &quot;appeal to the sword if necessary&quot; to keep them. So when an American president arrived at the White House briefing room to speak of his personal experience with racial bias, it stirred some historical ghosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, President Obama's 18-minute remarks did not aspire to memorable rhetoric. Rather than &quot;I have a dream,&quot; it was &quot;I have an explanation.&quot; But he explained something uncomfortable and important: How America contains within itself different experiences of the promise and justice of America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking as president, Obama responsibly affirmed the integrity of the legal process in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. Speaking as an African-American, he identified with the experience of being singled out for scrutiny. He talked of being followed in department stores and of being preceded by clicking car locks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some conservatives attacked Obama for being &quot;divisive&quot; and for injecting race into the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin debate. Those criticisms were misdirected. It is perfectly appropriate for a president to apply his own history to his role as communicator and policymaker. Was it out of bounds for John F. Kennedy, who had a mentally disabled sister, to call for an overhaul of the nation's mental health system in 1963? Was it inappropriate for Lyndon Johnson, who grew up in Texas without electricity or indoor plumbing, to convene the National Advisory Commission on Rural Poverty? Or is it only concerning the issue of race that a president should ignore his own background for fear of being &quot;divisive&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposite criticism is more serious -- that Obama has missed opportunities over the years to talk about race in a compelling and personal way. It is the unavoidable American issue. At one point, a third of all human beings in the South were owned by another human being. Jim Crow laws enforced a racial caste system. The election of an African-American president is a wonder of national healing and historical compression. Who can argue that we have heard too much from Obama on this topic? For five years, he strategically downplayed the reality of his own miracle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has a unique standing to address the challenges of minority youth. As a young man, he was prone to trouble and might have easily gotten enmeshed in an unforgiving legal system. The president can effectively argue that first impressions are not always correct, and that second chances are sometimes necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's speech deserves this criticism: Its policy proposals -- training police, reconsidering &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, more community dialogue and &quot;soul-searching&quot; -- were weak. It was as though the administration's policy apparatus had never really considered the matter before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But is there really nothing practical that can be done? How about providing family supports -- mentoring, fatherhood initiatives, teen pregnancy prevention, and removing the Earned Income Tax Credit penalty for married couples? How about strong accountability measures to close the educational achievement gap instead of granting waivers that lower standards? How about support for faith-based institutions that reclaim lives from gangs? How about prison reform, so that mandatory minimum sentences are at least reduced? How about expanding substance abuse prevention and treatment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging a vast national division in a responsible way, as Obama has done, is not itself divisive. But healing that division will require the president to employ a presidential power he seldom uses: to drive and shape a policy debate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- An overwhelming majority of US blacks say the verdict of George Zimmerman was wrong, while a majority of whites say the verdict was right, a Gallup poll showed Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll found, an overwhelming 85 percent of blacks say the verdict, which acquits Zimmerman of second degree murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin, was wrong. A majority of whites, 54 percent, on the other hand, say the verdict was right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans overall are divided in their views of the verdict: 43 percent say it was right and 40 percent wrong, according to the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallup noted these results are almost exactly the opposite of blacks' and whites' reactions to the innocent verdict handed down by a Los Angeles jury in the murder trial of O.J. Simpson in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a survey conducted in October of that year, about two weeks after the verdict, 89 percent of blacks said the jury had made the right decision, while by a 53 percent to 36 percent margin, whites said the jury's decision was wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also a racial difference on view of justice system's bias. According to the poll, while 68 percent of blacks say U.S. justice system is biased against blacks, only 25 percent of whites agree. It also found blacks' attitudes about the justice system have remained virtually constant over the past 20 years, but whites have become less likely to perceive bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not guilty verdict in the Zimmerman trial has resulted in an outpour of complaints about racial bias in the way the U.S. criminal justice system works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gallup said these underlying attitudes provide the cognitive framework black Americans and white Americans use to interpret specific instances of the criminal justice system at work, including views of the recent Zimmerman case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new results are based on interviews with 2,541 Americans, including 1,841 non-Hispanic whites and 230 non-Hispanic blacks, conducted during the July 16-21 period, after the verdict in the Zimmerman trial was handed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the shooting death of Martin last year in Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It explores the idea of the nanny state that's gone a bit out of control, and this idea that Australia is fast becoming the biggest nanny state in the world,&quot; Conway said. &quot;We legislate everything for the safety of the people, and the issue with bubble-wrapping everybody in society is that you take away the element of risk and danger.&quot; By insulating its children from the outside world as much as possible, the community in Wickfield Wonderland inadvertently creates its own set of problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a case in the UK in 2009 where the government instituted rules for people on welfare who were not parenting to a level that the government deemed acceptable,&quot; Conway said. &quot;So they had CCTV cameras installed in their homes, and people within the government department could basically turn on at anytime of the day to ensure that kids were being appropriately cared for, fed, going to bed at a particular time, doing their homework, and their welfare payments were dependent on their passing these particular rules.&quot; While supposedly contributing to society's wellbeing, safety measures such as surveillance and fencing could simply fuel paranoia - and potentially bring about tragic consequences, as in the case of Trayvon Martin's fatal shooting in a Florida gated community last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It creates an immediate us and them,&quot; Conway said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE 'REAL HOUSEWIVES of New York&quot; have gone primal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;RHONY&quot; castmates Heather Thomson, LuAnn de Lesseps, Ramona Singer and Kristen Taekman are coming off a week of feeding on red meat and stockpiling camping gear for an upcoming trip to the mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suddenly grizzly quartet (from l., Thomson, Singer and de Lesseps; below, Taekman) was recently spied devouring steak at the Meatpacking District's Old Homestead Steakhouse, where they were joined by four male pals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No tofu, no alfalfa sprouts, no grilled veggies on this check,&quot; joked one witness to the carnage. &quot;Just a lot of red meat and testosterone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staffers were seen presenting the lipstick-wearing carnivores with two slabs of 2&nbsp;&frac12;-inch-thick, 44-ounce Gotham rib steaks that one spy compared to &quot;something out of the 'Flintstones.&quot; That bounty of bovine was followed by Texas T-bone and sirloin steaks, and mounds of creamed spinach, truffle mac and cheese, and garlic mashed potatoes. De Lesseps' French boyfriend, Jacques Azoulay, selected matching wines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before that, the table was covered with straight-from-the-net appetizers, including giant seafood towers stacked with chilled jumbo shrimp, lobster, oysters, clams and crabmeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources tell us the ladies had worked up an appetite early that day with a three-hour shopping spree at SoHo's Eastern Mountain Sports, where they stocked up on supplies for the upcoming camping trip to the Berkshires, where Thomson has a home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shopping spree was hilarious, watching these hot babes in their heels, makeup and body-hugging dresses shopping for - of all things - camping gear,&quot; says one &quot;Housewives&quot; insider. &quot;Roughing it in the woods just doesn't seem like their thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may not be. While mapping out their plan at the steakhouse, a couple of &quot;RHONY&quot; castmates were heard saying that if the going got tough, they were going to Thomson's house for running water, air conditioning and the sort of things they've come to expect. But according to our snitch, getting that plan by Thomson may be tricky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thomson has the whole weekend planned,&quot; says our spy. &quot;She's going to be like a camp drill sergeant. She's taking them on a hike in the morning, fishing in the afternoon. This doesn't sound like a trip for makeup - or the squeamish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's possible the Housewives developed a taste for blood during talks leading up to season six, which began filming slightly behind schedule in mid-May after tense contract disputes between Bravo network executives and the stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEYONC&Eacute; ON TOP OF THE NEWS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyonc&eacute; has excellent taste in New York City newspapers. After The News put a photo of Bey, her husband, Jay Z, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Trayvon&nbsp;Martin's mother at a &quot;Justice for Trayvon&quot; march in New York on the Sunday cover, Mrs. Carter (l.) posted a photo of The News' cover on Instagram. Nice to know the queen of hip hop starts her day with cereal, Fiji water and New York's Hometown Newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAT HASN'T QUITE KLUM OFF YET</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This seal is definitely endangered. After spending a few topless days and nights with her children and new boyfriend Martin Kirsten in Bora Bora, Heidi Klum was spotted at LAX revealing the remnants of the &quot;Seal&quot; tattoo (above) she used to have on her right forearm. Klum, who turned 40 in June, was married to singer Seal for seven years until their split last year. Although the ink appears to have been removed, that tat is clearly skin-deep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MORGAN: YOU GOTTA BELIEVE (IN YOURSELF )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;30 Rock&quot; star Tracy Morgan (r.) told Daily News editor Zach Haberman about the importance of believing in yourself after performing at the Stand comedy club in Gramercy Sunday night. &quot;It's all about confidence,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Look at me. I don't even have a GED, and I make $10 million a year.&quot; He then translated his philosophy to the bedroom. &quot;Confidence. If you're making love to a woman and your arms are shaking, she's not having a good time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NFL PICKS UP A KEY BLOCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since shoulder pads and helmets aren't flattering on most women, NFL Women's Apparel has hired Phillip Bloch (above) as official creative fashion director. Bloch will help launch the league's fall women's wear line in September, which is when Fashion Week gets underway and football season kicks off, too. No doubt New Yorkers will have gridiron on the brain this fall, as we wait for Super Bowl XLVIII on our home turf in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SELENA'S PARTYING LIKE IT'S 21</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selena Gomez turned 21 on Monday, but started celebrating Saturday night with pal Lily Collins at Julianne Hough's 25th birthday party at L.A.'s Cicada Club. Our insider says Gomez (above) and Collins left Nina Dobrev, Ashley Greene and Chord Overstreet partying at that 1920s-themed bash and headed to Beacher's Madhouse Theater, where they danced up an appetite, then ate a leopard-decorated birthday cake. The party girls left together around 2 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOU CAN BUY INTO SPIKE'S NEW SCENE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spike Lee wants you to do the right thing - and give him money! The director (above) has launched an obnoxious online campaign on Kickstarter asking civilians to help fund his next film. Lee is asking donors for $1.25 million over the next month, but offered few details about the project. The lucky rich person who donates $10,000 will get a trip with Lee to watch his beloved Knicks play from the director's pricey courtside seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S BETTER IN BAHAMAS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will filming for Judd Apatow's &quot;The Other Woman&quot; ever end? Or will we just be staring at photos of Sports Illustrated beauty Kate Upton's (above r.) enviable cleavage the rest of our lives? Apatow's leading ladies - Upton, Cameron Diaz (r.) and Apatow's wife, Leslie Mann - laughed and wore hats in the crystalline waters of the Bahamas on a rare day off from shooting, which has already taken place in New York City and the Hamptons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLUNT &amp; CRUISE GO COMIC-AL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; co-stars Emily Blunt, 30, -and Tom Cruise, 51, palled around at Comic-Con in San Diego last weekend to promote their upcoming sci-fi flick, directed by Doug Liman. Blunt wore a pretty pink and purple Wes Gordon dress, and Cruise reminded everyone what a charmer he can be when the Church of Scientology isn't around. We hope the oft-grumpy Suri is taking notes!</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE neighbourhood watch volunteer who has been in hiding since his acquittal for shooting dead an unarmed black teenager helped to rescue a family from a car crash, police disclosed yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Zimmerman's whereabouts have remained secret after the verdict provoked nationwide protests, a debate about race and guns and intervention by President Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the report from the local sheriff's office indicates that he has not left his central Florida home town of Sanford where he killed 17-year-old Trayvon&nbsp;Martin after a confrontation in his gated community in February last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Zimmerman, 29, was one of two men who went to the rescue of two parents and their two children after their sport utility vehicle overturned at a highway junction in Sanford last Wednesday. He helped the family out of the crashed car and waited for the police to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zimmerman was not a witness to the crash and left after making contact with the deputy,&quot; said Heather Smith, the police spokesman. &quot;There were no report of injuries to the vehicle occupants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sheriff's department has not released any details about the family, or the other man with Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There had been speculation that he would leave the area to start a new life after a jury accepted his lawyer's argument that he had shot Trayvon in self-defence because he feared for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate development, Sanford police said they had handed evidence from their investigation to the FBI as the Department of Justice investigates whether to press federal hate crime charges against Mr Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ided by Florida's flawed self-defense laws, George Zimmerman won acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, an unarmed teenager who was minding his own business walking to his father's home in Sanford. The verdict underscores the urgent need for the criminal justice system to find a better way to deal with Floridians increasingly prone to use deadly force and claim justifiable homicide.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts seem to agree that the law and the judge's instructions left the jury little choice. But the overwhelming feeling of unfairness over the verdict voiced by so many Floridians and others across the nation -- of all political affiliations, races and ethnicities -- cannot be ignored.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Absent redress, the anger and frustration will turn into contempt for the law.<BR><BR><BR><BR> The acquittal fails to satisfy a basic sense of justice. The fact that the victim was black and the shooter was not compounds the tragedy and deepens the bitter frustration felt by black people in our community, where Trayvon&nbsp;Martin lived, and elsewhere. How, they ask, can this be fair?<BR><BR><BR><BR> Now it's up to the U.S. Justice Department to determine whether federal charges should be filed under hate-crime or civil-rights statutes. An investigation is certainly warranted, but many legal analysts believe that chances of a successful prosecution are slim. Zimmerman is a civilian -- not acting as an agent of the law -- with no history of overt racism.<BR><BR><BR><BR> That brings the issue back to Florida's self-defense statutes. It is one of at least 20 states with provisions that don't require civilians to flee from an intruder before fighting back. One study found that in states with these &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws, the rates of murder and non-negligent manslaughter increased by 8 percent, an additional 600 homicides per year.<BR><BR><BR><BR> It also found that whites who kill blacks in Stand Your Ground states are far more likely to be found justified in their killings.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Zimmerman did not explicitly invoke that doctrine, but the law's impact in homicide cases has made Florida more dangerous, a state that gives free rein to confrontations resulting in homicide.<BR><BR><BR><BR> The judge's charge to the Zimmerman jury said that he had the right &quot;to meet force with force, including deadly force&quot; if he believed he was in danger of death or great bodily harm.<BR><BR><BR><BR> Before Stand Your Ground, however, the jury's charge would have been far different: &quot;The fact that the defendant was wrongfully attacked cannot justify his use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm if by retreating he could have avoided the need to use that force.&quot;<BR><BR><BR><BR> To this day, Florida lawmakers have shown no desire to change back to that sensible standard of 2005. Conversely, the impact of the new law demonstrates an urgent need to roll back the new doctrine.<BR><BR><BR><BR> An analysis of the law by the Tampa Bay Times earlier this year contained disturbing findings. Nearly 70 percent of those who invoke Stand Your Ground to avoid prosecution have gone free. Further, defendants claiming Stand Your Ground are more likely to prevail if the victim is black. Seventy-three percent of those who killed a black person faced no penalty compared to 59 percent of those who killed a white.<BR><BR><BR><BR> The Legislature, in thrall to the NRA, is unlikely to change the self-defense law. But with Stand Your Ground being invoked more often and &quot;justifiable&quot; killings on the rise, lawmakers have to ask themselves what kind of state they want: One where justice prevails, or one where the law acts as an enabler of homicidal violence?<BR><BR><BR><BR> -- The Miami Herald  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GEORGE Zimmerman's non - guilty verdict was expected right from the time a six-member single gender white majority jury was selected to decide the fate of Zimmerman in the murder case of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American teenager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was quite abnormal to select a six-member jury consisting of white majority women to decide such a high-profile case which caught the attention of thousands of people around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from this, it was dubious the prosecutor lawyers did not object to this single gender jury in spite of underplaying the racial tone prevalent in the case and suspected racial profiling of the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not arresting the defendant for 44 days after the incident, as well as sparing him from not taking the stand when he is the only person alive and involved in scuffle and killing the victim, supports the allegation of racial undertone of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people are right in losing faith in the American judicial system as it does not deliver the requisite justice when it comes to dealing with people of an African-American background. In Town Hall meetings, people have pointed out that the people of African- American background are generally punished 25 per cent more than their white counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the outcome of Rodney King and Zimmerman cases, one may suspect that a non-racial society is not in existence in the USA and the situation needs to be resolved for public satisfaction by re-opening the case under fundamental civil rights of life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bill pending in a legislative committee would make Ohio the latest state with a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law of the type that has caused controversy in the Florida trial of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted in the death of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buried in House Bill 203, the latest effort to loosen restrictions on the carrying of concealed handguns, is a provision that would broaden Ohio law that currently presumes someone acted in self-defense if he feels he or his family members are in imminent danger and shoots an intruder in his home or car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a mistake to require a person to turn their back on their assailant to try and flee,&quot; the bill's sponsor, Rep. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, told lawmakers in June during the sole hearing so far on the bill. The Republican-controlled General Assembly has since recessed for the summer and won't take up the measure until September at the earliest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I was out with my family, and we were attacked, I would want to be able to defend them and exercise my constitutional right to do so,&quot; said Johnson, a Cincinnati-area physician. &quot;The person will still have to show in a court of law that they were acting in self-defense, and we are making no changes to the threshold a person has to meet to demonstrate self-defense in a court of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation would expand the circumstances under which lawful Ohio gun owners have no legal duty to retreat when assaulted before using potentially deadly force to defend themselves in any &quot;place that the person lawfully has a right to be&quot; - in other words, just about anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Fulkerson, deputy chief counsel for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, offered as examples of exceptions burglars or intruders on private property as well as people prohibited from being in certain places by court-issued protection orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hesitated to say expanding the &quot;no duty to retreat&quot; provision would give Ohio a &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hesitate to get caught up in the label,&quot; he said, emphasizing that the Attorney General's Office has not taken a position on House Bill 203. &quot;There is no uniform 'stand your ground' law. It's not a legal label; it's more of a popular culture label.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Florida, attorneys for Zimmerman did not invoke the state's 2005 &quot;stand your ground&quot; law as his defense but tried the case as an instance of self-defense. Still, the law has garnered significant attention, particularly after the not guilty verdicts were returned a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman said he shot the 17-year-old in self-defense when Martin attacked him in February 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When first introduced, Ohio's Castle Doctrine bill went well beyond the home and vehicle, but lawmakers scaled it back before sending it on to then-Gov. Ted Strickland, who signed it into law in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got it taken out then, and now they're returning to try again,&quot; said Toby Hoover, executive director of the Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence. &quot;Ironically, the rest of the country is moving in the other direction after seeing what's possible with this ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have the right to defend yourself and always will,&quot; she said. &quot;All we're saying is that, legally and morally, you have an obligation to try to retreat before taking a human life. That's the first choice - life has to come first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fulkerson said the definition of &quot;duty to retreat&quot; is a key difference between Ohio's and Florida's laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Generally speaking, 'stand your ground' laws' legal hook, if you will, is that you do not have a duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, and what Castle Doctrine laws in Ohio is you don't have those duties in your home and your vehicle,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very generally speaking, the logic behind that is if you're in your home, where do you retreat to? If you're in your vehicle, how do you get away?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jelani Jefferson Exum, associate professor of law at the University of Toledo, said that while different states have varying laws regarding the use of deadly force, all recognize that people have the right to defend themselves if they feel they are in grave danger and cannot get away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can all use deadly force even on a public street if we believed deadly force was being used against us and we couldn't run away,&quot; she said. &quot; 'Stand your ground' says you never even have to think about, 'Can I get away before I kill this person?' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By her count, 24 states have &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws. Michigan approved its law in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's becoming an increasing trend for people to say, 'I never have to think about running away before I use deadly force,' &quot; Ms. Jefferson Exum said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Lingo, chief of the criminal division for the Lucas County Prosecutor's Office, said the office routinely presents all self-defense shootings to a grand jury, allowing in effect the public to determine whether a person was within the law to use deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's only fair that in a case where someone has used that doctrine to protect themselves that a jury of their peers review it to make sure it was a correct application of the law,&quot; Mr. Lingo said. &quot;Out of fairness, it's the right thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It only takes a moment to become pregnant so 20 weeks to terminate a life seems random. While both sides of the debate are emotionally charged, the right to life seems to be taking a back seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One group's argument rests on the idea that the price of this measure would cost $36 million to keep our licensed clinics open. If that group were to pass the hat among its members or refocus its efforts to have the state absorb the cost of clinics needing upgrades, the supposed objective of &quot;protecting women&quot; would be less of a ruse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unborn children and women's rights are the collateral victims of our debate on the Texas Abortion Bill, but funding is once again the silver bullet. We've got politicians going on bus tours and building their cases and careers on our problems when they should be addressing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only five of the 47 abortion clinics in Texas meets the qualifications and are acceptable under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El Paso's only clinics not meeting the standards is worth addressing, and something we should be concerned about. The focus needs to be funding upgrades to clinics deemed unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A problem has been brought to light, but what's on the next slide? Random rants from long-winded politicians and boisterous women toting symbolic wire hangers are irrelevant to a woman's response to an unplanned pregnancy. That life-altering response should not be aggravated by unsafe medical options.</SPAN></P>

For stealing the very same citizenry of their right to vote for whomever or whatever and whichever way they choose, not what Cook and his cronies wanted, because and they, including &quot;JW&quot; herself, thought they were crazies and too stupid to understand what they were voting for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He blames the city attorney's office for providing bad advice. If they believed that Cook, et al., were right, they should've provided his legal service, since they represent the City of El Paso in the legal arena and since he was an elected official of the City of El Paso, thinking he was representing the City of El Paso, perhaps correcting their &quot;unclear text or grammar.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 9/11, federal funding has delivered millions, if not billions, of dollars to this community. I feel ashamed that our elected leaders have neglected to anticipate the obvious needs of EMS, fire, and police agencies by a lack of a technical management for the county and city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We enjoy the safest big-city designation due to the tremendous number of federal, state, county and city agencies in place at taxpayer expense. Coordination and sharing of these assets by all entities would be beneficial to taxpayers, allow for programmed management of electronic resources, and save money by eliminating duplication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is the time for elected officials to concentrate on management, not crisis management. We have elected, through representation, to make our community look and feel good with inadequate focus on the operations and maintenance funding to sustain requirements today and in the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">409 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It matters what things are called. Mere words can set standards and expectations for what happens after an idea or an enterprise is launched. If, that is, people pay attention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus it should be stressed from time to time that the programs, official and not, that involve everyday people stepping up to help prevent crime in their homes and streets are called neighborhood watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watch. Not pursue. Not confront. Not take the law, and a deadly weapon, into one's own hands and do, probably wrongly, something that even trained police officers might have trouble doing perfectly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this comes to mind after the verdict in the Florida trial of George Zimmerman, the man who was accused -- and, eventually, acquitted -- of murder after he shot and killed an unarmed teenager named Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the controversy, Zimmerman was described as a neighborhood watch volunteer. If so, he was a horribly overzealous one, whose unwise actions have seriously and unfairly besmirched the reputation of neighborhood watch volunteers all across the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole idea of a neighborhood watch program is for people to take common sense measures to make themselves and their neighbors less vulnerable to crime. In addition to being additional eyes and ears -- not additional guns -- for the police, they also encourage households to do such things as lock doors and windows, install motion-sensing lighting and keep shrubs from growing large enough to provide burglars or other crooks with convenient hiding places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As reported in Sunday's Tribune, such efforts have been shown to make a mark in reducing crime in some Salt Lake City neighborhoods, the East Liberty Park neighborhood prime among them. With no collateral damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This despite Utah's highly permissive gun laws, including the same stand-your-ground law that was blamed for establishing a showdown atmosphere in the Zimmerman case, even though it was not officially a point in the trial and verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is that intelligent neighborhood watch programs and the stand-your-ground mentality are clearly at cross-purposes with one another. The former seeks to avoid confrontation, the latter frankly encourages it. So far, the Utah version of stand-your-ground has no body count attached to it. Perhaps that is because Utahns, despite all the tough talk, know better than to behave as though armed confrontations lead to peaceful streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps we've just been lucky.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The office of State Attorney Angela Corey faces potential sanctions and will have to pay thousands of dollars in taxpayer money after failing to turn over all documents in a wrongful termination case filed by a former employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It prompted a scolding by U.S. District Judge Timothy Corrigan and follows similar criticisms in the failed prosecution of George Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julie Lyncker, a former clerk in the Nassau County office, says she was fired after she complained about the way former Assistant State Attorney Wesley White treated her. Lyncker says her civil rights were violated and the firing was an illegal retaliation for reporting wrongdoing in the office. She is asking for undisclosed damages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, Corrigan agreed to delay the case after lawyers representing the State Attorney's Office admitted they didn't provide opposing attorneys key evidence until Saturday. A jury was scheduled to be picked Monday and the two sides were supposed to turn over all materials months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge sent 40 potential jurors home and told Corey's attorneys that the office would have to recompense the court for the $2,500 it cost to bring the jurors in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This stuff hits the case where it lives,&quot; Corrigan said. &quot;And it's hard to understand how this happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corey also was accused of withholding key findings from Trayvon Martin's cellphone in the Zimmerman trial and faces potential sanctions there. Zimmerman was acquitted after claiming self-defense in Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonard Hackett, a private attorney hired to defend the State Attorney's Office, confirmed he discovered emails discussing the firing of Lyncker between senior staff on Saturday while prepping a witness who was going to testify in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He immediately turned them over to Joseph DeBelder, Lyncker's lead attorney. But DeBelder said he needed to depose Corey, former Chief Assistant State Attorney Dan McCarthy and several other employees again because of what the emails said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous depositions Corey and McCarthy both said McCarthy decided to fire Lyncker, and Corey wasn't involved. But one of the emails turned over Saturday had McCarthy telling White that he gave the &quot;Boss&quot; an option to retain Lyncker and a second option that would fire her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boss&quot; could only be Corey, and the emails suggest that Corey made the final decision, DeBelder said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White and McCarthy, who have both left the State Attorney's Office, declined to comment Monday. After the hearing, Hackett told the Times-Union that McCarthy made the final decision to fire Lyncker but declined to discuss the newly discovered emails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hackett said he couldn't guarantee there weren't other missing emails and Corrigan said that left him no choice but to delay the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing about these emails is they are directly on point,&quot; Corrigan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeBelder said he wants to question Corey and McCarthy a second time under oath and also wants to depose former information technology director Ben Kruidbos, who was fired by Corey after he testified last month about being concerned prosecutors did not turn over information to Zimmerman's defense team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeBelder said it appears the emails in question were collected and printed out by Kruidbos. White, who is planning to represent Kruidbos in a wrongful termination lawsuit against Corey, said his client would have no comment on his role in the Lyncker case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Lyncker also want to be allowed to conduct a forensic review of the state attorney's email system to determine if there is more correspondence they should have. Whether that is allowed will be discussed at a future hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corrigan said the State Attorney's Office will have to pay the cost of all future depositions in the case because it was responsible for the delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her lawsuit, Lyncker said White, who was then the top Nassau prosecutor, repeatedly asked Lyncker if she was having sex with former Nassau Sheriff Tommy Seagraves and tried to use Lyncker as a go between to improve his relationship with the sheriff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lyncker, who denies having an affair with Seagraves, said she refused to help White and complained about the way he was treating her to Corey and McCarthy, but they fired her after she complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Corey said Lyncker's complaints were looked into, but when they questioned other Nassau employees, they found out that Lyncker engaged in inappropriate behavior and was fired because of what was discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That inappropriate behavior includes talking about sexual acts and people she'd like to have sex with in the office, slapping male colleagues on the butt and wearing inappropriate clothing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Vice President Joe Biden is in India on a four-day 'goodwill' visit. One of the leading dailies in Mumbai has already interviewed him with predicable questions (China, Taliban, Pakistan and Drone attacks, immigration, Obama-Biden legacy) and published predictable answers. Another important foreign dignitary was allowed to get away with the art-of-saying nothing. The FPJ framed a list of different questions which we hope would catch the attention of the Vice President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Mr Vice President, while the US President and the Vice President use Air Force 1 for their foreign visits, one of the planes goes along carrying the most sophisticated snooping equipment to tap telephones, listen into private conversations and so on. Can you mention the special equipment you have carried with you on this 'goodwill' visit? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Which is more interesting, eavesdropping on the allies or the not-so-friendly nations? Can you explain your government's strategy on getting out of this snooping mess when you get caught?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: The world was surprised to hear your government would negotiate with the 'good' Taliban. Can you tell us how the US distinguishes 'good' Taliban from the 'Bad' one? What is the US Treasury allocation for the development of special Drones which would bomb and kill only Bad Taliban?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: The US, asked or not, dispensed justice to the entire world. For instance, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and so on? Who, in the Obama administration, would dispense justice for the 19-year-old black youth Trayvon&nbsp;Martin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What percentage of his poll promises, do you think, would Barack Obama fulfill? Do you agree that normally US Presidents lose interest in governing during heir second terms? And if one of them had already won the Nobel Peace Prize even before he could count the number of rooms in the White House, why should he labour once more for peace progress?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Are you ready to talk with our Opposition party, BJP, to consider its request to send 29-year old George Zimmerman, the killer of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, to train Gujarat police on the art of encounter killings and getting away with them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: According to your promise, you would be exiting from Afghanistan by end 2014 with (as the world says) you tail between your legs? Any plans for exhibiting this tail at the Washington Smithsonian? Would this exit be as inglorious as the one from Vietnam? The one factor missing was a Henry Kissinger!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: In the past whenever it had suited you, you provided us with food grains and arms. The major complaint among Indians now is that we lack governance. Are you ready to supply some of this to us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Would the US state department set up Human Rights Schools to teach us, how, when and where to raise this issue? This was so confusing, Sri Lanka, protecting its national integrity was guilty of human rights violations, but not Israel which did this every day with US weaponry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Everywhere you go, you will hear people and media referring to Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh as a 'lame duck'. What will be your strategy in dealing with lame duck leaders? Dr Singh is likely to visit Washington next September? Will he be feted or sort of brushed aside as a lame duck?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: The BJP charges Rs five for anyone who wants to meet Narendra Modi? Are you ready with the note if you happened to meet Modi?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Will you be interacting with Bollywoood during your halt in Mumbai and will your secret service halt actor Shah Rukh Khan for hours and subject him to a body search?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Retiring Presidents in US seldom had anything worthwhile to do? How was it with Vice Presidents?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: We heard rumours that the President would revive the Peace Corps programme and send his two daughters as volunteers to India because he and the First Lady wanted to be left alone for some well-earned rest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you Mr Vice President!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the best new books out there - &quot;something close to a non-fiction masterpiece,&quot; according to a New York Times reviewer - is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Unwinding</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by George Packer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It tells the story of the descent of inner America, the collapse of structures as a result of deregulation, the rampant insecurities with the decline of permanent jobs, debates overtaken by extremes of opinion. Mr. Packer's theory is that the United States has been Wal-Martized. Lower wages, lower prices, lower standards. It's been good for the company, and as he says: &quot;Eventually six of the surviving Waltons would have as much money as the bottom 30 per cent of the country.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the decline of the big economic middle is ominous, as is the seizure of the national discussion by polemicists. How can a country move forward without a rallying consensus? Not even Barack Obama, with his balanced mind, his instinct for compromise and his eloquence (as most recently manifested on the topic of the Trayvon Martin verdict) can stop the fraying.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book's author is not an American declinist. There have been other unravellings; rebuilds inevitably follow. But the context is different now. America's greatest century is behind it. Its degree of dominance will likely never be the same. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to all this, how does Canada, the big neighbour to the north, position itself? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America's plight wasn't anticipated. Following the signing of the free-trade agreement in the late 1980s, the expectation was that the integration of the two economies would continue apace. There was talk of a common currency, a customs union and a gradual easing away of the border, as in Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Liberal governments of Jean Chr&eacute;tien and Paul Martin hit the pause button. But with the coming to power of the new breed of Conservatives, a brand tied in some respects to Republican Party values, the integration impulse was expected to return. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It hasn't. Instead we've seen an attempt to ease dependence on the United States by a policy, yet realized, of market diversification. There's been a measured distance in relations. At the same time, Stephen Harper's Conservatives have sought a refurbishing of our British identity through a hoisting of grand Britannia symbols, glorification of the War of 1812 and renewed reverence for the monarchy. It harks back to the conservatism of John Diefenbaker, whose sympathies were with the old Empire and who feared U.S. domination. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today's resetting of the scales - a new trilateralism, if you will - has its merits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canadians are divided in their view of the monarchy. I'm not an enthusiast. As was well argued on these pages Monday by Ratna Omidvar, swearing allegiance to the Queen is an outmoded pastime. But the British heritage is an integral part of our definition, our identity. A stronger etching of it in the public consciousness and a greater reach to other markets is not unhealthy at a time when American paramountcy is fading, when our dependency on the United States is diminishing, when a distance in the bilateral relationship is growing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It may be the beginning of a big turn. There are still major stakes in play, such as the Keystone XL pipeline, but Canadian trade volumes with the United States are in decline after a century of continual growth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That slide is expected to continue as Asian powers and others take up greater market share. U.S. reliance on Canadian energy resources is on the wane; some project a dramatic falloff. Although 9/11 has dragged Canada more deeply into the U.S. intelligence-gathering network, we no longer rely on U.S. defence protections, as we did in the Cold War days. Culturally, the workings of time have brought us a stronger, more distinct stamp. As for our border, it has thickened rather than easing away. We now need passports to cross it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Americans undergo their unwinding, so do we. In recognition of new realities, we unwind from them. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is another reason why I have absolutely no interest in living in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike my parents, who used to spend their retirement winters as snowbirds in Florida and think everything is better in the U.S., I really have no yearning for it other than a quick in and out. Typical, nice place to visit; wouldn't want to live there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of unarmed Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, who was shot after a fight broke out between the two. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, an overzealous neighbourhood watch person who was suspicious of Martin, was told by EMS to wait for police. Instead, he confronted Martin and a fight ensued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman was losing and apparently feared for his life. So he pulled out his gun and shot Martin in the chest. A 17-year-old has lost his life, a security guard now fears for his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not about this case as much as it is about the legal rule that revolves around it - Florida's &quot;stand your ground law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason officials asked for calm before the verdict was read was not necessarily because one side may be angry with the outcome. It was largely due to the fact that most legal minds knew under this law, a not-guilty verdict, was correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those minds belongs to Sherri DeWitt, of DeWitt Law in Florida, who said on CHML the jurors applied the state law: &quot;Stand your ground, and under that law George Zimmerman was protecting himself.&quot; Most in this country have a hard time understanding that; many in the U.S. do too. Which makes one ask, then how did it pass?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orlando attorney said, in layman's terms, under the law: &quot;If you fear death or great bodily harm, or if someone is committing a felony against you, you have the right to protect yourself. Period. You don't have to retreat. You don't have to use other alternatives. As long as you feel in danger of bodily harm, you can shoot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds some may believe Zimmerman brought a gun to a fist fight and that may be true. But if he reasonably believed he was going to endure great bodily harm or death under the &quot;stand you ground law,&quot; he had the absolute right to use a gun to defend himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is much different than using proportional force, emphasizing it does not have to be reasonable force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many citizens think the system didn't work and the Floridian hopes it opens dialogue to better improve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Discussion is needed about how minorities are treated within the justice system. Dialogue is needed about cultural differences in society and how that may affect how people react during a stressful situation,&quot; DeWitt says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says in Florida, young black men don't dial 911 if they need help. They don't trust the system. It's a given. &quot;The discussion has to happen, why is that in our culture?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She concludes, &quot;It's a real, real tragedy. Because Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was scared, his response was to sucker punch George Zimmerman to protect himself in some way, and, unfortunately, it led to his death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is this about Wild West laws or deeply rooted racial tension? I say a toxic combination of both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, we often complain our laws favour the criminal over the victim and refer to the U.S. when talking reform. In Canada, at least Zimmerman would be in jail for this crime, albeit he would be out on day passes in no time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An email to my show reveals the complexity of the debate. Wasn't Trayvon&nbsp;Martin standing his ground when he apparently attacked Zimmerman? Didn't Martin feel threatened? Wasn't Martin defending himself if the facts are true?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wonder if Martin had been carrying a gun and shot Zimmerman, would he have gotten away with murder?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no surprise that a majority of North Carolinians are now opposed to fracking. The law designed to fast-track the controversial process is titled the Domestic Energy Jobs Bill but increasingly the surplus of natural gas created by the &quot;energy boom&quot; is being shipped overseas to the highest bidder. As for the jobs, according to a report by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, there are considerably fewer than was earlier predicted </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this isn't enough to have citizens asking, &quot;What's in it for us,&quot; there is the way in which supporters of fracking have sponsored a series of bills designed to suppress debate, public input and transparency, most recently legislation that prohibits regulation requiring disclosure of chemicals used in fracking fluid. North Carolinians have made clear in polls that they want full disclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever those chemicals are, there's plenty of them - hundreds of thousands of pounds per well. In states where there is disclosure it has been shown that the additives include such dangerous substances as diesel and benzene. The vast amounts of waste water created contain radioactive elements like radium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is fashionable in some quarters to loftily dismiss concerns about groundwater contamination. But one doesn't have to be a NIMBY, alarmist or Luddite to object to drinking, bathing in, cooking with or irrigating with water containing toxins and carcinogens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clarks' conclusion, &quot;So far, he's (Gov. Pat McCrory) disappointing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. In fact, Gov. McCrory is not only not disappointing, he is fulfilling my every expectation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Regarding &quot;Councilman's video link is cut&quot; (Page A-1, July 19):  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What's next? What else is slipping under Paterson's political radar  screen?   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Reading this front-page account of reasons given by Paterson  Councilman Julio Tavarez for his many absences at official meetings  of the Paterson City Council, I have to say I was struck by the  sheer brazenness exhibited by the councilman. He chalks up his  absences as being due to the fact that he was needed in Ohio, where  he is serving an internship while studying for a master's degree in  business administration.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Most positively amazing was Tavarez's attempted use at a recent  meeting of teleconferencing instead of actually being present in  his seat to vote and add to discussion on issues before the  council. That attempt resulted in an uproar and a stop was put to  it. Yet with all his &quot;invisible man&quot; practice, Tavarez was able to  fly in at a previous meeting to cast a vote for council president,  and was promptly rewarded with the chairmanship of the community  development and public works committees.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    The fact that Tavarez is being well-paid for these missed meetings  seems cause for a review, and in my mind falls under the category  of dereliction of duty by an elected public official. The question  that needs an answer is, who is representing Tavarez's 5th Ward  while he is away?  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misconceptions about Zimmerman case  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    I have read several articles about the George Zimmerman case in the  Herald News Opinion section and have also been watching the talk  shows and have seen several people protesting the not-guilty  verdict. I've heard so many inaccurate statements and varying  opinions and after watching the trial from beginning to end, I want  to offer my perspective.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman did not follow Trayvon Martin and did not profile him  because of his race. He observed him from his car and thought he  was acting suspiciously because he was walking very slowly through  this gated community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    I've heard people say that Martin was just walking home. In my  opinion he was not just walking home.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    Zimmerman told the dispatcher that he lost sight of Martin and was  asked if he knew his location. Zimmerman, from what I can tell, at  some point exited the car but I don't believe Martin was racially  profiled.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It seems clear to me that Zimmerman did not follow him and did not  confront Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    It seems ridiculous to hear these protesters misquoting the  testimony from the trial saying Zimmerman got away with murder.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    In my opinion, the way that Jesse Jackson, Eric Holder, President  Obama, Al Sharpton, the NAACP and many other protesters are acting  is disgraceful.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    This country has ruined the life of George Zimmerman, and the  Martin family has lost a son.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">    If everyone knew the facts in this case they might speak and act  differently. In my view it was a case of self-defense.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend, the sweltering dustbowl of Victoria Park in east London played host to a crowd of beery, sweaty twenty-somethings in neon glasses forgetting the working week - soundtracked by house, hip-hop, and a touch of politics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the cool of the half-empty big top John Talabot eases us in. The Spanish DJ channels a fitting Mike Skinner summertime look of buttoned-up polo, khaki shorts and baseball cap. Pop melodies, choral vocals and anthemic samples knocked out on his drum machine show that the laidback charm of his debut album fIN works in a festival setting. His track &quot;Destiny&quot;, with its atmospheric howls, makes for the first dance of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the main stage, Charlie Wilson is accompanied by a brassband in primary-coloured suits, like Madness on acid. The perennial David Rodigan does his crowd-pleasing best with a set of sunshine music. Finishing up with a Bob Marley duo of &quot;Is This Love&quot; and &quot;One Love&quot;, just as the evening breeze picks up, is a winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiley lifts energy levels with opener &quot;Wearing My Rolex&quot; to which the crowd, of course, knows every word. Hackneyites Rudimental give a triumphant home-turf set. A cover of &quot;Ready or Not&quot; by the Fugees embellished with their trademark drum'n'bass skitter and trumpet bursts sounds good against the sunset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a hip-hop-heavy line-up, it's notable that Jurassic 5 and DJ Yoda are the only ones to scratch. J5 provide goosebump-inducing politics, asking the crowd to put a fist in the air for Trayvon Martin. Azealia Banks dedicates her set to him that evening, as does D'Angelo a new track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a decade away, the Brown Sugar singer is funky, soulful, sexual and shows he still has it. Jamie Jones tops his Hot Creations-curated line-up channelling Miami beach party with white lights, palm trees and his genre-defining take on house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For anyone expecting the bashful, self-deprecating panel show-presenting Mark Ronson, the gum-chewing party boy and his two MCs may shock. Playing A$AP into Kendrick into Kanye into Jay-Z, he confirms his record box is still put together with the crowd in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Saturday night is all about East End boy Plan B who fills the stage with a full live band, vivid lighting and plenty of hype men. Asking the crowd to play their air violins, he gives a rowdy performance of &quot;Ill Manors&quot;, accompanied by flares, flames, and scratch guitar.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't mourn for Detroit, says Matthew Yglesias. While decades of economic and population decline were circumstances that brought about Detroit's decline, the bankruptcy itself is a step forward, according to him. Why do more local governments with fiscal problems not file for bankruptcy, asks Yglesias, adding that  America's laws have given easy access to corporations for reorganisation, and bankruptcy is seen as a valid strategic move. Consider American Airlines that declared bankruptcy in 2011 and has emerged a profitable company. &quot;The municipal bankruptcy process is much more difficult,&quot; writes Yglesias. &quot;Even cities in financial distress rarely file for bankruptcy, and when they do, their petitions are often rejected.&quot; Problems arise when politicians and mayors operate with short-term horizons, he says. Subsidised stadiums and convention centres may be good photo-ops but bad economic planning. If it were easier for cities to go bankrupt, cities would be better governed, says Yglesias.</SPAN></P>

He was a wrestler and boxer, a pothead and a diligent student. He was 'the realest dude', 'superchill', say his friends who called him 'Jahar'. 'Apparently, he's also a monster,' his wrestling coach Peter Payack says, in disbelief, in The Rolling Stone cover that stirred up controversy for making Dzhokhar Tsarnaev look like a teen idol.  &quot;There were many things about Jahar that his friends and teachers didn't know - something not unusual for immigrant children, who can live highly bifurcated lives, toggling back and forth between their ethnic and American selves,&quot; writes Janet Reitman. The two years of Jahar's life leading up to the bombing only occasionally revealed what he missed most, home. &quot;His embrace of Islam also may have been driven by something more basic: a need to belong,&quot; says Reitman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'He wants to be the best vice president ever,' says his staff. Rocking Ray-Ban aviators, Joe Biden makes 70 look like the new 60, writes Jeanne Marie Laskas. Last winter, whenever 2016 came up, it was all about Hillary. But then, Biden's public stock began to rise. When Washington was hyperventilating on the fiscal cliff, Obama sent Biden in to broker a deal. Newton happened soon after, and Obama sent Biden to talk to the NRA. &quot;In 2013, Biden has emerged more visibly potent than his boss,&quot; says Laskas. But still, 'President Biden' has a preposterous ring to it. &quot;There's a joke. Something fundamentally comical. That's where the public starts with Biden. A Biden entrance can make the stuffiest event intimate, for an instant human and vaguely...funny,&quot; writes Laskas. 'I can die a happy man never having been president of the US,' says Biden. &quot;But that doesn't mean he won't run.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">racist-in-chief?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, before the planned nationwide protests on the acquittal of George Zimmerman, US President Barack Obama made an unscripted 17-minute speech, &quot;reigniting conservative criticisms that he is an advocate for identity politics rather than for national unity&quot;, writes John Avlon. Obama said, 'Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. I think it's important to recognise that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.' By making that speech, Obama is paying a political price. &quot;There is a residual discomfort when President Obama speaks as a member of the African-American community rather than as an entirely colour-blind Commander in Chief,&quot; says Avlon. However, the conservative response calling him 'racist' is worth questioning, adds Avlon. &quot;It is a reflexive form of political judo, pre-empting an anticipated play of the race card by instead calling the first Black president 'racist', attempting to claim the high ground while cloaked in wilful historical ignorance. It is also a version of blaming the victim.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent all-female jury in Florida has decided Trayvon Martin should not receive any justice for his young life cut short by his killer. I am sure each one of them thought she made the right decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They made the decision the defense lawyers wanted them to make. The defense lawyers knew if they could create enough confusion they would prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poor jurors -- they did not know what hit them. They thought that they were following the law. They know not what they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will soon find out in their own consciences that they made the wrong decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, their ridiculous decision will rock the halls of America's justice system as being the most unjust verdict in recent modern history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The simple fact is a young man is dead not for any misfeasance on his part &quot;but for&quot; the actions of a gun-toting vigilante. This was a murder case. There is no self-defense when one party has a deadly weapon and the other party does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message this jury sent to millions of young and old, black and white people in America and the world is the same one the Supreme Court sent in the Dred Scott decision -- that Lady Justice is not blind in all situations and those people toward whom she decides not to be impartial must seek their justice through another avenue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight American presidents owned slaves while living in the White House. President Zachary Taylor pledged that his fellow slave-owners would &quot;appeal to the sword if necessary&quot; to keep them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when a president arrived at the White House briefing room to speak of his personal experience with racial bias, it stirred some historical ghosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, President Obama's 18-minute remarks did not aspire to memorable rhetoric. Rather than &quot;I have a dream,&quot; it was &quot;I have an explanation.&quot; But he explained something uncomfortable and important: How America contains within itself various experiences of promise and justice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking as president, Obama responsibly affirmed the integrity of the legal process in the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case. Speaking as an African-American, he identified with the experience of being singled out for scrutiny. He talked of being followed in department stores and of being preceded by clicking car locks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This description was more powerful for being clinical. He effectively conveyed a social reality many people seldom consider. One of the privileges of looking privileged is anonymity. One of the burdens of appearing less privileged is feeling watched -- followed by &quot;eyes that fix you,&quot; according to T.S. Eliot, &quot;in a formulated phrase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some conservatives attacked Obama for being &quot;divisive&quot; and for injecting race into the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin debate. Those criticisms were misdirected. It is perfectly appropriate for a president to apply his own history to his role as communicator and policymaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was it out of bounds for John F. Kennedy, who had a mentally disabled sister, to call for an overhaul of the nation's mental health system in 1963?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was it inappropriate for Lyndon Johnson, who grew up in Texas without electricity or indoor plumbing, to convene the National Advisory Commission on Rural Poverty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or is it only on the issue of race that a president should ignore his own background for fear of being &quot;divisive&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposite criticism is more serious -- that Obama has missed opportunities over the years to talk about race in a compelling and personal way. It is the unavoidable American issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, a third of all human beings in the South were owned by another human being. For a century beyond slavery, Jim Crow laws enforced a racial caste system. The election of an African-American president -- born three years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- is a wonder of national healing and historical compression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who can argue that we have heard too much from Obama on this topic? For five years, he strategically downplayed the reality of his own miracle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having finally engaged the issue of race, Obama drew the correct policy implication. Social divisions are deepest when it comes to African-American boys and young men: often betrayed by schools, abandoned by fathers, treated with suspicion, unable to find jobs, wandering through dysfunctional neighborhoods, locked in prison in vast numbers and denied basic civil rights (such as voting) for the rest of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama has a unique standing to address the challenges of minority youth. As a young man, he was prone to trouble and might have easily gotten enmeshed in an unforgiving legal system. The president can effectively argue that first impressions are not always correct, and that second chances are sometimes necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Obama's speech deserves this criticism: Its policy proposals -- training police, reconsidering &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws, more community dialogue and &quot;soul-searching&quot; -- were weak. It was as though the administration's policy apparatus had never really considered the matter before -- that it was somehow ambushed by America's most obvious policy challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem of African-American boys and young men is a complex mix of lingering racial prejudice, urban economic dislocation, collapsing family structure, failing schools and sick, atomized communities. But is there really nothing practical that can be done?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about providing family supports -- mentoring, fatherhood initiatives, teen pregnancy prevention and removing the Earned Income Tax Credit penalty for married couples?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about strong accountability measures to close the educational achievement gap instead of granting waivers that lower standards? How about support for faith-based institutions that reclaim lives from gangs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about prison reform, so mandatory minimum sentences are reduced? How about expanding substance abuse prevention and treatment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging a vast national division in a responsible way, as Obama has done, is not itself divisive. But healing that division will require the president to employ a presidential power he seldom uses: to drive and shape a policy debate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As inspirational as it was to hear President Obama talk last week about how the criminal justice system is &quot;disproportionately&quot; unfair to blacks, he was ironically divisive even as he addressed the importance of people coming together. <BR>The president was right when he said our legal system discounts the value of black people's lives. During a recent visit to the state prison in Concord, I saw almost no white faces among the inmates at &quot;The Farm,&quot; most of whom were doing time for drug crimes, even thoughstudies show that drug crimes are committed as often by whites as blacks.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president didn't help himself by asking whether Trayvon Martin would have been acquitted if he had profiled and killed a white person. Martin was killed not for being black but to stop him from smashing George Zimmerman's head into cement. <BR>If the president really wanted to expose racism in our legal system, he should have criticized Zimmerman's lawyers for choosing only one person of color during the jury selection process. The U.S. Supreme Court has said the government can't discriminate - but the accused has leeway to be &quot;racist&quot; in criminal litigation; a constitutionally protected &quot;right&quot; that helped O.J. Simpson and Kobe Bryant walk free. <BR>It took guts for the president to blame his own legal system for perpetuating prejudice in the name of justice, but he should have noted that as long as lawyers on behalf of people like Simpson and Bryant can extract strategic value out of racism in a court of law, it won't matter one whit that the rest of us, as the president put it, learn to &quot;squeeze&quot; bias out of our minds when we walk down a sidewalk toward a group of young black men. <BR>Put another way, the ability to play the &quot;race card&quot; to the advantage of some blacks in criminal trials worsens the problem of racism for all blacks in legal proceedings and in larger society. <BR>If the president really wanted to rid the criminal justice system of racism, he could have condemned the gratuitous use of race as a legal tactic. And he could have proposed a revision of ethical standards for defense lawyers to deter them from engaging in the exploitation of any social prejudice for strategic gain. <BR>It's difficult enough not to internalize prejudice when certain &quot;types&quot; of individuals are overrepresented in the population of people who commit certain crimes. <BR>If a recent spate of home invasions in a particular neighborhood is committed at night by young black men in hoodies, it might be unfair to assume something sinister about the next kid who shows up at night in a hoodie, but it's asking a lot to expect people to feel no worry at all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president says we should at least &quot;check in&quot; with ourselves to make sure we're being fair when we confront situations where racism might be present. I agree, but he should have added that prejudice isn't just a black vs. white problem and that we also need to &quot;check in&quot; before making biased assumptions about the credibility of rape victims, the drinking habits of the Irish, the intelligence of the disabled, etc. <BR>Three young women were recently rescued from 10 years of enslavement in chains in an Ohio basement where they were allegedly raped and tortured because they were female, but President Obama has said not a word publicly about the women's civil rights or the fact that they were targeted for inhumane atrocities based on gender. His silence implies that some people's civil rights are more important than others'. This not only undermines the integrity of the president's point about our nation's need for unity, but also pits us against each other in the hierarchy of &quot;isms.&quot; <BR>Such selectively applied leadership skills leave many people wondering whether the president's otherwise inspirational speech was not so much profound as political.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanford police said Zimmerman and another man had pulled a couple and two children from a rolled utility on a stretch of Florida highway last Thursday just metres from where Zimmerman shot Martin, 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the first known sighting of Zimmerman, 29, since he was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in the 2012 shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Zimmerman, who didn't see the crash, spoke with a deputy at the scene and then left. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News continues to be near the top in cable television in terms of the number of viewers it attracts, but it is near the top in another category, too: the median age of its audience is among the oldest in television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most of the television business -- the segment that relies on advertising -- that would be serious cause for concern because ad sales are almost always based on a target age of 25 to 54, and Fox News, for the last two years, has had a median age of 65-plus in its ratings both for the full day and for prime time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But up until now at least, Fox News has been more able than any other television entity to defy the tyranny of the demos, as they are known in the business. And the network, which has upturned traditions and expectations throughout its history, has earned consistently enormous profits, relying on the commitment and loyalty of its audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I don't think you can fully capture the value Fox News brings by looking at the Nielsen ratings alone,'' said Craig Moffett, the longtime financial analyst who specializes in cable. Mr. Moffett, who heads his own firm, said that the key to Fox News's continued financial strength has been ''the level of passion and engagement'' it inspires in its viewers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That translates into big money because cable systems now pay Fox News one of the highest per-subscriber fees in television, 94 cents a month, topped in cable television only by a few networks, most of which have expensive sports rights to pay. (By comparison, CNN gets 57 cents a subscriber, according to SNL Kagan Research.) As Mr. Moffett put it, ''There are a handful of networks consumers are deeply passionate about out of all proportion to Nielsen ratings, and distributors know if you don't have those networks, then woe be to you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With close to 100 million subscribers in total, Fox News will take in $1.11 billion this year from subscription fees before it ever sells a single commercial, Kagan estimated. Still, the network faces some significant questions as it goes forward: How old is too old? And when does the issue have to be addressed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox News declined to make executives available for comment, but several recent signs -- including changing personalities for some of its weekday programs -- suggest the network may have decided the time has come to confront the issue of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how old is its audience? It is impossible to be precise because Nielsen stops giving an exact figure for median age once it passes 65. But for six of the last eight years, Fox News has had a median age of 65-plus and the number of viewers in the 25-54 year old group has been falling consistently, down five years in a row in prime time, from an average of 557,000 viewers five years ago to 379,000 this year. That has occurred even though Fox's overall audience in prime time is up this year, to 2.02 million from 1.89 million three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network also has been faced with a recent string of nightly wins in that 25-54 audience by CNN, which had been hopelessly behind in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The numbers indicate they haven't been replacing the younger viewers,'' Mr. Moffett said of Fox News. Many of the loyal viewers the network has always had are simply aging up beyond the 54-year cutoff for many ad buyers. The result is an audience edging consistently above that 65-plus number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News audiences always trend old, and the viewers of Fox's competitors are hardly in the full flower of youth. MSNBC's median age for its prime-time shows this year is 60.6; CNN's is 59.8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the rest of television, Fox News also is quite a bit older than networks considered to have a base of older viewers. CBS has frequently been needled for having older viewers, but at 56.8, its median viewer is far younger than Fox News's. (Viewers at Fox News's sister network, Fox Broadcasting, have a median age of 50.2; at ABC, the median is 54.4; at NBC, it's 47.7.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cable, the ages range from as young as 28.9 for Comedy Central, to 39.2 for another Fox sister network, FX, 43.6 for ESPN, and 52.9 for USA. The only other networks to hit 65-plus are the game show network GSN and the rural news network RFD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The downward trend in younger viewers seems to be accelerating at Fox News. In the second quarter of this year, the network scored its lowest ratings since 2001 in the 25-54 category. And through the end of last week, CNN had squeaked ahead of Fox News for Monday through Sunday prime-time numbers in the month of July -- in that age group only, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fox continued to have more than twice as many total viewers in most cases, but, driven by its heavy concentration on the Trayvon Martin case, CNN has posted big gains for the month in the advertiser-preferred group. Last Thursday, for example, on the strength of an interview with Mr. Martin's parents, as well as a special documentary on the impending royal birth, CNN averaged 381,000 viewers in that 25-54 group to 333,000 for Fox News -- despite having more than 1.3 million fewer overall viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this a trend? CNN has had bursts of ratings glory before, based on breaking news stories, only to fall back again to noncompetitive status. This time, the CNN run has been more sustained, though even a quarter of a year is far from a distinct trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there may be some sales implications for Fox. ''You do see definitely accelerating negative trends at Fox News,'' said James Boyle, the managing director of SQAD, an advertising tracking and forecasting firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Boyle said his research indicated that the first and second quarters of this year showed declines for Fox News in sales for the ad clients he studies. ''The demos have impact over time,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tracey Riener, the senior vice president of Havas Media, which buys ad space in news programs on behalf of clients like Fidelity Investments and Choice Hotels, said, ''It's hard to ignore Fox's ratings,'' noting how the network often has double or triple the number of viewers that MSNBC and CNN have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she added, ''Median age is important For some clients, getting old is a concern. But for some clients looking for people close to retirement age or living in retirement, I would say the group 35 to 60 is still important.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent moves may be the best indicator of how Fox News is responding to the audience trends. The network announced early this month that one of its rising stars, Megyn Kelly, will be moving into its prime-time lineup later this summer; and it hired Elisabeth Hasselbeck to join its top-rated cable morning show ''Fox and Friends.'' Both women are considerably younger than the network's continuing hosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Moffett said the most successful brands always had to be aware of reinventing themselves for the next generation. He cited the example of Cadillac.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It was amazing,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''You could see the average Cadillac buyer was getting one year older every year. It didn't take a lot of math skills to realize if nothing changed, one day the last Cadillac buyer was going to walk into the showroom and then drop dead on the way out.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jet magazine is getting a makeover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the magazine's owner, Johnson Publishing, announced a complete redesign for Jet in print and online -- the first in the 62 years of the publication, long a staple in the black community. The new look for Jet includes brighter colors against a white background, more informational graphics, larger photos and new fonts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a year and a half ago, its sister publication, Ebony, unveiled an online redesign of its own, which was preceded by a print redesign. Since then, traffic to Ebony.com has increased substantially to more than 600,000 visitors in July from less than 100,000 visitors a year ago, said Desiree Rogers, the chief executive of Johnson Publishing, who is hoping for a similar bounce at Jet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''People really did feel that it was time for a little bit of a makeover here,'' said Desir&Atilde;&copy;e Rogers, the chief executive of Johnson Publishing. ''These brands have been around for almost 70 years. You've got to change with the times.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the redesign, the Web sites Ebony.com and Jetmag.com will each link to the other's Web site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ebony redesign may also have helped the magazine's advertising. The number of ad pages increased 4.2 percent from the second quarter in 2012 to the second quarter in 2013. Revenue from advertising also increased to $13.6 million in the second quarter of 2013 from $11.7 million in that quarter a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad revenue for Jet magazine increased a slight 2 percent in the second quarter in 2013, to $2.7 million, up from $2.62 million a year earlier, while the number of ad pages dipped 7.8 percent in the same time period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the redesigned Jet will keep some of its franchises -- including its ''Beauty of the Week'' feature -- it will also include condensed sections that focus on celebrity, news, entertainment and lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes will also be felt in the editorial content, with Jet writers doing more original reporting and less aggregation, said Mitzi Miller, the magazine's editor in chief. ''Magazines in general are trying to figure out how we stay relevant,'' Ms. Miller said. ''We have a clearly defined voice again so when people come here they say 'O.K. this is a Jet position.'&acirc;[#x20ac][0/00]''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aug. 12 issue -- which reflects the new design -- has on the cover Octavia Spencer and Michael B. Jordan, the stars of the film ''Fruitvale Station,'' which is based on a 2009 incident when a black man was shot and killed by a police officer in an Oakland subway station. The film has gotten particular attention because its release coincided with the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Miller said the magazine would also offer more service journalism for its readers. ''It's also about how can you get Beyonc&Atilde;&copy;'s look for less,'' she said. ''When you have her clothes, here are the top five detergents you need to get the stain out of that blouse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also offer short videos for users' mobile phones. In the August issue, Ms. Miller added such a video to her editor's letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing that won't change, however, is the magazine's unusual size -- 5&acirc;...[#x203a] inches by 7&acirc;...oe inches. Ms. Rogers said the magazine enlisted the opinions of focus groups around the country for ideas on the makeover. ''The one thing we kept hearing was, 'Don't change my size,'&acirc;[#x20ac][0/00]'' she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President Obama is restarting a major effort this week to focus public attention on the American economy, a strategy aimed at giving him credit for the improving job market and lifting his rhetoric beyond the Beltway squabbles that have often consumed his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new effort, which begins with a major address on Wednesday followed by as many as six economic-themed speeches over the next two months, reflects how often world events, his political adversaries and his own competing agenda have conspired to knock him off that subject. Republicans were already mocking Mr. Obama on Monday, noting that his speeches were among many campaign-style efforts over the last five years to jump-start an economic conversation with Americans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States economy has grown steadily but slowly for more than four years, with home prices, stocks and retail sales rebounding from their lows in 2009. The economic growth has not resulted in large job gains, but there has been a turnaround in longstanding pessimism among Americans about their financial futures. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in early June found Americans increasingly positive in their views of the nation's economy. Nearly 4 in 10 in the poll said the condition of the economy was very good or fairly good, the most in Mr. Obama's presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have come a long way since the depths of the Great Recession,'' Jay Carney, the president's spokesman, said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the White House strategy brings risks, given that the economy is not yet close to full recovery from the financial crisis. Mr. Carney quickly added that ''we have more work to do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as they sought to build anticipation for Mr. Obama's address at Knox College in Illinois on Wednesday, White House officials acknowledged the constraints on the president, especially since political gridlock in Washington has persisted through dozens of previous efforts at public outreach by Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic speeches will not contain sweeping new proposals, senior administration officials said Monday. Nor are they intended to break the hardening stalemate on economic issues between the president and his Republican adversaries in Congress. Instead, they are largely repackaged economic proposals that the president has offered for years. Aides said they did not anticipate the speeches leading to a breakthrough with Republicans on looming fiscal fights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That admission may suggest that the president's advisers recognize how little the president -- any president -- can do to alter the country's economic trajectory when global forces increasingly shape the financial system in the United States and the domestic political system has ground to a standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Congress, House and Senate spending bills for the coming fiscal year are so far apart that few lawmakers believe common ground can be found to pass them. Instead, the government may have to be financed come October by a stopgap measure that largely keeps spending at current levels with no changes to meet Mr. Obama's priorities -- and both sides say even that is likely to be problematic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's adversaries on Monday were quick to point out that the president has frequently set out on similar campaign-style efforts to redefine or restate his economic agenda, often accompanied by rhetoric from his advisers about a new direction or emphasis. Congressional Republicans said they were incredulous that Mr. Obama planned to use another set of speeches instead of legislative negotiations to advance his economic agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's a clich&eacute;, but if all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio. ''They don't know how to do anything else.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fall of 2011, Mr. Obama addressed a joint session of Congress to unveil a $447 billion jobs bill that has not passed. In 2012, as his re-election campaign neared its end, he renewed his vision with a 20-page economic plan. In his State of the Union address in February, the president refocused on the economy after beginning his second term focused on gun control, immigration, climate change and gay rights. And just this past May, Mr. Obama announced he was restarting his ''Middle Class Jobs and Opportunity Tour,'' with stops in Baltimore and Austin, Tex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They've been saying the same thing for four years,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate. ''The previous Democrat Congress passed his agenda -- Obamacare, the stimulus, thousands of pages of regulations -- and the economy is treading water. More taxes, more regulation, and more failures to unleash American energy jobs are not the answer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials on Monday conceded that the president was partly to blame for the debates in Washington veering away from the economic issues that many Americans believe are the most important. One official said that it was incumbent on Mr. Obama to shift the overall focus of the conversation in Washington, but acknowledged that has not happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials also criticized Republicans, especially in the House, for seizing on what the White House says are overblown scandals: the targeting of nonprofit groups at the Internal Revenue Service and the actions of officials after the attacks in Benghazi, Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said that some of the distractions in Washington have been out of Mr. Obama's control: the 2010 oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico; Hurricane Sandy's destruction late last year and the tornadoes in Oklahoma City in May; tensions in the Middle East and even the Trayvon Martin verdict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administration officials said the timing of the president's speeches was broadly related to the looming fiscal deadlines that are likely to cause bitter fights in Congress later this fall. But they said the president wanted to avoid using the speeches as a negotiating platform over legislative programs, saying he would not offer a to-do list for Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Our economic vision is not focused solely on the skirmishes that occur on Capitol Hill,'' Mr. Carney told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's adversaries in Congress are nonetheless eager to engage him in the trenches. Spending bills winding their way through the House threaten to do profound damage to the president's priorities. Although Mr. Obama has said he will not negotiate terms to raise the nation's debt limit, Congressional Republicans say they will not let the deadline pass without concessions, either on programs like Medicare or on an overhaul of the tax code.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''President Offers a Personal Take on Race in U.S.'' (front page, July 20):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sharing his thoughts on race relations in this country after the verdict in the trial of George Zimmerman, President Obama earned a newfound respect from millions of Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama clearly felt strongly enough that he was compelled to speak on a very personal and honest basis about an issue that most of us would rather avoid discussing. I applaud him for courageously stepping forward and in a measured and carefully thought-out way talking about a topic that desperately deserves the nation's attention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope the president's words are a first step in a new era in which Americans start to discuss with one another the issue of race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALAN SAFRON Woodcliff Lake, N.J., July 20, 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm a 34-year-old black man. I hold a graduate degree, and I've never been incarcerated. I don't engage in any criminal activity. But, like the president, I know what it's like to be followed in stores and to hear car doors lock. I know what it's like to have women nervously clutch their purses or walk at a quickened pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been followed by the police. I also know what it's like to be ''stopped and frisked'' by police officers in Harlem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama acknowledged the fact that young males like Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, statistically speaking, are more likely to be killed as a result of black-on-black crime. If people think that black mothers and fathers hurt more or less because the murderer of their child is a black person or a white Hispanic, they have an awful lot of soul-searching to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black parents want what all parents want -- their children to be safe and not viewed with suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IAN PETERKIN Bridgeport, Conn., July 21, 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's remarks on the trial of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin paid lip service to the legitimacy of jury verdicts, but in context marginalized the primacy of American procedural justice. The context of the president's remarks was that something is badly wrong with a system that would acquit Mr. Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former lecturer in constitutional law, the president engaged in a stunning diminishment of American judicial process, the jewel in our legal system, which would rather acquit many guilty people than convict one innocent person. Americans who attend to President Obama's remarks will feel vindicated in a belief that the court system is just another fixed game, fueling the cynicism of those who would rather control outcomes than preserve the protections that are the envy of the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writer is a professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama articulated what has long been a day-to-day experience for many African-American males. One gets up each morning never quite knowing how many assaults on one's dignity as a man will be endured before the day's end. His examples are commonplace, manifesting themselves countless times across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech carried the weight of his office, yet was delivered as a black man who identifies with the continuing struggles of every black man. I was deeply moved and am so very proud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KENNETH WESLEY LIVINGSTON Woodland Hills, Calif., July 20, 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While African-Americans have a singular relationship to the history evoked by the verdict in Florida, the pain it caused is not restricted to the African-American community. To overlook the anguish of Americans of every racial and ethnic background risks yielding the national conversation to those who would further divide us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAIA ETTINGER Guilford, Conn., July 20, 2013</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Genuine as his words were, President Obama waited until he was forced to talk about race in America, rather than begin a conversation when he first took office. Now his words will fade away with the next news cycle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rich Lowry's piece on the nation's current obsession with the result of George Zimmerman's trial is an oasis of common sense in an otherwise baseless debate (&quot;The National Conversation on Race,&quot; Post&shy;Opinion, July 19).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those who closely followed the trial were not surprised by its outcome. Nor were they eager to accept the misguided notion that it was all about race. It was about an extremely unfortunate sequence of events involving two minority individuals, which ended badly for both of them. One is dead, the other forever a marked man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the presumption of guilt due to a media-inflamed racial narrative that got us where we are today. The jurors had every opportunity to accommodate the racial agenda, but decided not to do so. Good for them. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lowry's column should be widely shared by every Post reader.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The only idiocy Lowry left out was the Rev. Jesse Jackson's suggestion of a UN investigation into the tragedy.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For President Obama to say that he could have been Trayvon&nbsp;Martin is an absolute disgrace (&quot; 'Trayvon Could Have Been Me,' &quot; July 20).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the president to use politics in this sensitive case is nauseating. Obama will do whatever it takes to place himself in the spotlight.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The former suspect, who gained infamy by killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, stopped Wednesday when he saw an overturned vehicle, Seminole County sheriff's spokeswoman Heather Smith said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crash happened at 5:45 p.m. Wednesday at Interstate 4 and Route 417, less than a mile from where Zimmerman killed Martin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman helped two parents and two children out of their blue Ford Explorer, where they were momentarily trapped, authorities said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When deputies arrived, &quot;two men - one of whom was George Zimmerman - had already helped assist the family by getting them out of the overturned vehicle,&quot; Smith said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The four family members were not injured. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zimmerman hasn't been seen in public since jurors declared him not guilty July 13, sparking protests across the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Neighborhood-watch volunteer Zimmerman mistook Martin for a burglar on Feb. 26, 2012. The two got into a confrontation that ended with Zimmerman shooting Martin. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MILWAUKEE (AP) A 76-year-old U.S. man who fatally shot his black 13-year-old neighbor in the chest after accusing the boy of burglary was sentenced Monday to life in prison with no chance of parole. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John H. Spooner, who was convicted last week of first-degree intentional homicide, acknowledged shooting Darius Simmons last year while the teen&quot;s mother watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conviction carried a mandatory sentence of life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has drawn some parallels to that of the deadly shooting of black teen Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman after a Florida confrontation. Zimmerman, however, was acquitted amid protests across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Spooner&quot;s shotguns were stolen in a break-in at his home in May 2012, and he told the jury he suspected Darius as the thief. Footage from Spooner&quot;s own surveillance cameras two days later showed him confronting Darius on the sidewalk, pointing a gun at the boy&quot;s chest and firing. Darius turned and fled, then collapsed and died in the street moments later as his mother cradled him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police searched the boy&quot;s home later that day and didn&quot;t find the weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darius&quot; mother, Patricia Larry, has a wrongful-death lawsuit pending against Spooner. After jurors rejected Spooner&quot;s insanity plea on Friday, she told reporters &quot;justice was served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spooner never denied shooting the boy. He testified, against his attorney&quot;s advice, that he killed Darius because he really wanted his guns back. He also acknowledged wanting to kill the teen&quot;s brother when the older boy ran to Darius&quot; aid as he lay dying. But Spooner said he didn&quot;t want to hit any of the others who had gathered around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When prosecutor Mark Williams suggested Spooner killed Darius for revenge, Spooner replied, &quot;I wouldn&quot;t call it revenge. I would call it justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event drew about 275 people, an organizer, Carroll E. Brown of West Haven, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens stood when asked if they felt more vulnerable in the wake of the verdict. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking across the audience, the facilitator, the Rev. Dr. Jerry Streets, said, &quot;We have people of different ethnic backgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not a white race, we're not a black race, we are a human race,&quot; said Streets, senior pastor of Dixwell Avenue Congregational United Church of Church, where the Monday evening program was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers were Assistant Police Chief Thaddeus Reddish; Onya Harris, president of New Haven Black Social Workers Association; Teddy Brown Sr., retired detective sergeant, West Haven Police Department; and the Rev. Keith A. King, an attorney, prosecutor and senior pastor of Christian Tabernacle Baptist Church, Hamden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each offered some guidance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddish said, &quot;It's not the George Zimmermans that are killing the black males. It's our own black males that are killing black males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our problem is not Zimmerman. Our problem is not 'stand your ground.' Our problem is our youth who have no respect for each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers in New Haven are part of the community, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddish recalled seeing a man on a bike with a gun in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He &quot;pulled the gun out and put it on my face and pulled the trigger. It was a Glock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gun failed to go off. There was a foot chase; opportunity to shoot the man who tried to kill him. The man went to prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see him now with his little kids walking on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Connecticut law said I could use deadly force, but I didn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddish's family of civil rights workers in the South were &quot;totally against&quot; his being a cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I uphold the laws of the state of Connecticut, and it's up to you to change the laws,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like President Barack Obama, King said he encountered racism early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fifth-grade, I recall having a good friend who happened to be white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While his friend's mother was not home, they hung out together at the boy's house until one day the boy's brother came home and saw King was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was in shock,&quot; King said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that, he was never allowed back at the friend's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His family told him: '&quot;You were not allowed because they found out you were black.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offered the following suggestions to African-Americans: get voting up to 80 to 90 percent; increase diversity in every area of law enforcement; and &quot;recommit to the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very rarely,&quot; King said, did he see a &quot;daddy in the courtroom,&quot; when a young African-American man was being prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris noted, &quot;We need more African-American therapists working with African-American boys,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim is to &quot;wipe the face of despair off them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of young men are stricken with depression, but we see it as aggression,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also identified women who are victims of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, the former officer, addressed the Zimmerman trial for shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a sloppy investigation,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at this trial, who was being tried?&quot; he asked the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trayvon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was trained at the Police Academy, Brown said, shooting targets were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he got out on the street, he looked at blacks in the same way, &quot;because I was programmed to think like that,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the story, &quot;Volusia manager pitches tax rate increase,&quot; of July 13:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess Volusia County Manager Jim Dinneen and the County Council members don't get it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are the second-highest taxed county in the state of Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the county's property tax rate increases anywhere from 3.7 percent to 7.4 percent, it will discourage people from choosing our county as a place to live, and create an exodus when people can no longer afford to stay. I can see the headlines in the upcoming months: Volusia County, the highest-taxed county in Florida. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a distinction!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for the follow-up article &quot;Fatal crash: Biker didn't slow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, John Ward was a biker -- yet he was so much more to those whose lives he touched by his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am fortunate to be a part of Audrey and John's lives, and shall always try to live and be guided by their love.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida's shame on display</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in Florida would the aggressor in a confrontation walk away a free man after killing an unarmed minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in Florida would a woman fearing for her life, standing her ground, but not killing her aggressor, go to prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should all be ashamed of our Florida government, all branches: the legislative, the executive, the judicial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KATHLEEN D. BARTOS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Smyrna Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, no agitators here</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly why is it that Al Sharpton organized a rally here? While not everyone agrees with the verdict in the Zimmerman/Martin trial, the people in Central Florida have been respectful and civil regarding the outcome. We do not need an agitator like him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Zimmerman was declared not guilty of breaking any laws in the state of Florida. No more taxpayer money needs to be wasted on a case that has already been resolved. It is sad for the Martin family to lose a son, and politically incorrect to speak ill of the dead. The jury has said that not one thing George Zimmerman did was a crime under Florida law. If Al Sharpton doesn't like the laws of this state, he doesn't need to come here. No loss!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ormond Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A final reckoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another travesty of justice has just happened here. George Zimmerman is the third person to have gotten away with a killing in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the day of judgment comes, no silver-tongued lawyers will be able to intervene. I can hardly wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARRIET S. HILL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Smyrna Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why single this case out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case, I think that Cal Thomas' column in The News-Journal earlier this week sums it all up. He wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your view would be reinforced by a case in Georgia in which four African-American teenagers beat a 36-year-old white man as he emerged from a gas station convenience store. While trying to escape, the man stumbled into the middle lane of a highway where he was struck by a car and killed. The Marietta Daily Journal reported that the four are charged with felony murder, aggravated assault and violation of the Georgia Street Gang Act. The incident occurred two weeks ago, but I have seen no national media coverage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has happened to our news reporting journalists? God help us all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daytona Beach Shores</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressing a divisive issue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a staunch supporter of President Obama, I'm conflicted on what to make of his public statements about the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin case and racism in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all have the God-given right to our own opinions and the right to protest peacefully. That said, personalities such as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson are digging a hole that might be hard to climb out of. If one of these so-called protests turns violent and innocent people are hurt or killed, who will be to blame? That's why I'm conflicted with our president almost picking sides on this troubling issue facing our great nation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ormond Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough trial coverage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much longer are we going to be subjected to this Zimmerman trial torture? Enough already!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is so much more important news in the world. Can't the TV stations put that on the back burner for awhile?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I used to watch Channel 13 news. They give the gist of a story and send you to the web page for the rest of it. Not so with the Zimmerman story. It seems as though they are trying to rile the people up by keeping the story on the air, day and night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know for a fact that many people besides my wife and I are sick of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education vote revealing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives voted on HR 5, a bill that would greatly diminish the federal role in K-12 education, increase state and local authority over schools and freeze education spending at sequestration levels for several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This passed in a party-line vote and went to the U.S. Senate. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Jacksonville, voted &quot;no,&quot; while Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Ponte Vedra Beach, and Rep. John Mica, R-Winter Park, voted &quot;yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this mean in terms of their political ideology beliefs? The Democrats continue to believe in federal government control of every aspect of our lives, to include the indoctrination of our children via federally mandated school programs, while the Republicans continue to believe that the best government is local government. While many citizens have become both used to and dependent upon federal control of their lives, I argue that it is not the best path for a free society. I applaud the House Republican majority for faithfully representing the people.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUNNELL -- Undaunted by a torrential afternoon rain, the protesters kept moving. The Walk for Dignity began Monday in Jacksonville and 30 or so participants weren't going to let Mother Nature slow their efforts. They spent Monday night in St. Augustine before making their way through Flagler County on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters say they are addressing the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial earlier this month and hope to shed more light on the conviction of Marissa Alexander, who fired a warning shot at her husband, whom she alleged had subjected her to constant physical abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many see Alexander, who is black, as someone who was more justified to argue a stand-your-ground defense than Zimmerman, who shot and killed Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, in a Sanford neighborhood last year. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder while Alexander is serving a 20-year prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-day cross-counties protest -- comprised of residents from various Southern states including Florida -- began in Jacksonville and will culminate with an assembly Saturday in Sanford, organizers say. The participants spent Tuesday night at Zion Baptist Church of Palm Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hoping for some way to contribute and to give back to this effort,&quot; said Rev. Charlene Cothran, pastor at Zion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan for those taking part in the Walk for Dignity is to spend Wednesday night in Flagler Beach, walk Thursday into Volusia and find a place to stay that night in the Daytona Beach area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Friday night, the walkers hope to arrive at Hickory Avenue Church of God in Sanford, wake up the following morning and take part in a daylong rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The walkers' persistence didn't go unnoticed by passers-by Tuesday. One woman entered a gas station in St. Augustine and walked out cradling bottles of water, handing them out to the protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aleta Alston-Toure, one of the organizers, said their efforts have generated appreciation and admiration. The hot, muggy and rainy conditions have actually inspired the protesters to keep going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their job, she said, is to bring to light the need for more social justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alston-Toure said the walkers mapped out a route to take but they're relying on the good will of others to provide places to stay. They also hope to find a place to shower. Most importantly, they want to spread the word of their cause and spur more support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're hoping this just keeps getting bigger and bigger as we go,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers said Saturday's rally will be streamed live online at southtosouth.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weather: It just won't stop. The rain continues again today, with a 50 percent chance of thunderstorms and a high near 86. Tonight's low will fall to the lower 70s with a 40 percent chance of storms. Wednesday will be a copy of today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At long last -- pavement. The residents of Liberty Crossing subdivision in Kimberly finally got their streets paved, ending a long-running dispute with residents and the Kimberly City Council on one side and developer Clint Singletary on the other. The city had imposed an end-of-summer deadline on Singletary before it cashed in the performance bond on the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a boy, and a future king. Prince William and wife Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, are now the parents of a bouncing baby boy weighing 8 pounds, 6 ounces. The baby was born Monday at 4:24 p.m. local time (10:24 a.m. our time). No name has been announced yet for the boy, who will be third in line for the British throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman is back. But this time, the Florida man is credited with helping save a family of four trapped in an SUV that had rolled over on Interstate 4 near Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman, who was acquitted days ago of second-degree murder charges in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, had been in hiding since the verdict was handed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports: Braun gone. Major League Baseball has suspended Milwaukee's Ryan Braun for the rest of the season, for what was called &quot;violations of the Basic Agreement and its Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.&quot; Braun was implicated in using performance-enhancing drugs associated with the company Biogenesis, which has ties to several other MLB players who are expected to face long suspensions over the next few days. Among them: New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez... Meanwhile, Jason Heyward was the star for the Braves, as his laid-out diving catch in center field with two outs in the bottom of the ninth clinched the 2-1 win over the Mets. Atlanta scored twice in the top of the ninth for the comeback win.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OROVILLE -- People marched with the Butte County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Tuesday to protest laws that allowed George Zimmerman to be acquitted of second-degree murder for shooting Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed self-defense in the 2012 shooting of the teenager in a gated community in Florida where Martin was staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jury found Zimmerman not guilty in Seminole Circuit Court in Florida on July 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local NAACP, Unit 1029, led the march. Protesters started at the northwest corner of Home Depot, crossing Nelson Avenue and marching up County Center Drive toward the Butte County Superior Courthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAACP President Irma Jordan called for a peaceable march. Jordan and Pastor Kevin Thompson of the Number One Church of God in Christ led the marchers singing, &quot;We are standing for justice. We will not be stopped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group gathered on the steps of the courthouse. Jordan said the Zimmerman trial is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot go back, but we can stop other Trayvon&nbsp;Martin shootings from happening,&quot; Jordan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan said, &quot;We all have the same rights given by God, and the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin verdict was unfair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan asked people to support changes including of the &quot;Stand Your Ground&quot; laws on self-defense, racial and other profiling, and the removal of a section of the Voting Rights Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, the United States Supreme Court voted to remove the section of the Voting Rights Act that requires places with a history of discrimination to get approval before changing the way elections are held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Harrison, pastor of the New Home Missionary Baptist Church, said the Zimmerman case includes all the elements required for a United States Department of Justice investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Florida authorities have delivered all evidence related to the Zimmerman investigation to federal officials, who are weighing whether to pursue a civil rights case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celia Hirschman of the Historic Downtown Oroville Neighborhood Watch said they do not support violence by neighborhood watch volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not support what Zimmerman did,&quot; Hirschman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan handed out packets of information people can use to protest laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seng Yang, of the Hmong Cultural Center of Butte County, also spoke about supporting equal justice for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Bradford, born and raised in Oroville, came from Sacramento to participate in the march to support changes in laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bradford said a lot of African-American youth in Florida and other areas are living in fear in the aftermath of the Zimmerman trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's leading to a gateway for things like that (the Martin shooting) to happen again,&quot; Bradford said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shackles basically came off Friday when President Barack Obama delivered his &quot;Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me&quot; remarks about the ugly black experience in the United States and urged his fellow Americans to acknowledge its reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a remarkably atypical statement from Obama, the ultracautious, &quot;post-racial&quot; president who had shied away from any discussion of race throughout his presidency. But the more remarkable thing about the statement is that he delivered it not just as president, but as a black man. And he did it at a time when passions were inflamed and the country was deeply divided over the acquittal of George Zimmerman for killing unarmed black teenager Trayvon&nbsp;Martin. It is the kind of speech political aides are loath to counsel, and Obama would never have dared make the remarks in his first term, fearful as he was about alienating the voters in Middle America who made him the first black president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I suspect that deep in some corner of his heart, Obama knew the narrative about a post-racial America just wasn't going to hold water for long. At some point, Obama knew he would have to address the volatile issue of race relations, and in death, Trayvon&nbsp;Martin liberated him and helped him find his voice. There could never be a better case than the one about the tragic death of this black teenager to open the door for a conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By and large, young black men, in the U.S. especially, have two images: they are either sports and entertainment icons, or they are gun-toting thugs. They make millions of dollars and flaunt it, or they gun each other down. There is usually very little middle ground between the two narratives. But in Trayvon&nbsp;Martin, you have a case that defies conventional wisdom. An unarmed teenager on his way home in the rain and breaking no laws, is profiled by a white adult, followed, and in the ensuing altercation, ends up dead. The man who did the chasing and the shooting is then set free by a jury. The outrage in the black community is palpable, and if Obama was ever going to speak on the volatile issue of race relations, here was his chance. He took it with a vengeance in explaining why the verdict hit such a raw nerve in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke candidly, fearlessly, taking on what would normally be taboo subjects. He was effective because he spoke from the heart in a very personal way. He spoke about racial profiling and of his experiences as a young black man. He acknowledged the high crime rate among young African-Americans, but he put it in the context of the historic poverty in black communities that has contributed to marginalization of the youth. And he lamented the injustices of a legal system that treats blacks worse than it does others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The African-American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of criminal laws - everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he gave voice to the belief of many African-Americans that the Zimmerman case had racist undertones from beginning to end when he noted that, &quot;If a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different.&quot; This was Obama unglued, and in terms of significance, his statement - it was not really a speech - was far more profound and historic in terms of race relations than the 2008 speech he delivered in the wake of his former pastor Jeremiah Wright's incendiary observations about the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Obama the candidate was fighting for his political life when he made that speech explaining the complexity of race relations and the residual pain that led to Wright's admittedly offensive comments. In 2013, there was no political high-wire act to perform. There was no straddling the middle, and he spoke as a &quot;brother,&quot; directly to the African-American experience, and validated it. And he challenged Middle America to acknowledge it. If you were a young black man and you heard Obama speak or read his statement, you saw it as an acknowledgment and affirmation of your life experience by the president of the United States. This was not some no-good young African-American complaining, it is the president telling the world that he understands it because he has lived it. Here was the president identifying with you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other thing about Friday is that Obama was also addressing the broader American society. He was telling them that the black experience may not be their experience, it may not be their life, but it is real, and they should not dismiss it. That's why he called for self-analysis by all Americans. &quot;I think it is going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching ... At least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can? Am I judging people as much as I can, based on not the colour of their skin, but the content of their character? That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy,&quot; Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a child of an interracial marriage who wrote about not being sure where he belonged growing up, but who became the first black president and studiously avoided talking about race, last Friday was Obama's epiphany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone agrees with Obama's observations, and there has been criticism. But he spoke about race relations in a way that will reverberate for a long time to come.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a sit-in by protesters in Rick Scott's office entering its second week, the governor Monday sent his top juvenile justice official to meet with those gathered to try to ease tensions roused by the George Zimmerman acquittal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wansley Walters, Scott's Department of Juvenile Justice secretary, spent most of the day listening to complaints about racial profiling and a classroom-to-prison pipeline that activists say plagues minority communities, as well as the need for ending zero-tolerance punishment in schools. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walters defended the administration, citing statistics showing a 23 percent drop in delinquency arrests over the past two years and an $11 million boost in state aid for community programs aimed at keeping kids out of trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walters also tried to win over an audience clearly skeptical of Scott and fellow state Republican leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the concerns you shared are shared by Governor Scott and the administration,&quot; Walters told the two dozen activists gathered at the governor's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After about four hours of exchanges, Gabe Pendes, an organizer with Dream Defenders, which has been leading the sit-in, told Walters the group appreciated the session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that activists have no plans to end the protest, which began July 16 and has transformed the Capitol's main floor into a combination dining room and bunkhouse for those encamped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have more things in common than we have differences,&quot; Pendes said. &quot;But what is lacking is the political will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott has already rejected the protesters' prime demand: a special session of the Legislature to repeal the state's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The no-retreat, self-defense measure, approved in 2005, was not used by Zimmerman in fighting second-degree murder charges in the death of teenager Trayvon Martin. But the measure did shape instructions given by the judge to jurors who acquitted Zimmerman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott on Monday was making appearances elsewhere in Florida, as he has every day since the protest began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was spotted briefly at the Capitol on Thursday, when he returned for a hastily arranged, 45-minute nighttime meeting with seven activist leaders. Scott told them that he supported the stand your ground law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, after huddling with Walters at DJJ headquarters and sending her to the Capitol, Scott reiterated his position to reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've asked for something that you know I'm not going to do,&quot; Scott said of protesters. &quot;I'm not going to call a special session.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the special session not a subject of discussion with Walters, the focus by activists on juvenile justice measures also is shaded by Martin's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teenager had been suspended from school in Miami for various offenses three times in the months before his death. And activists Thursday found fault with steps taken so far by Scott and the Legislature to ease harsh punishment of young offenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They criticized Scott for signing into law legislation in 2011 that allowed counties to operate detention centers without oversight by the DJJ, although state officials said that only Pasco County has moved ahead with such a facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DJJ's new civil citation program, aimed at giving first-time misdemeanor youth offenders a chance to avoid arrest, also was called a &quot;Band-Aid&quot; approach to a larger problem affecting minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may not know all the lingo of the Legislature or agencies,&quot; said Melanie Andrade, a Florida A&amp;M University student and the leader of the school's Dream Defender chapter. &quot;But we know these kids, and we understand things from a very different point of view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrade told Walters that state officials, school administrators and law enforcement officers look only one way at a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to meet us on our page,&quot; Andrade said. &quot;All we are hearing is what works for you. That's how you see things. And I think that's where the real issue lies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of those gathered at the Capitol has varied, topping 100 at least a couple of days, but usually hovering around 35 to 50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, about 25 protesters were locked inside the closed Capitol after supplies of water, food and changes of clothing were carted in by volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gretl Plessinger, a Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman, said Capitol police have doubled their staffing and canceled days off while the sit-in continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Scott and police have not indicated they intend to force the protesters from the Capitol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During working hours on weekdays, activists can easily exit and enter the Capitol. Some downtown Tallahassee churches have opened their doors to allow those involved in the sit-in to shower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharon Russell -- whose son, Adam, is a Florida State University student who has been sitting in at the Capitol -- has helped organize deliveries of supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some restaurants have donated food, Russell said. But she and other volunteer leaders have accepted contributions using the website PayPal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moms are going to watch out for these people,&quot; Russell said. &quot;But they are doing the right thing. They're making a difference. And we're hearing it from people who call.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lobby of the governor's office is an attractive target for sit-ins. On the first floor of the 22-story Capitol, it's highly visible and symbolically potent. Oftentimes, though, it's better suited to getting headlines than direct results, as the sit-in over Florida's &quot;stand your ground&quot; law shows. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters arrived a week ago today, three days after a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty of murdering Trayvon&nbsp;Martin in Sanford last year. They have vowed not to leave until Gov. Rick Scott calls a special legislative session to repeal the controversial self-defense law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the chances of that happening are close to zero, as Gov. Scott has said. Indeed, calling a special session would be an empty exercise, since there's little indication that the Legislature has any interest in repealing or significantly altering the law. If change is going to come, it has to begin at the ballot box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a great deal to dislike about stand your ground, which was the first of its kind when state legislators approved it in 2005. The law removed the requirement that people, outside their home, try to escape a dangerous situation before using force to defend themselves. There was outcry when it was passed, but it faded quickly, even as the law began to be used across the state to help prevent arrests and convictions in dozens of homicide cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin changed all of that. While Mr. Zimmerman did not raise a stand-your-ground defense in court, the law's self-defense protections are so broad that they initially prompted prosecutors not to charge him, triggering widespread protests. Since then, the law has received the sort of scrutiny it should have had before it was passed, with President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder among the many now calling for reviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional self-defense laws are necessary, but the stand your ground law takes them to an absurd extent. By removing the requirement that people try to avoid confrontations before acting, the law encourages aggression, making it more likely that people will die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When people do die, investigating these cases is more difficult than ever. As Mr. Martin's death underscored, claims of self-defense are easy to make and difficult to disprove when only one person survives. An investigation by The Tampa Bay Times last year found that the law had helped drug dealers and gang members go free after killing rivals. The Times cited cases in which people used the law to escape punishment after shooting others in the back or while they were on the ground. If no changes are made, these sorts of cases will keep occurring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, if not repealed outright, should be amended so that people who provoke a confrontation cannot easily invoke it in a self-defense claim. With sufficient political pressure, this can happen. Outcry over changes in the state's voting laws forced legislators this year to repeal them. It can happen again if those who oppose this dangerous law channel their frustration into campaigns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When less than 15 percent of the population commits the majority of crime, what are rational people supposed to do? As a retired New York City police lieutenant, I would be remiss if I didn't advise family and friends to be aware and cautious when coming in contact with a group that is responsible for that amount of crime. The problem is when the black community chooses to blame its problems on others, instead of reducing crime committed by its race.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I, like anyone else who is not a member of the &quot;progressive establishment,&quot; can be castigated as an evil person. This in spite of a history of showing compassion and support for minorities. Where's the fairness in this?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama didn't like taste of justice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So our president in his first attempt last year to inject racism into the Trayvon&nbsp;Martin story says, &quot;Trayvon could have been my son.&quot; Then he shut up for a while, at least on this matter, until justice was served. He didn't like the taste of it, and now says, &quot;Trayvon could have been me 35 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really, Mr. President? You were a thug in your teen years and would raise your son that way?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot imagine the pain a mother and father must feel when they are faced with the unexpected death of a son or daughter. My prayers go out to the parents of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin and to every other parent who has lost a child due to an act of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there was zero evidence that indicated this tragedy was a racial incident. As tragic as this loss of life was, it seems to have become a rallying point for extremists, especially those who only see black or white. I applaud the many blacks and whites who called for peaceful demonstrations to express their concerns and to call for dialogue as a means to bring a better understanding between races. I am saddened, disappointed and even a bit angry at the mindless racist rhetoric spewed by people like the Rev. Al Sharpton and others who seem more interested in keeping their tired and angry faces in the public eye by calling for nationwide demonstrations and a boycott of Florida.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Case shows pain of stereotyping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can't imagine the horror that the Martin family must have felt when they found out that their son had been shot. The problem, though, wasn't that a black kid was out walking in the rain that night. The problem is that our politicians do not have the guts to toughen the gun laws, so everyone who wants to can get one and carry it around, like George Zimmerman did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know first-hand what it is like to face prejudice. When my parents decided to buy a house in 1953 in a nice development in New Jersey, six of the 16 families on the street put their homes up for sale because the Jews were moving in, and we were going to ruin the neighborhood. As a very young boy, I would get beaten up because I was Jewish. As a businessman, I have been questioned by a supplier if I enjoy &quot;Jewing people down.&quot; I have heard people I thought were friends refer to Cadillacs as &quot;Jewmobiles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stereotyping people, whether it be over color, religion or sex, is very dangerous, hurtful and stupid. Let's stop using the race card, and start using compassion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time to talk about guns, not race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Barack Obama said, &quot;I could have been Trayvon.&quot; By the same reasoning, he could have been O.J. Simpson, but I can't believe he would have been so vicious as to slaughter his ex-wife and her friend with a big knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, I doubt that he would have attacked George Zimmerman, though he would have had provocation. Let's talk about guns, not race. With stricter gun controls, Trayvon would be alive, and George Zimmerman would be in the hospital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifty years ago, when I was a kid growing up in the South, a white man could pick a fight with a black man, shoot him dead, claim self-defense and never be convicted of a crime. Things are different now, right?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West's statements make one wonder</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I note with interest that Allen West claims that he never saw anyone follow him at the mall, never heard clicking locks or saw defensive positioning when he entered an elevator -- all because he was brought up by &quot;awesome&quot; parents. Could it be that we are to take this as a contrast to President Barack Obama's upbringing? Meanwhile, Mr. West did see up to &quot;81&quot; communists in Congress. Different folks evidently see the bogey man in different places.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask charities how money is spent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the letter &quot;Charities' salaries a cause for concern,&quot; we should ask all callers for charitable contributions two questions, which they are required to answer: What percentage of my donation goes to raising the funds and what actually is used for the purpose of the charity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With very few exceptions, you will find out that more than 80 percent goes to raising the funds. One children's charity, when asked that question, said that 88 percent went to raising the funds and 12 percent to the charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I said that's ridiculous, the reply was, &quot;Well, they get the 12 percent.&quot; I am all for charitable giving, but when it becomes a joke, I'm not laughing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check site before making donations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was delighted to read the letter &quot;Charities' salaries a cause for concern.&quot; Too many charities requesting money for their particular cause are paying outrageous salaries to their CEOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Susan B. Komen case is probably a typical example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I receive each request for a donation, I check it out on Charity Navigator, and I do not donate unless they disclose their salaries and/or whatever else is requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also look for a four-star rating, it being the top rating. I no longer feel &quot;guilty&quot; when denying a donation to a so-called charity after receiving gifts of nickels, return address stickers, calendars, notepads, attractive tote bags, jackets, T-shirts, magnets, etc. What will they think of next?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just the other day, I received a donation request from a diabetes association. After checking on Charity Navigator, I discovered 25 other charities with very similar names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This particular charity was not even listed. I cannot help but wonder if this and many of the other so-called charities are scams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some days, I can find five or six envelopes in my mailbox from assorted charities. And don't get me started on the phone calls I constantly receive from charities, usually around dinnertime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suppose the one comforting thought is that they are all proving essential in supporting that beleaguered, yet vital institution: the U.S. Postal Service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Reprehensible,&quot; radio pundit Rush Limbaugh said of President Obama's comments following George Zimmerman's acquittal in the killing of Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;President Obama once again stepped into the role of racial divider in chief,&quot; family-values blogger Rebecca Hagelin wrote for the Washington Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hoped I was wrong about Obama, but in office he has steadily removed any doubt,&quot; said right-wing author David Limbaugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The irony of such criticism of Obama, who tried to convey why some black people feel personally hurt by the Zimmerman verdict, is that many African Americans think his comments came late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president tried to put protesters' angst over the verdict in &quot;context,&quot; a word he used four times Friday. Obama began his remarks by extending prayers to the Martin family and ended by urging everyone to engage in &quot;soul-searching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You know, when Trayvon&nbsp;Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is: Trayvon&nbsp;Martin could have been me 35 years ago,&quot; Obama said. &quot;I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That may be the most important thing the president said. History helps explain the pervasiveness of the nation's racial divide. The gap has grown smaller, but it seems destined to persist so long as people think they can wish it out existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be great if the slate of history could be wiped clean, or if, by edict, life in this country could be declared free and clear of all vestiges of slavery and segregation. But as much as we may want that to be true, it isn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obama said few African American men, including himself, &quot;haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping.&quot; He made the critical link between racial profiling and the fact that &quot;African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obama could have linked crime to poverty and bad schools, which also disproportionately affect African Americans. Little has changed in that regard since W.E.B. DuBois, writing in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The Philadelphia Negro</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 114 years ago, cited poverty and illiteracy as exacerbating crime among black people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, people who never experienced slavery or segregation can feel their impact. That may be hard to believe under a black president. But his achievements only extend so far. Disparities rooted in discrimination provide the context of the outrage over the Zimmerman verdict. Obama stated the truth because he wants the nation to overcome it, not to be further divided.    </SPAN></P>
