</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO FIRED the shot that killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer lies in a series of microscopic scratches on four bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every gun leaves a distinct mark on a bullet, giving investigators a clear path to the cop or cops who fired the fatal round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bullets pierced Bell's neck and hip, perforating his lungs, liver and larynx. He was also shot in the right arm and the right shoulder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the bullets found in Bell have been turned over to NYPD ballistic examiners, according to the medical examiner's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to have to try to determine which bullets came from which guns,&quot; said James Gannalo, retired NYPD officer and ballistics expert. &quot;How easy that will be depends, in part, on the condition of the bullets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Vinegrad, former U.S. attorney from Brooklyn, said it might not make any difference in a prosecution whose bullets hit Bell because &quot;presumably they were all firing with the same intent, the same reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if everybody else stopped firing and the guy who shot 31 shots got off the last shots and it was one of those last shots that killed him,&quot; Vinegrad said, &quot;they may not all be equally responsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gannalo said investigators will first shoot a bullet into water with each of the five guns discharged by officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will give them a clean sample of the markings on the inside of each gun barrel, said Albert Locher, assistant chief deputy district attorney in Sacramento, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locher, who handles ballistics cases, said gun manufacturers use a tool that is pulled through the gun barrel and twisted to cut &quot;grooves and lands.&quot; The lands are the raised areas between two grooves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of rifling causes unique scratches on each gun barrel - making bullets similar to fingerprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the bullet is fired down the barrel of the gun - it's a tight fit - the rifling spins the bullet so it will be more stable in flight and more accurate,&quot; Locher said. &quot;As the bullet travels down the barrel it is pressed against the lands and grooves and the microscopic scratches get reversed on the bullet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identification could be made difficult by damage done to bullets that were fired through glass or steel, or into bone, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops in the shooting were carrying different models of guns, which should make identification easier. While all of the guns were 9-mm. weapons, different manufacturers use different kinds of rifling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tmoore@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graphic: THE DNA OF BULLETS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERY GUN has its own virtual fingerprint that is imprinted on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">every bullet fired. That &quot;fingerprint&quot; is given by a series of indentations inside the gun barrel. The soft lead of the bullet's base gets marked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by these indentations, leaving microsopic scratches behind as the bullet spins through the barrel. These marks are unique to individual gun barrels, but each manufacturer generally has certain characteristics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE POLICE GUNS AT THE SCENE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sig Sauer P-226</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fired by Detective Mike Oliver and Officer Mike Carey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These guns have 6/right rifling characteristics. That means they have six grooves that are angled to the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bullet shot from one of these guns would have the same pattern of angled scratches on its surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith &amp; Wesson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Model 5946</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fired by Detective Paul Headley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This gun, authorized by the NYPD as an alternative to the Glock and also issued by Royal Canadian Mounted Police, has 5/right rifle characteristics, with five grooves angled to the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the Sig Sauer and Smith &amp; Wesson guns are manufactured with traditional rifling, which creates deep grooves in the barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glock 19</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Mark Cooper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glock 26</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unnamed undercover cop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Glock also has 6/right rifling, but its manufacturer uses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a different method, polygonal rifling - where the grooves inside the barrel are less pronounced, making it more difficult to measure and match individual bullets to these guns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD RAIDS AIMED at flushing an &quot;important&quot; witness to the 50-shot police barrage that killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his wedding day ratcheted up tensions yesterday in Queens, where angry residents accused cops of blaming the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dragnet did not find the mysterious &quot;fourth man&quot; who cops believe fled the tragic shooting - although detectives were still questioning at least one person early today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops arrested at least six people, several on gun charges unrelated to the shooting. But police failed to find the gun that cops say they believe the mystery man ran off with when undercover and plainclothes cops opened fire early Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly defended the raids - as sources said at least four witnesses have told investigators they saw a man in a tan jacket standing near Bell's car just before the shooting erupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The existence of a fourth person is important to this investigation,&quot; Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sanford Rubenstein, attorney for the two men wounded in the shooting - Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31 - said, &quot;The concept of a fourth man is a myth, created by whoever for whatever spin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops using information gleaned from the raids zeroed in on Jean Nelson, who some investigators believed could be the fourth man, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson - a 27-year-old known on the street as M.O. - was one of several men who gathered for Bell's bachelor party at the Kalua Cabaret strip club in Jamaica before the fatal police shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops picked up Nelson early yesterday, then kicked him loose without charging him - leading a high-ranking law enforcement source to say he was not the mystery man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But detectives grabbed Nelson again about 8:25 p.m. after he stepped out of his Sutphin Blvd. building and hustled him off in a police car, his dad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cops are hassling everyone in the complex. They're messing with poor people,&quot; said Nelson's dad, who declined to give his name. &quot;They are trying to frame people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four hours earlier, cops raided a Bronx apartment and took away Eric Kellam, 29, his sister said. Cops told the 23-year-old woman the raid was &quot;in connection to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting&quot; and revealed they were looking for a man named Nelson, showing her a photo, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggressive tactics infuriated black residents in Jamaica, who are seething over the fatal police shooting of yet another unarmed black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what they are doing is repulsive, disgusting and deplorable,&quot; said Bishop Erskine Williams Sr., whose son was among those nabbed Wednesday and yesterday during the raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are trying to put together something to cover up an assassination and an execution of this young boy,&quot; said Williams, who has been acting as a spokesman for Benefield and Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops conducted the first raid at 6 a.m. Wednesday at the Baisley Park Houses in Jamaica, taking four people into custody. A loaded 9-mm. handgun and a small amount of marijuana were recovered in an apartment, which sources called a known drug-dealing location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three men in the home were charged with criminal possession of a weapon - the 9-mm. handgun, which police said had no link to Saturday's shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those rousted, LaToya Smith, 26, who was not charged, said cops didn't ask her anything about the gun. She said they questioned her about Bell's pals and told her, &quot;If you don't tell us what we want to hear, you know, you can get five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second raid at Baisley yesterday resulted in the arrest of Williams' son, Erskine Jr., 26, for failing to pay a $25 fine for trespassing last year. His friend Jameek Benston was also taken into custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wanted to know what I was talking to Trent about,&quot; said the younger Williams, who had spent two nights sitting by Benefield's bed at Mary Immaculate Hospital. &quot;They told me I knew who the fourth guy was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams Jr. said that when he denied knowing who the fourth man was, they accused him of selling drugs and asked if he knew local thugs..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, Benefield and Guzman were shot on Liverpool St. after an undercover cop followed them out of the Kalua Cabaret, where a police task force was investigating prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believing Guzman had a gun, the undercover followed the men to Bell's car and fired the opening salvo after Bell, 23, clipped him with the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Hardy, a lawyer who represents Guzman and Benefield, said the wounded men told him unequivocally that there was no fourth man and cops never identified themselves before shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were not aware the person who began shooting at their vehicle was a police officer,&quot; Hardy told New York 1 last night, adding the victims thought they were being &quot;carjacked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardy quoted Guzman as saying Bell turned to him in the front seat and uttered his last words - &quot;I love you, son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover cop and police union officials say the cops fired after Bell hit the undercover and Guzman reached for a gun. No gun has been found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers - two black, two white and one dark-skinned Hispanic - have been placed on paid leave and told to give up their guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles King, a lawyer representing at least three of the men who witnessed the shooting, said they were willing to testify before a grand jury probing the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These witnesses said the undercover never identified himself. Never,&quot; King said. &quot;Police say they are searching for a fourth man? There was no fourth person in the car.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A STABLE OF YOUNG prostitutes worked out of the seedy strip club at the center of the controversial police shooting - posing as barmaids and routinely offering patrons more than a cold drink, law enforcement sources said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The illicit sex trade was so lucrative that the hookers - some as young as 13 - paid bouncers for the right to work at the Kalua Cabaret, then plied men with alcohol before closing the deals, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the underground sex trade - not the threat of gun violence - that led the NYPD's special club enforcement unit to target the club before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed in a fusillade of 50 police bullets early Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had done a lot of work on the Chelsea clubs,&quot; a high-ranking police source said. &quot;We were looking to expand to Queens, and Kalua was at the top of the list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police source said an undercover cop was close to making a prostitution arrest at the club in Jamaica before the explosion of gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prostitution at the club dates back at least two years and includes February's arrest of Troy Siddons, a 20-year-old Bloods gang member who allegedly ran hookers from the club, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siddons trolled halfway houses for vulnerable young girls, telling them he loved them, authorities said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Daddy needs some cash,&quot; Siddons allegedly told them before taking them to Kalua and showing them off to men, often 20 years their senior, a law enforcement source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siddons was arrested outside Kalua and charged with kidnapping and promoting prostitution. If convicted, the ex-con faces up to 25 years to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the same time as Siddons' arrest, the NYPD brought a nuisance abatement case against the club in a bid to shut it down. Police charged that underage patrons had been repeatedly served liquor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, Queens vice cops made two prostitution arrests at the 94th Ave. nightspot, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge had ordered the club closed in July 2005, but it was allowed to reopen two months later after the owners agreed to eliminate small rooms that allegedly had been used for prostitution and to keep hookers from coming inside, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source said most of the prostitutes wore skimpy outfits, while a few walked around topless. The savvier hookers hit up patrons who were drinking heavily, in the belief that they couldn't be undercover cops if they were getting plastered, the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She helps the guy get drunk, and the bartender splits the tips with her,&quot; the source said. &quot;But the big payoff comes in prostitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent months, the prostitutes would leave the club with men and have sex off the premises, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be in a car, down the street or in a flop house,&quot; a source said. &quot;I never heard of it happening inside the club.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club owner, Roger Duran, 33, and his lawyer, Charles Carreras, could not be reached for comment. No criminal charges have been filed against the owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalua opened in 2003 and was initially supposed to be a restaurant, according to its landlord, Juan Escobar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Liquor Authority has been reviewing a series of complaints against the club, including allegations that it hired a convicted felon and allowed someone to bring a weapon inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanctions by the SLA board could include a license revocation, fines up to $10,000 per violation or a suspension of the license. A ruling is expected Dec. 20.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLICE commissioner Raymond Kelly appointed a nine-member task force yesterday to review how the New York Police Department selects, trains, uses and supervises its undercover officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee will not investigate the fatal police shooting of 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Jamaica, Queens, last Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it may make recommendations based on any lessons learned that arise from it,&quot; Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Chief Charles Campisi, head of the department's internal affairs bureau, will head the team. Kelly said the group will be expected to make recommendations quickly, but he did not impose a specific deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly has said it was &quot;unusual&quot; that one of the undercover officers involved in the controversial shooting of Bell and his two friends decided to trail the men and confront them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usually, undercover cops quietly identify suspects and tip off plainclothes officers who make the arrests, allowing the undercover to remain unidentified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and his friends were shot near the Kalua Cabaret strip club in Queens after a 28-year-old undercover cop approached them as they got into Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover cop believed one of Bell's pals had a gun and fired the first of 50 police bullets after Bell clipped the undercover with his car. Bell and his friends were not armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg has said that it appears that the officers &quot;used excessive force&quot; - an opinion backed by Gov. Pataki and Gov.-elect Eliot Spitzer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly has not publicly judged the actions of the cops, who were placed on paid leave and told to give up their guns pending the outcome of a grand jury probe. None of the cops had never fired their guns in the line of duty before the fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 6 a.m. Wednesday, LaToya Smith, 26, was playing in her bed in southeastern Queens with her 7-month-old son Jalyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just then, she heard a strange noise in her family's darkened house. Her locked bedroom door suddenly burst open, and several uniformed cops burst into the room with flashlights and guns drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Smith, the cops ordered her to lie facedown on the floor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My baby, my baby. Where's my baby?&quot; she recalls pleading to them as they hustled her into the living room. There, they gathered her brothers Timothy Smith, 19, and Stanley Smith, 23; her mother, Laura; the baby and Christopher Keys, 18, a friend who was staying in the apartment. Meanwhile, a dozen officers searched the entire place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials said they found a loaded 9-mm. pistol in the apartment and a small bag of marijuana, whereupon they hauled the young woman and the three men to the 103rd Precinct stationhouse. They charged the men with gun possession, but released LaToya Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police also are saying the apartment was a known drug-dealing location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real purpose of the raid was not to find guns or pot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the cops' questions at the stationhouse were about last weekend's police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield outside the Kalua Cabaret, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They kept asking if she knew the whereabouts of certain friends of the three men shooting victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't tell us what we want to hear, you know, you can get five years,&quot; she says one cop told her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, in a bizarre twist almost as inexplicable as the original 50-shot fusillade, the NYPD is raiding homes and picking up young blacks in southeastern Queens in an all-out effort to locate an alleged &quot;fourth man,&quot; a man investigators say was at the scene of the shooting and fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then at 6 a.m. yesterday, cops raided a second apartment in the Smith building and arrested Erskine Willliams Jr. and Jameek Bentson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams was hauled away for an unpaid $25 ticket from last year. But the real reason was his friendship with Benefield, whom he visited several times at the hospital this week. Williams said cops only wanted to know what he talked to Benefield about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erskine Williams Sr., his father, is furious. The father is the unofficial spokesman for the Benefield family. He is also a local minister and the uncle of Smith and her brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a lie,&quot; Williams Sr. said about the police drug allegations against the Smiths. &quot;I live two doors down from there. I know what goes on there. The police will say anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders who learned of the raids in recent days say police would never use such heavy-handed tactics in a white neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can arrest every black person in Queens,&quot; said Michael Hardy, one of the lawyers for the wounded men, &quot;but none of those people were at the party or in the car with my clients.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NYPD is involved in character assassination so they can justify last weekend's shooting in the court of public opinion,&quot; the Rev. Al Sharpton said. &quot;They are trying to make the victims into suspects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is one big difference, Sharpton said, between last weekend's shooting and the infamous killing of Amadou Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Diallo, we only had the testimony of the policemen in the foyer. This time, we have seven or eight people who witnessed this shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was, after all, a bachelor party for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that night. There were several friends of the dead man who left the club when it closed just before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton and lawyers close to Bell's family are now saying some of those witnesses have yet to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of what happened outside the Kalua Cabaret are not yet fully known. But one thing is clear: The NYPD will not encourage any witnesses to come forward by breaking down doors in the black community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the dragnet resulted in the arrests of six people, several on gun charges unrelated to the tragic shooting, cops did not find the mystery man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops also failed to find the handgun that police believe one of Bell's pals reached for when the undercover and plainclothes cops opened fire early Saturday near a seedy strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly defended the raids - as sources said at least four witnesses have told investigators they saw a man in a tan jacket standing near Bell's car just before the shooting started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The existence of a fourth person is important to this investigation,&quot; Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sanford Rubenstein, the attorney for the two men wounded in the shooting - Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31 - said &quot;the concept of a fourth man is a myth, created by whoever for whatever spin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggressive police tactics infuriated black residents in Jamaica, who are seething over the fatal police shooting of yet another unarmed black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think what they are doing is repulsive, disgusting and deplorable,&quot; said Bishop Erskine Williams Sr., whose son was among those nabbed Wednesday and yesterday during police raids at the Baisley Park Houses in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are trying to put together something to cover up an assassination and an execution of this young boy,&quot; said Williams, who has been acting as a spokesman for Benefield and Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narcotics cops conducted the first raid at 6 a.m. Wednesday, taking four people into custody. Three of them were charged with criminal possession of a weapon - a loaded 9-mm. handgun that had no relationship to Saturday's shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those rousted, LaToya Smith, 26, who was not charged, said cops didn't ask her anything about the gun. She said they questioned her about Bell's pals and told her, &quot;If you don't tell us what we want to hear, you know you can get five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second raid early yesterday resulted in the arrests of Williams' son, Erskine Jr., 26, for failing to pay a $25 fine for trespassing last year. Nabbed with him was his friend Jameek Benston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wanted to know what I was talking to Trent about,&quot; said the younger Williams, who had spent two nights sitting by Benefield's bed at Mary Immaculate Hospital. &quot;They told me I knew who the fourth guy was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams Jr. said that when he denied knowing who the fourth person was, they accused him of selling drugs and asked if he knew local thugs known as &quot;Red,&quot; &quot;Duck&quot; and &quot;Bone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops using information gleaned from the raids zeroed in on a Jean Nelson, a 27-year-old man known as &quot;M.O.&quot; When Nelson stepped out of his apartment building about 8:25 p.m. yesterday, detectives hauled him into a police car, Nelson's father said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second time since the fatal shooting that he had been taken into custody, his dad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cops are hassling everyone in the complex. They're messing with poor people,&quot; said the dad, who declined to give his name. &quot;They are trying to frame people. Anybody they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late yesterday cops raided another apartment - this time in the Bronx - and arrested a tall black man, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield and Guzman had taken Bell to the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica for a bachelor bash - unaware that cops investigating drugs and prostitution were staking it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believing Guzman had a gun, an undercover cop followed the men to Bell's car and fired the opening salvo after Bell clipped him with the vehicle. The undercover and four other officers fired 50 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield, who was shot three times, and Guzman, who was hit 11 times, insist cops did not identify themselves before they started firing. But the undercover cop and police union officials contend the cops fired after Bell hit the undercover and a passenger allegedly reached for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman's fianc&eacute;e, Eboni Browning, scoffed at those claims. &quot;If there was a fourth guy, he must be bionic because how could you not get hit with 50 shots,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers - two black, two white and one dark-skinned Hispanic - have been placed on paid leave and told to give up their guns. The shooting is being investigated by the Queens district attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the cops' questions at the stationhouse were about last weekend's police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield outside the Kalua Cabaret, Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They kept asking if she knew the whereabouts of certain friends of the three men shooting victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't tell us what we want to hear, you know, you can get five years,&quot; she says one cop told her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, in a bizarre twist almost as inexplicable as the original 50-shot fusillade, the NYPD is raiding homes and picking up young blacks in southeastern Queens in an all-out effort to locate an alleged &quot;fourth man,&quot; a man investigators say was at the scene of the shooting and fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then at 6 a.m. yesterday, cops raided a second apartment in the Smith building and arrested Erskine Willliams Jr. and Jameek Bentson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams was hauled away for an unpaid $25 ticket from last year. But the real reason was his friendship with Benefield, whom he visited several times at the hospital this week. Williams said cops only wanted to know what he talked to Benefield about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erskine Williams Sr., his father, is furious. The father is the unofficial spokesman for the Benefield family. He is also a local minister and the uncle of Smith and her brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a lie,&quot; Williams Sr. said about the police drug allegations against the Smiths. &quot;I live two doors down from there. I know what goes on there. The police will say anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black leaders who learned of the raids in recent days say police would never use such heavy-handed tactics in a white neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can arrest every black person in Queens,&quot; said Michael Hardy, one of the lawyers for the wounded men, &quot;but none of those people were at the party or in the car with my clients.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NYPD is involved in character assassination so they can justify last weekend's shooting in the court of public opinion,&quot; the Rev. Al Sharpton said. &quot;They are trying to make the victims into suspects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is one big difference, Sharpton said, between last weekend's shooting and the infamous killing of Amadou Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Diallo, we only had the testimony of the policemen in the foyer. This time, we have seven or eight people who witnessed this shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was, after all, a bachelor party for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that night. There were several friends of the dead man who left the club when it closed just before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton and lawyers close to Bell's family are now saying some of those witnesses have yet to come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts of what happened outside the Kalua Cabaret are not yet fully known. But one thing is clear: The NYPD will not encourage any witnesses to come forward by breaking down doors in the black community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I talked to their minister yesterday and decided that I'm not going to go to the funeral,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I've expressed myself and my sympathies on behalf of the city to the family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott, who lives in Bell's neighborhood and is black, will attend the funeral at 7 p.m. at Community Church of Christ in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Lester Williams, the church pastor, confirmed the family asked Bloomberg to stay away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The mayor is doing the right thing and respecting their wishes that this not be turned into a media frenzy,&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg met privately Tuesday at Williams' church with Bell's parents, William and Valerie, and his fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre. Bell and Paultre were supposed to get married the day he was killed and his two friends were wounded by police outside a seedy strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plainclothes and undercover cops fired 50 bullets at the unarmed men after Bell twice rammed his car into an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg has characterized the number of shots fired as &quot;excessive,&quot; which has angered some police advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, black community leaders have bristled at Bloomberg's unwillingness to outright condemn the police involved in the shooting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. 31</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">574 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We always have to look closely at any event involving homicide by cops in the black community. The reasons are simple. First, there is a very long history of racist violence against black people that has just as often been committed by white police as by freelance rednecks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, there has far too often been an assumption of guilt on the part of the police that parallels the old convention of always blaming the bloodshed on the black victim, which would lead to the statement that &quot;he was asking for it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once marches and singing and placard carrying became a knee-jerk convention, what began as a righteous form of protest against injustice was slowly transformed into no more than noisy television spots for demagogues and their gullible followers. Then there is the fact that we always need to see the incident within the context of oppressive violence that has made and continues to make a hell of life in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we look at the example of the recent homicide by police in New York City, we find undercover cops fired 50 rounds of ammunition, killing one black man, wounding two others. None of the men shot was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those defending almost any police action will say that it was a mistake. Yeah, right. Sure thing. Bull dung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the police are far more often the heroes than the villains, it must, at times, be assumed that they are in the wrong. This is one of those times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we hear about the pressures of the job, we should realize that almost anything that happens during an officer's tour has been discussed in detail during training. Beneath every statement and every piece of professional advice, one thought keeps silently booming inside the mind of the teacher and the student: This is the kind of job that can lead to a violent death if one makes a mistake or is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ergo: A little paranoia goes a long way and could make the difference between survival and death in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hear about the pressures of the job and understand that they are enormous. The booming drug trade in the black community, the swelling street gangs (almost all of whom are armed) and the difficulty of telling an honest citizen from a knucklehead with a gun surely make the job demanding and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This difficulty, by the way, is not reserved for white officers. Black officers have the same troubles because hip hop has made acting and looking like a thug an affectation on the parts of too many young black men. None of those things make a killing excusable or something that can be swept away with a frown and a look of tragic recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a tragedy to be recognized, which is that conditions of war are so normal in black communities that we should not be surprised to see an occasional misreading lead to another black death. While all of that may be true, there is little excuse for excessive force to the point of homicide when the suspects were unarmed and had not fired even one shot themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heads should roll because the police, burdened with all of the confusions and various imbecilities that must be faced when upholding the law, manage to do their jobs without killing citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who cannot conduct themselves with the bravery and ease of command that are second nature to the great majority of our police officers, need to find themselves another line of work as soon as they are released from prison for irresponsibly deadly actions. scrouch@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">SEAN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">BELL</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> never gave up his dream of a big league career - not when he had to stop playing to care for his family. Not after several arrests. Not after the daunting task of getting into shape after a four-year layoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The persistence looked like it would pay off for the 23-year-old. According to one of Bell's closest friends, the righthanded pitcher had received an offer to try out for the Dodgers' farm system just two weeks before he was gunned down by police Saturday morning - hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jason Powell, who played first base on the same John Adams high school team that Bell starred for, told the Daily News yesterday that Bell had spent the last year getting himself back into shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He stopped playing on the field, but he still stayed in the gym. He would tell me, 'I've got to get some more mass because I know I'm going to need that for tryouts,' &quot; said Powell, 24. &quot;He didn't want to lose a step.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell said William Bell, Sean's father, had been able to secure the tryout through a friend who had ties to the Dodgers. And even though it had been four years since Bell had pitched competitively - he last played for Nassau Community College in 2002 - Powell said his former teammate had the talent and ability to likely garner attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sean worked so hard because he had such a passion to play,&quot; Powell said. &quot;He could still throw in the high 80s and he was working to get in the low 90s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Minor coached Bell that one season at NCC, when the team made it to the third round of the National Junior College Athletic Association playoffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He most definitely had potential. He was definitely at that time considered as a pro prospect. No question about it. His sophomore year, I think there would have been a very good chance of him being drafted,&quot; said Minor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, however, had to put baseball on hold after one season. His high school sweetheart, Nicole Paultre, was pregnant with the couple's first child, a daughter, and Bell wanted to devote time to family. Minor said that Bell's maturity stood out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I really respected about Sean, he was always a mature, young man at his age,&quot; said Minor. &quot;Most young men would not say, 'I'm going to stop doing what I've been doing since I was a kid.' He realized (baseball) came second to family.&quot; Paultre gave birth to the couple's second daughter earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the four-year layoff, Bell never abandoned his hope. An area scout who remembered Bell's NCC days, however, described him only as an average prospect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Powell, Minor and Bell's high school coach, Glenn Beyer, all thought if anyone had a shot at making it, it was the muscular pitcher who helped the John Adams Spartans win the '99 PSAL title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a hell of a kid,&quot; said Beyer. &quot;Polite, respectful and a tremendous talent. I remember like yesterday the first time he pitched in preseason 1999. He faced 12 batters at George Washington - Manny Ramirez's old school - and struck out eight. I told him afterward, 'Do you realize what you just did?' This whole incident has been a terrible tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THEY PLAYED baseball together for coach Glenn Beyer at John Adams High School in Ozone Park, were on the Adams team that beat Port Richmond at Yankee Stadium in the PSAL championship game in June of 1999. Jason Powell played first and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a kid off the bench that year, and if you had told them that a few years later Bell would be dead from gunshot wounds on the day he was supposed to get married, everybody on the Adams Spartans would have laughed at you, the way they laughed at everything that day from what felt like the top of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is what Jason Powell talked about yesterday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dead at 23. He talked about that and about what a short distance it can be from the ballfield at Adams to the street outside the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens, how the smiling face that Powell will always remember somehow became the face of this kind of racial controversy, and the kind of senseless death the city does not ever forget. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From Adams to that club?&quot; Jason Powell was saying yesterday afternoon. &quot;It's a bus away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell paused and said, &quot;A bus and a short walk,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell and Bell played two seasons together. By the time </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a junior, he was an outfielder at Adams and a pitcher who would be good enough to pitch for Nassau Community College, and still dream about making the pros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then his girlfriend, Nicole, the woman he was supposed to marry on Saturday, became pregnant with their first child and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> life changed. Now he is dead outside a club where he had gone for a bachelor party with some buddies, dead because he was at the wrong place at the wrong time in New York when guns belonging to undercover policemen began going off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was always the one to walk away,&quot; Jason Powell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he was talking about the very best of it for them as kids, talking about that day when they took a bus and finally got on the Deegan to go play a ballgame for the championship of high school ball in their city at Yankee Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we both knew that we might be inside that ballpark again, but we were never ever going to be on that field again,&quot; Jason Powell said. &quot;We used to talk about it all the time, Sean saying, 'We played where Derek Jeter played.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell got the call early Saturday morning, 7 in the morning, that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had died outside Kalua Cabaret a few hours earlier. Then he was calling other Adams ballplayers and getting calls and then somebody finally called Beyer, who is the baseball coach at Adams and the guidance counselor at Fort Hamilton High School, to tell the coach that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had died the morning before he was supposed to marry Nicole Paultre, the girl Jason Powell had introduced him to at Adams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smiling face you see in the newspapers now, the smiling face to go with stories about the 50 rounds fired outside Club Kalua, that is a face Beyer remembers, too. The pitcher who wore No. 33, who loved to pitch inside even when his fastball was topping out at 85 mph, who had so much attitude pitching for the John Adams Spartans that Beyer used to say he reminded him of Bob Gibson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course,&quot; Beyer was saying yesterday, &quot;then I had to explain to the kid who Bob Gibson was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coach was in his office at Fort Hamilton High yesterday, trying to put together a collage to go with the floral arrangement Adams' baseball plans to send to the Community Church of Christ on 108th Ave. in Jamaica, where both a wake and funeral will be held for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tomorrow afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got pictures scattered all over my desk that were never supposed to be used like this,&quot; Beyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He talked about baseball things yesterday the way Jason Powell did, talked about how he would drop off </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after practice sometimes, how after Bell's sophomore season Adams had no home games, because the ballfield at the school was finally being renovated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We played on turf his first season,&quot; Beyer said. &quot;Think of the fastest turf field you ever saw, and then know that the older ours got, it was even faster. Any kid who ever played for me on that field used to hear the same thing: If a guy hit a ball hard enough through the shortstop's legs, it was gonna be a home run, because the ball was gonna roll forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he was remembering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the pitcher, how the way he carried himself on the mound always made you think he had bigger stuff than he really did. Not trying to make him bigger in death than he was in life. Just wanting you to know the kid, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just had this cool attitude about him,&quot; Beyer said. &quot;Ask anybody on our team. That attitude was that the pitcher's mound belonged to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They thought they might win another championship Bell's senior year, then lost in the second round of the playoffs. Even then, Beyer and Bell talked about how they would always have that day at Yankee Stadium, the celebration on the field, then the trip to Aldo's Pizzeria in Ozone Park, where he saw a bunch of high school ballplayers, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> included, turn back into Little Leaguers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I drove him home,&quot; Beyer said. &quot;That was the day I stole a line from Mike Keenan. I told Sean and all the rest of them that we were going to walk together forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Bell is dead because everything went so tragically wrong after his bachelor party and the early morning outside a club the police were watching for drugs and prostitution exploded all around him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I keep everything,&quot; Glenn Beyer said. &quot;This morning I found the index cards I passed out to the kids from the '99 team. They were supposed to tell on one side what was going through their mind about John Adams baseball. On the other side they were supposed to answer the question about where they were going to be in 10 years. We were going to read all the cards at the 10th reunion of the championship game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wrote that he just wanted to be remembered as someone who did his best in everything he tried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was supposed to make it to '09,&quot; his high school coach said yesterday. &quot;They all were.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning team at WRKS (98.7 FM) conducts one of radio's most tangible holiday-help projects tomorrow with its &quot;Kiss Cares Coat Drive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Listeners are asked to bring winter coats - which can be used, as long as they're still wearable - to the Alvin Ailey Dance Studio, W. 55th St. and Ninth Ave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are distributed directly to people who need coats, primarily at homeless shelters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds like such a simple thing that a lot of us probably don't even think about it,&quot; says morning co-host Jeff Foxx. &quot;But there are a lot of people, too many people, who don't have a coat. You have kids going to school without a warm coat, which means they're much more likely to get sick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coat Drive runs 6 a.m.-6 p.m., and the morning team - Foxx, Shaila, Talent, Bob Slade - plan to stay around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can get pretty silly by 3 o'clock,&quot; says Foxx. &quot;But whatever you do is worth it when you see the look on the face of a kid when you give him a coat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the fourth clothing drive, which has gathered up to 13,000 coats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And by the way, Foxx adds, listeners are also invited to bring turtlenecks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Talent wants to do Turtlenecks for Toddlers,&quot; he says. &quot;So that's part of it, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CROSSOVER'S BACK: E. Reese Hopkins, better known as Crossover Negro Reese on the Star &amp; Buc Wild show, is returning to WWPR (105.1 FM) this morning to join the Egypt and Ashy (Donnell Rawlins) morning team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopkins, who will now just be &quot;Crossover&quot; on the air, will be doing news segments and joining the general conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also won't be coming back quietly. &quot;I plan to call people out on the assassination of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; he said, referring to the young man killed by police fire Saturday outside a Queens strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, he says, he wants to spotlight the role of City Council members who did not heed a neighborhood petition asking that the club not be allowed to open there in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's too easy just to blame an entity like 'the police,' &quot; said Crossover. &quot;Police officers are human beings just like all of us, and they make mistakes. We need to look closely at a picture like this, identify who did or didn't do what and make everyone take responsibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossover left Star's show on WWPR 14 months ago. He said he's &quot;delighted that [WWPR program director] Helen Little and [Clear Channel senior vice president] Tom Poleman are giving me an opportunity to come back. I never realized how addictive this is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAD BOY'S BACK, TOO: Michael Baisden, the self-proclaimed &quot;baddest man on radio,&quot; returned yesterday afternoon to WRKS (98.7 FM), saying, &quot;The grown-folks party is back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baisden didn't immediately explain why he was off the air for the last month, calling it a &quot;little hiatus&quot; during which he continued to host live events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His absence sparked a blizzard of rumors, which Baisden derided yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sorry to disappoint all you haters out there,&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm not fired - this party's still going down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WDIA HISTORY: We noted here yesterday the death of John R. Pepper II, who put the country's first all-black format on WDIA in Memphis back in 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The station has compiled a fascinating double-CD set of its history, starting with early airchecks by hosts like Nat D. Williams. It's a great slice of radio, and Rufus Thomas' ad for &quot;Pink Pussy Cat Wine&quot; is worth the price all by itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For info, go to www.am1070wdia.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND THE DIAL: The Writers Guild of America, which represents newswriters at WCBS-AM (880) and WINS (1010 AM) among other places, has overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer from CBS that would have run through August 2010. Guild officials recommended the proposal be rejected, which CBS called &quot;unfortunate.&quot; ... Jamie Lee is returning this weekend to WPLJ (95.5 FM), where she will be hosting the all-request &quot;Saturday Night '80s,&quot; 7-midnight. ...

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD lieutenant who led the police task force that blew away an unarmed bridegroom is a touchy-feely leader who flosses his teeth obsessively - and got bounced from his previous assignment because he put his family before the job, fellow cops told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He actually hugs us,&quot; one officer said of Lt. Gary Napoli. &quot;What boss does that?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Napoli, who ducked for cover when the shooting erupted early Saturday in Queens, is now in the middle of a crisis that could derail his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the investigation into the tragic shooting that left 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dead and two other men wounded gains steam, portraits of Napoli and the other cops involved are emerging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Married with two kids, Napoli, 48, coaches his daughter's Westchester soccer team and is devoted to his elderly parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was that devotion that resulted in Napoli being ousted from his assignment with Manhattan North Narcotics, cops say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Napoli was transferred to the club enforcement unit soon after he took a vacation day to visit his elderly parents on the day he was supposed to attend a mandatory Compstat meeting, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 23-year veteran, who revs himself up by downing a cocktail of Red Bull energy drink and coffee, is known as a quirky commander who calls detectives &quot;Doctor&quot; and &quot;Laddie.&quot; Here is a look at the team he was leading:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Mike Oliver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tall and handsome, the 35-year-old vice cop logged more than 600 arrests during his 12-year career. But he had never shot his gun on the job until he fired 31 times early Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a regular at Chelsea's Bungalow 8 club where he was known as &quot;Undercover Mike,&quot; according to Radar Online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Oliver was three months out of the academy, he and another rookie were assigned to a Manhattan foot post. Hearing shots, they raced to the scene and found two men in a gunfight. The cops arrested the suspects without firing a shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows the control he had even as a rookie, to draw his gun and handle a threat, make the arrests without firing,&quot; Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said. &quot;That's not a cowboy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Mike Carey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carey, who fired three times during the deadly shooting, has been a cop for five years. He is known as a go-getter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Midtown South supervisor called the 26-year-old &quot;Aces&quot; because he accepted any assignment and did his job well. &quot;One of the best rookies I've seen in years,&quot; the boss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carey, who is white, has made 100 arrests. Married to another cop, he recently became a dad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover detective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Daily News is withholding the 28-year-old's name to protect his safety. Brooklyn-born, the cop is Haitian and his mother Mexican. He still lives with his mom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fired the opening salvo early Saturday, shooting 11 times. Since becoming a cop five years ago, he has notched 60 arrests. He also has one citation for meritorious police duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Cooper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Brooklyn narcotics cop with 17 years on the job, Cooper fired four times. He is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Hedley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nine-year veteran, Hedley, 35, fired once. The father of two lives with his police officer wife on Staten Island. He served in Iraq for a year before returning home in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told a neighbor, Noreen Urciuoli, on Monday, &quot;I'm not going to be around for a few days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a really affable guy,&quot; she said. &quot;We definitely like him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unidentified undercover</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">female detective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was with the other undercover in the strip club. She did not fire. She is black.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY MICHAEL DALY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 6</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">726 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all the witnesses are interviewed and all the evidence is analyzed and all the questions are answered as to how the police came to fire 50 shots at three unarmed men, the case will turn on one subjective word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reasonably.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The word features prominently in Section 35 of the New York State Penal Law. Subsection 30 states a cop can use deadly force only to defend himself or another person from &quot;what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state Court of Appeals has ruled that &quot;a determination of reasonableness must be based on the circumstances facing a defendant.&quot; These circumstances include &quot;more than the physical movements of the potential assailant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also to be considered are &quot;any relevant knowledge the defendant had about that person,&quot; such as &quot;Were his buddies overheard talking about a gun?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally important are &quot;any prior experiences he had which could provide a reasonable basis for a belief ... deadly force was necessary.&quot; That could include a cop's experience on the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court says it all comes down to this: &quot;The jury must first determine whether the defendant had the requisite beliefs. Then the jury must also consider whether these beliefs were reasonable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, the grand jury will initially consider whether the cops believed they were in imminent and mortal danger on Liverpool St. in Jamaica, Queens, early Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jurors will then consider the full context, everything the prosecutors present regarding what transpired before and during the shooting. The jurors will also no doubt consider the demeanor and credibility of the officers who choose to testify. Whether or not the cops are indicted could come down to whether they come across as being generally reasonable people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the total circumstances,&quot; a law enforcement official says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the jurors find the cops were reasonable in believing themselves in mortal danger, the number of shots may be an issue. The law states a cop may use physical force &quot;when and to the extent he reasonably believes such to be necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here again arises that word, reasonably, all the more subjective if a cop is found legally justified in firing that first shot. If one shot is not too many, then exactly how many are? Is the cop justified in emptying an entire magazine or even nearly two?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody can rightly describe firing of 50 shots at three unarmed young men as even remotely reasonable. But the question is whether the cops reasonably believed they were in danger. Whether they actually were is not, ultimately, at issue legally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the law seems to lack a precise definition of &quot;reasonable.&quot; The closest the Court of Appeals comes to this is a case holding that cops can stop a person on &quot;reasonable suspicion,&quot; which is described as &quot;the quantum of knowledge sufficient to induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious man under the circumstances to believe criminal activity is at hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, the law seems to define a reasonable belief as: what a reasonable person believes given the particular circumstances. This circular definition is set forth in what legal experts call the touchstone case regarding deadly force in New York, People vs. Bernhard Goetz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It always comes back to Bernie,&quot; a law enforcement official said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Subway Vigilante case hinged on a related subsection of Section 35. Subsection 15 says a person can use deadly force against another person if &quot;he reasonably believes that such other person is using or about to use deadly physical force&quot; or commit a rape or robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, the Court of Appeals ruled &quot;reasonable&quot; did not just mean what the defendant considered reasonable. The whole context had to be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The context in this instance prompted the court to reinstate the attempted-murder indictment against Goetz for shooting four teens he believed were about to rob him on the IRT in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Goetz was acquitted at trial after the jury decided he had been reasonable in believing he was about to be robbed. He was convicted only on a weapon charge, even though he fired on an already prone and wounded teen, saying, &quot;You don't look so bad, here's another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which would suggest that &quot;reasonably&quot; is too subjective a term for anybody to predict how the current case will play out, even after all the big questions are answered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOURS AFTER </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed in a fusillade of 50 police bullets in Queens, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the officers believed Bell and his friends were armed because a cop heard one of them say, &quot;Yo - go get my gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, investigators probing the controversial shooting that plunged the city into crisis have tracked down more than 50 witnesses. Kelly has not publicly judged the officers' actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigators must answer five crucial questions to determine whether the cops broke the law by shooting the three unarmed men early Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 Was the shooting necessary and reasonable?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement sources say this is the most crucial question that prosecutors must answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State law says a cop can use deadly force when it is &quot;necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD officers are taught to not fire upon a moving vehicle unless there is an additional deadly threat - such as someone inside with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Maria Haberfeld, professor of police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the cops who fired could have believed their lives were in danger because Bell twice rammed his car into their unmarked van near a strip club in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can phrase this any way we want. But in my opinion a moving vehicle is a weapon,&quot; said Haberfeld, who specializes in police training and use of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 Did the undercover and plainclothes cops identify themselves as police officers before the shots were fired?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover officer who fired the opening salvo says he pulled the trigger because he believed Bell's pal Joseph Guzman was reaching for a gun in his waistband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective insists he identified himself as a cop by pulling out his shield and screaming &quot;Police!&quot; before any shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Guzman, 31, who was shot 11 times, has told visitors at the hospital that the undercover cop didn't identify himself. Guzman also denied reaching toward his waistband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No witnesses have come forward yet to say they heard the police identify themselves before the shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 Did anyone shout &quot;Gun!&quot; before the shooting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several accounts of the shooting say somebody shouted a warning about a gun moments before the cops began firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a warning was sounded, it's not clear who yelled - one of the cops or Bell and his pals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorenzo Kinred, who was at Bell's bachelor party at the strip club, told the Daily News that Bell and his friends thought the men with guns were street thugs who wanted to attack them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinred said he spoke to Trent Benefield, 23, who was shot three times, before he was put into an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police didn't identify who they were,&quot; Benefield said, according to Kinred, 32. &quot;They just pulled guns out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] saw a guy dressed just like us pulling a gun,&quot; Benefield added, Kinred said. &quot;He just wanted to try and drive away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 Why did Detective Mike Oliver fire 31 of the 50 shots, even pausing to reload?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, who had never fired a gun in the line of duty before early Saturday, emptied his semiautomatic handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources say he apparently thought the gun would no longer fire because it was jammed. So he put another clip into the gun and resumed firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Kenneth Thompson, who prosecuted the cops who beat and sodomized Abner Louima in 1997, said the number of bullets fired by cops early Saturday raises questions about whether the shooting was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question is, 'Why did they keep firing at him?'&quot; he said. &quot;I don't understand that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 Was there a fourth man who ran away from the car? If so, did he have a gun?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources say investigators last night identified a fourth man who had been seen with Bell, near the groom's car, just before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mystery man's picture was picked out of two separate photo lineups. Cops want to talk to the man, who they believe may have fled with a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No weapon has been found, but cops continue to search the crime scene.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN AS a probe widens of a fatal shooting by cops in Queens, the details hardly matter to some New Yorkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To them, the story always ends the same: An unarmed black man dies at hands of cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course it angers me as a black man because it was uncalled for,&quot; said Khalef Balo, 40, of Hillside, Queens. &quot;Police have a suspicion that the black man is always dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence of dissent is plentiful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near the strip club where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot dead early Saturday after his bachelor party, two signs were taped to a brick wall: &quot;Death to Police Brutality and Murder&quot; and &quot;Off the Pigs Who Shoot Our Kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Jamaica Colosseum Mall, clerk Alpha Eah, 33, said customers have been seething.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're talking about it a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;People are mad about it. They're saying it's too much - 50 shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiana Richardson, 15, said some people in her high school &quot;have it out bad for the cops&quot; because of the shooting. &quot;They treated him like garbage,&quot; Tiana said of Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the overwhelmingly black community of Jamaica, men and women said the shooting has dominated conversations in malls, beauty salons, churches and other public places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this point, I think the people do need to take to the streets,&quot; said Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. &quot;It is clear that the message of being tempered and hoping that things will change is not getting across to the people who need to understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, had a more muted message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They visited the scene yesterday where Bell lost his life, accompanying Bell's fianc&eacute;e and his parents. They passed by a growing memorial of flowers, photos and dozens of candles lit in remembrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appeal to people: Don't do anything disruptive or any way contrary to the memory of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Sharpton said at a news conference, standing next to Bell's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police statistics show that the number of NYPD shootings in the city plunged from 253 in 1997 to 112 in 2006 with the number of rounds fired decreasing from 1,040 to 429.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has been slower to change is the racial makeup of the NYPD. Of the approximately 35,689 uniformed officers, 16.3% are black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the street, the perception remains that the shooting has racial overtones because the victims were black and the shooter who fired the bulk of the bullets was white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a symbol, not an aberration. Our criminal justice system is broken down on black America, on young black males,&quot; Jackson said, calling on the FBI to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said that the groom was involved in an argument after 4 a.m. and that one of his friends made a reference to a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover detective followed the men, police said, and began firing because he thought Guzman was reaching into his waistband for a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the detective fired, the others joined in. The 12-year veteran who fired his weapon 31 times, one of two white cops in the group, paused to reload.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of Bell's friends, Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23, remain hospitalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to marry Bell and his fianc&eacute;e, said &quot;the community wants justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't want the city to erupt in violence, you want peace,&quot; he said, &quot;but you've got to make changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIS FACE covered by an oxygen mask, his bullet-ridden body confined to a hospital bed, a survivor of the 50-shot police barrage that felled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his wedding day claimed yesterday that the cops &quot;tried to kill me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasping as he made his first public statement since the shooting, Joseph Guzman demanded justice for his slain pal as relatives and well-wishers streamed through his room. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They killed Sean,&quot; he said. &quot;Y'all gotta do something. We didn't have nothing, we didn't have nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman's message was conveyed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, who along with the Rev. Jesse Jackson visited Guzman and the other wounded man, Trent Benefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit came as police sources revealed last night that they have identified a long-sought fourth man who walked to Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two witnesses picked the man out of two separate photo lineups. He is not under arrest but is being sought. Police believe the mystery man - who had been with Bell and his pals inside the Queens strip bar before the shooting - may have run off with a weapon. So far, no gun has been recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And detectives have not yet questioned Guzman. When several tried to get into his room on Monday, his sister Yolanda Guzman chased them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saturday he was unconscious, handcuffed,&quot; Sharpton said outside Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens. &quot;Yesterday he was groggy. Today for the first time he spoke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sharpton said Guzman, 31, was &quot;very clear&quot; about what he was saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even at one point, when we pulled back from the bed after having prayed, he called us back and said, 'They tried to kill us, they tried to kill us,' &quot; Sharpton said. &quot;Obviously he is just coming into his own consciousness and pleading for help. We promised him we would do what has to be done to get justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling Guzman a &quot;victim witness,&quot; Jackson said the NYPD needs to act with one eye on its history of brutal, sometimes deadly attacks on unarmed blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whether it's an Abner Louima, [Amadou] Diallo, or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> those who are held to a higher standard must pay a higher price when they, in fact, break the law they are paid to uphold,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman also knows something about breaking the law. His record includes nine arrests for drug offenses. But he had not been collared since a felony drug charge in 2002. He pleaded guilty in that case and recently completed parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the five cops who fired on the trio broke any laws is the subject of an ongoing probe by police and the Queens district attorney's office that is being monitored by the Justice Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors are awaiting a toxicology report on Bell to see if he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the shooting. They also are wading through 911 tapes and police radio transmissions - as well as crime-scene evidence and the officers' personnel records - as they prepare their case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers - two black, two white and one dark-skinned Hispanic - have been placed on paid leave and told to give up their guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg said earlier it appeared the officers used &quot;excessive force&quot; and yesterday both the outgoing - and incoming - governors agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Pataki called what happened to Bell &quot;one of those tragedies that breaks your heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously 50 bullets fired into, or at, an unarmed individual in New York is excessive force,&quot; he said from Kuwait. &quot;But the appropriate response to that is something I think the investigation of the mayor and the police commissioner will reveal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This terrible tragedy deserves to be fully investigated,&quot; Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer said to El Diario La Prensa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman was hit 11 times and relatives said he remains in critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's extremely hard on the body when you have 19 holes,&quot; Guzman's pregnant fianc&eacute;e, Eboni Browning, said as she held their 6-year-old son, Juwan. &quot;Things we value and take for granted, he can't do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield, 23, was hit three times and underwent surgery yesterday to remove two bullets from his body. &quot;He looked nervous before going under the knife,&quot; said his lawyer, Kareem Vessup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still wearing her engagement ring, Nicole Paultre, Bell's fianc&eacute;e, also visited her beloved's wounded buddies but left without comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman and Benefield had taken Bell to the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens, for a bachelor bash - unaware that undercover cops probing prostitution and drugs were there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before they left at 4 a.m., Bell had an angry exchange with another patron. And one of the undercovers who had been inside the club followed them to Bell's car because he heard Guzman say he was going to get a gun, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Karasyk, who represents the Brooklyn-born undercover detective who fired the first shot, said his client identified himself and held his fire even after Bell clipped him with his Nissan Altima. But when the man sitting in the passenger seat - whom police sources identified as Guzman - reached into his waistband, the officer fired the first of 11 rounds at the men, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the other cops, who had never fired their guns on the job before, joined in. Detective Mike Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, even reloaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveying the crime scene, Guzman's sister said the cops' story just doesn't add up. &quot;A dog doesn't deserve to die like that,&quot; Yolanda Guzman said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators believe two mysterious men, one of whom may have had a gun, could hold the key to learning why police unleashed a 50-bullet barrage that killed a groom leaving his bachelor party at a strip club hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man was last seen dressed in black, standing in front of a sport utility vehicle with silver rims and exchanging glares and insults with the groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another man was last seen wearing a beige jacket and running away from Bell's car as five officers fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officials provided partial descriptions Wednesday of the two missing witnesses and details about their possible roles based on accounts from undercover officers and at least one civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an undercover officer, the man in black argued with Bell and his companions as they exited a Queen strip club where Bell was having a bachelor party. The officer was part of a vice team investigating complaints about prostitution and drug dealing at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, while in front of a black SUV parked outside the club, reached into his pocket as if he had a weapon as Bell challenged him to a fight and one of Bell's companions, Joseph Guzman, said, &quot;Yo, get my gun. Get my gun,&quot; according to the officials, citing the undercover detective's account. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation has not been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials said the exchange prompted a second undercover detective to follow Bell and three other men as they walked away toward their car, apparently suspecting the men meant to arm themselves and attack the man in black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, the second undercover started shooting at the car when Bell, while trying to drive away, bumped him and smashed into an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the victims, Trent Benefield, told police Bell became spooked and tried to take off because he didn't know the undercover cop was a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has ignited outrage in New York, and civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton visited the scene of the shooting yesterday to console the victims' relatives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE PLAINCLOTHES cop who fired most of the 50 shots that killed a Queens bridegroom on his wedding day stood a short distance from the crime scene, a stunned look on his face. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These pictures - taken about an hour after the deadly shooting - dramatically illustrate the early moments of a tragedy that has plunged the city into crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was still dark outside as NYPD Detective Mike Oliver and four colleagues milled about the crime scene, where 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed and two others were wounded in a 50-shot fusillade Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As forensic investigators marked the shell casings and made note of where Bell's car collided with the police van, Oliver and other NYPD cops - some of them wearing their badges around their necks, but none wearing uniforms - watched uneasily, their hands thrust deep inside their pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another picture, Oliver is wearing a hood against the damp cold. In the foreground stands another cop in plainclothes. He is looking down on the discarded jacket of Bell's pal Trent Benefield, who along with Joseph Guzman, was badly wounded by the gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In various pictures, the group of cops shifts a few feet, from grass to sidewalk, sidewalk to against a chain-link fence. But their grim expressions never change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, when they are allowed to leave the scene, they walk past the glare of camera lights, most holding their heads up, and only one shielding his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days later, the killing ground on Liverpool St. is still filled with investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than anything, they are looking for the gun that Oliver and the undercovers staking out the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica thought the victims were packing - a gun that may have been a deadly rumor. None of the victims was believed to have been armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing yet,&quot; a city cop said yesterday as he and 25 other specialists expanded the search area some 50 yards from the crime scene to the barren ground beneath the elevated AirTrain tracks at 94th Ave. and Liverpool St.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joined by Port Authority and MTA officers, they used specially trained dogs to search vents, trash cans and Dumpsters. While they worked, other specialists traced the path of each of the bullets in order to figure out who fired the fatal shot. csiemaszko@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD officers were told of the two threats during roll calls across the five boroughs as investigators in the city and in Essex County, N.J., were trying to confirm the origin and validity of the threats. Neither threat mentioned specific targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;message was read at roll calls to remind members of the service to exercise caution, remain alert and to wear their protective vests,&quot; Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vague threat against city cops, Browne said, was in response to the shooting early Saturday that left </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dead minutes after leaving a seedy Queens strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essex County authorities said a separate threat was phoned to prosecutors. The caller claimed an unusual pact had been made between local groups of Bloods and Crips.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UNDERCOVER cop who fired the opening salvo in a 50-shot barrage that felled a Queens man on his wedding day told his story yesterday for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective insisted he identified himself as a cop well before he fired on the car carrying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his buddies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cop screamed, 'Police!' and he had his shield out,&quot; attorney Philip Karasyk told the Daily News. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The News is withholding the name of the Brooklyn-born detective to protect his safety and the undercover operations he has worked on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective held his fire despite Bell clipping him with his Nissan Altima, said Karasyk, who refused to name his client, even as police sources confirmed his identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once the car hit him, he jumped to the side,&quot; Karasyk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the cop saw the man sitting in the passenger seat - whom police sources identified as Joseph Guzman - reach into his waistband, the officer fired the first of 11 rounds at the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four other officers, believing they were being shot at, also opened up on the car, Karasyk said. When the gunfire was over, Bell was dead and Guzman and another man, Trent Benefield, were badly wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other officers believed the shots were coming from the vehicle,&quot; Karasyk said. &quot;They only did so in this case because they were in mortal fear for their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown has vowed to get to the bottom of the Saturday morning shooting that has outraged black New Yorkers - and that Mayor Bloomberg said looked like &quot;excessive force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karasyk, however, said the five cops involved in the shooting - none of whom ever fired his gun on the job before - had no qualms about telling their stories before a Queens grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's our offer to the prosecutors - to waive immunity,&quot; Karasyk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer's client is a Hispanic officer in his late 20s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 66-year-old relative told The News that the detective is a good cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only God knows what happened,&quot; he said. &quot;Police never shoot for no reason. Maybe he's got a reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department is monitoring the unfolding investigation, but Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Roslyn Mauskopf emphasized it is not independently collecting evidence or interviewing witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an NAACP meeting in Queens last night, black leaders called for the feds to appoint a special prosecutor if Brown doesn't obtain an indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said police were questioning a new witness. Sources said that witness was China Flores, who had told The News that a fourth man nearly jumped in Bell's car before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are still searching for that fourth man, who is believed to have left the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens, with the victims - and to have disappeared shortly before the shooting started. Police also believe that the mystery man may have been armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All five officers have been placed on paid leave and ordered to surrender their guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life-long friends Guzman and Benefield took Bell out for a bachelor bash at the club - unaware that cops investigating drugs and prostitution were staking out the joint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two undercover detectives - Karasyk's client and a female officer - were inside. NYPD guidelines permitted them to have two drinks; Kelly said it wasn't yet known whether Karasyk's client was drinking because he hasn't been questioned pending the grand jury probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bell and his pals left at 4 a.m., Karasyk's client followed. Kelly conceded on Monday that it was unusual for an undercover officer to pursue suspects; normally, the undercover signals his colleagues to move in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karasyk said his client followed because he heard Guzman say outside the club that he was going to get a gun to settle a beef with another club patron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the African-American community believe there was a racial component to the shooting because Bell and Benefield are both black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Mike Oliver, who fired 31 shots, and Officer Mike Carey, who fired three times, are both white - as is Lt. Gerard Napoli, the supervising officer who did not fire his weapon. The two other officers who fired the remaining shots are both black. Their names have not been revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have a mountain of evidence to go through, and there also are more than 50 people to interview, delaying the empaneling of the grand jury. If charges are brought, all the cops' names will come out.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN IF THEY VIOLATED NYPD guidelines, the cops under investigation for shooting three unarmed men may not have broken the law, experts said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though a Queens grand jury is expected to consider a range of charges beginning with second-degree murder, the cops are more likely to be found guilty of department infractions - while the city foots the bill for the costly wrongful-death and negligence suits that are sure to come. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The history is that it is extraordinarily hard to criminally prosecute officers who were on duty,&quot; said Eugene O'Donnell, professor of police science at CUNY's John Jay College of Criminal Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops have faced criminal trials, such as those involved in the high-profile deaths of Anthony Baez and Amadou Diallo, with mixed results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In most of these cases, justice comes to the families in the form of [civil] lawsuit damages,&quot; said O'Donnell, a former Bronx cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mayor Bloomberg called the amount of firepower used &quot;unacceptable or inexplicable,&quot; it might not rise to the level of a crime, Jim Cohen, a professor of criminal law at Fordham Law School, told The Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of shots fired doesn't mean anything, even though it seems a little shocking,&quot; Cohen added. &quot;We simply don't have enough information to draw any conclusions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another John Jay professor, Jeanne Thelwell, said the apparent failure to follow NYPD guidelines could clear the way for a successful civil suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Simply the fact that they did not stop after three shots might be enough for a civil judgment,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the deadly encounter in Jamaica early Saturday, attorneys were in abundance to represent families and survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slain groom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parents and the family of wounded victim Joseph Guzman retained noted negligence lawyer Sanford Rubenstein and Michael Hardy, both long associated with the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubenstein previously represented Abner Louima, who was beaten and sodomized by cops in 1997, in a successful civil suit against the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this stage we're not looking at the lawsuit aspect at all,&quot; insisted Manhattan lawyer Kareem Vessup, whose firm was retained Monday night to represent the family of victim Trent Benefield, who is also hospitalized with gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to O'Donnell, the Police Department could charge the five officers with misconduct, and penalties would range from termination to retraining.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NYPD task force at the center of Saturday's controversial police shooting has investigated 222 clubs and arrested 156 people - but has closed only two clubs, police records show. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD club enforcement unit was created in August a month after the murder of Jennifer Moore, an 18-year-old New Jersey teen who was abducted, raped and killed after partying in Chelsea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police unit was designed to fight underage drinking, prostitution and gun violence. It initially focused on Chelsea's nightlife before moving to Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had established a good record in addressing conditions in Chelsea, and had begun to do the same at problem locations in Queens,&quot; Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit has closed the Spirit club in Chelsea and the Secrets club in Jamaica. It has made 60 felony and 96 misdemeanor arrests and has issued 42 criminal summonses, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task force has been fighting to close several clubs, including Kalua Cabaret, the strip joint in Queens where 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his pals were partying Saturday before Bell was killed nearby by police bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators say the club has been a haven for drugs and prostitution. Police raided the club in March and cops arrested three people on drugs and weapons charges. The city also found numerous code violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens prosecutors say the State Liquor Authority took more than a month to respond to a request for help during an investigation of the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SLA, in turn, blames Queens prosecutors for the delays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of yesterday, an SLA administrative law judge had yet to act on a mid-October request to revoke the club's license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the club has yet to pay $2,700 fines imposed by the city Buildings Department in March.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEARLY THREE YEARS ago, in another police killing of an unarmed black man that outraged our city, Police Officer Richard Neri fatally shot Timothy Stansbury on a roof stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stansbury, 19, had committed no crime. Like Bell, he was simply partying late one night with two boyhood friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stansbury and his buddies tried to reach a party in an adjacent building by taking a shortcut across their roof when they suddenly came face to face at the roof door with Neri and his partner. The two cops were on a vertical patrol with their guns drawn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A startled Neri discharged a single shot that killed Stansbury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then, in January 2004, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly immediately called the shooting unjustifiable. For his honesty, the police union accused him of a rush to judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that was just one shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not the 50-shot fusillade unleashed by five cops this weekend at Bell and his friends; not even the 31 rounds fired by one of the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, it was Mayor Bloomberg, not Kelly, who publicly questioned the actions of the cops. The commissioner, who says he's still investigating the facts in this latest incident, has clearly distanced himself from Bloomberg's more critical remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the aftermath of Stansbury's death, many black leaders say, is proof that sympathetic words mean nothing without concrete action from City Hall and Police Headquarters to improve police procedures, action that changes the culture of the Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone agrees there has been improvement in police-community relations since the racial-profiling days of Rudy Giuliani and former Commissioner Howard Safir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But incidents like the Stansbury and Bell killings show some things haven't changed that much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early 2004, a Brooklyn grand jury quickly concluded that Neri's actions, while tragic, did not warrant criminal charges. The jurors were reportedly swayed by Neri's deep remorse. He broke down in tears on the stand and claimed he couldn't recall what happened when he fired his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD subsequently filed disciplinary charges against him. Now a Patrolmen's Benevolent Association delegate, Neri remains on modified assignment. Last May, he was quietly convicted in a departmental trial of failing to secure his weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial judge in the case recommended punishment of 30 days' lost vacation and a year's probation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, you read that right: 30 lost vacation days for a failure that caused the killing of an innocent man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly, who jumped to label the Stansbury shooting unjustifiable when it was big news, has now taken more than five months to decide what to do with Neri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police commissioners are not required to follow a trial judge's recommendation in determining discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has asked for more information on the verdict before he makes a decision,&quot; Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stansbury was an example of photo ops for the commissioner and mayor and then nothing got done,&quot; Marq Claxton, a retired detective and spokesman for 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement, said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a deposition in a civil suit by the Stansbury family this year - one the city has so far refused to settle - a lawyer asked Neri what caused him to fire his gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a reflexive action. There was no conscious decision of mine to pull,&quot; Neri said, according to a copy of the transcript obtained by the Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; the lawyer asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was more of a startling action like a flinch, like if someone got scared, you flinch. You make a fist,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the deposition, Neri was asked why he referred to Stansbury in his official report of the shooting as a &quot;perp,&quot; short for perpetrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's how we, being the Police Department, it's a slang term how it's referred to in this case,&quot; the cop said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neri's lawyer, Mitch Garber, did not respond to a request for comment about the case yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city still has not &quot;changed the culture of the Police Department,&quot; Queens City Councilman James Sanders said yesterday during a press conference with Bloomberg and Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stansbury was no &quot;perp.&quot; Neither was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were citizens of this city mistakenly killed by police officers sworn to protect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only actions, not words, will reduce such tragedies in the future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE UNDERCOVER cop who fired the opening salvo in a 50-shot barrage that felled a Queens man on his wedding day told his story yesterday for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective insisted he identified himself as a cop long before he fired on the car carrying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his buddies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cop screamed, &quot;Police!&quot; and he had his shield out,&quot; attorney Philip Karasyk told the Daily News. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The News is withholding the name of the Brooklyn-born detective to not compromise his safety or the undercover operations he has worked on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective held his fire despite Bell clipping him with his Nissan Altima, said Karasyk, who refused to name his client, even as police sources confirmed his identity. &quot;Once the car hit him he jumped to the side,&quot; Karasyk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the cop saw the man sitting in the passenger seat - whom police sources identified as Joseph Guzman - reach into his waistband, the officer fired the first of 11 rounds at the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four other officers, believing they were being shot at, also opened up on the car, Karasyk said. When the gunfire was over, Bell was dead and Guzman and another man, Trent Benefield, were badly wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other officers believed the shots were coming from the vehicle,&quot; Karasyk said. &quot;They only did so in this case because they were in mortal fear for their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown has vowed to get to the bottom of the Saturday morning shooting that has outraged black New Yorkers - and that Mayor Bloomberg said looked like &quot;excessive force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karasyk, however, said the five cops involved in the shooting - none of whom ever fired his gun on the job before - had no qualms about telling their story before a Queens grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's our offer to the prosecutors - to waive immunity,&quot; Karasyk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer's client is a Hispanic officer in his late 20s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 66-year-old relative told The News that the detective is a good cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only God knows what happened,&quot; he said. &quot;Police never shoot for no reason. Maybe he's got a reason?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Justice Department is monitoring the unfolding investigation, but Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Roslyn Mauskopf emphasized it is not independently collecting evidence or interviewing witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said police were questioning a new witness. Sources said that witness was China Flores, who had told The News that a fourth man nearly jumped in Bell's car before the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are still searching for that fourth man, who is believed to have left the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens, with the victims - and to have disappeared shortly before the shooting started. Police also believe that the mystery man may have been armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All five officers have been placed on paid leave and ordered to surrender their guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life-long friends, Guzman and Benefield took Bell out for a bachelor bash at the club - unaware that cops investigating drugs and prostitution were staking out the joint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two undercover detectives - Karasyk's client and a female officer - were inside. NYPD guidelines permitted them to have two drinks; Kelly said it wasn't yet known whether Karasyk's client was drinking because he hasn't been questioned pending the grand jury probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bell and his pals left at 4 a.m., Karasyk's client followed. Kelly conceded on Monday that it was unusual for an officer to pursue suspects; normally, the undercover signals his colleagues to move in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karasyk said his client followed because he heard Guzman say outside the club that he was going to get a gun to settle a beef with another club patron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in the African-American community believe there was a racial component to the shooting because Bell and Benefield are both black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Mike Oliver, who fired 31 shots, and Officer Mike Carey, who fired three times, are both white - as is Lt. Gerard Napoli, the supervising officer who did not fire his weapon. The two other officers who fired the remaining shots are both black. Their names have not been revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators have a mountain of evidence to go through, including video from one or more surveillance cameras near the scene of the shooting, radio transmissions among cops and ballistic reports for the 50 shots fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There also are more than 50 people to interview, delaying the empaneling of the grand jury. If charges are brought, all the cops' names will come out - and the NYPD's image will be tarnished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want answers, we want answers,&quot; William Bell, whose son Sean was shot dead by cops, told Bloomberg repeatedly as his son's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre, wept quietly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting with them in the front pews of Community Church of Christ in Jamaica, Queens, Bloomberg vowed, &quot;there would be a full investigation, but he made them no promises,&quot; a witness to the exchange told the Daily News. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The family told the mayor they didn't understand how this could happen,&quot; the source said. &quot;They don't want the city disrupted, they're not calling for anyone's resignation, they just want justice done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They first talked with Bloomberg flanked by African-American leaders and clergy, such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, Bishop Lester Williams, who was to marry Paultre and Bell, and state Senate Minority Leader Malcolm Smith (D-Queens).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the officials retreated to the back of the church to give the family and Bloomberg some time alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the one-hour meeting was over, Paultre left with relatives for the J. Foster Phillips Funeral Home on Linden Blvd. in St. Albans. She carried with her clothes for her fianc&eacute;, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the unarmed 23-year-old who was slain Saturday just hours before their wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After dropping off the clothes, Paultre and two friends drove to Jamaica Ave., where they marched sadly from store to store in search of something to wear to Bell's funeral on Friday. They gave up as darkness descended and headed home without having made a purchase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With many leaders in the black community seething over the fatal police shooting of yet another unarmed black New Yorker, Bloomberg reached out to Sharpton shortly after Bell was killed outside a seedy strip club, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg's meeting with Bell's kin came a day after he held two emotional meetings with black leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We talked a lot about the procedures of who investigates what,&quot; Bloomberg said yesterday. &quot;They obviously, like many people, would like to speculate on what happened. And I pointed out that I can't get involved in speculation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day earlier, Bloomberg said the 50 shots &quot;sounds like excessive force.&quot; He did not back away from his comments yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a civilian. I am not a professional law enforcement officer,&quot; he said. &quot;I used the word excessive and that's fine. That was my personal opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Bell declined to detail what he told Bloomberg during the private meeting. &quot;That's something personal,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm keeping that between me and him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Bell, holding his slain son's 5-month-old daughter in his arms, later told WABC Channel 7, &quot;Even now I don't believe it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm afraid to go to sleep,&quot; he said. &quot;They just killed my son. For what reason? It doesn't matter to me what color the cops was. My son is dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had just left the Kalua Cabaret strip club with his pals, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, when they got into a fatal confrontation with cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman, 31, was shot 11 times and remained in critical condition. Benefield, 23, who was hit three times, was in stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Councilman Thomas White, who represents the Jamaica area, visited with relatives of the injured men at Mary Immaculate Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives tried to interview Guzman's sister, Yolanda, on Monday. But she wouldn't let them into her brother's room, a family spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She believes the officers tried to kill all of them and she's afraid someone is going to come and finish the job,&quot; said family spokesman Charles Aziz Bilal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black radio hosts, like their colleagues, figured to spend yesterday morning bantering about eating too much turkey and heading back to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the story of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the bridegroom who died Saturday in a hail of police bullets in Queens, changed that plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We started with the light stuff,&quot; said Jeff Foxx, co-host of the &quot;Wake-Up Club&quot; on WRKS (98.7 FM). &quot;But we realized very quickly that wasn't what the listeners wanted yesterday. They wanted to talk about this case. So that's where we took it. You go in with a game plan. But you end up making a lot of calls at the line.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that any station planned to ignore the case. &quot;It was on my mind from the time I heard about it,&quot; said Egypt, co-host with Donnell Rawlins on WWPR (105.1 FM). &quot;I knew we'd talk about it, which is why I reached out to family members and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fianc&eacute;e.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bell case also became the dominant topic at WQHT (97.1 FM) with DJ Envy, Michael Shaun and Research. Ann Tripp made it the lead news story with Steve Harvey on WBLS (107.5 FM), and it was prominent on Deepa Fernandez's &quot;Wake-Up Call&quot; over WBAI (99.5 FM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added up to an often intense post-holiday morning on the radio. &quot;But that's what radio can do,&quot; said Egypt. &quot;It can give you something light and fun, then shift to something serious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making extra time for the Bell story, said Foxx, served the listeners: &quot;We could go into more details and aspects of the case, not just give it a sound bite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Egypt's interview with Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre, WRKS, WQHT and WWPR talked with activists like the Rev. Al Sharpton and Councilman Charles Barron, as well as police officers, who had a wide range of perspectives - from defending the shooters to saying it sounded like procedures were violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And lots of regular folks just wanted to talk,&quot; said Foxx. &quot;Local radio can let them do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bell case was also the focus of Sunday's local black talk shows, like Imhotep Gary Byrd on WBLS and Bob Slade/ James Mtume/Bob Pickett on WRKS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several callers lamented the city's lack of a full-time black talk station that could help keep ongoing issues like police conduct in the spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This story isn't going away,&quot; said Egypt. &quot;But at least today listeners were able to vent, I was able to vent and we could offer a little comfort to Nicole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WLIB HOSTS: WLIB (1190 AM), which launched its new &quot;Praise and Inspiration&quot; format without hosts in September, is now putting a lineup in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denise Hill, &quot;The Gospel Lady in the Morning&quot; and program director, does 6-10 a.m., and the Rev. Hezekiah Walker plays &quot;Afternoon Praise,&quot; 2-7 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syndicated hosts Morgan Dukes and Jackie Campbell are heard in middays and drive time, with local elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CELEBRATING RUTH: Robert Putignano salutes the late Ruth Brown tomorrow at 10 a.m. on WFDU (89.1 FM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown, a pioneer of R&amp;B who later became a multimedia star, died last weekend at 78. Putignano's show will include an interview with Brown and Joel Dorn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other important early black music figures also passed away recently: Art Jackson of Kansas City's Five Scamps, who went to school with Charlie Parker, and bluesman Robert Lockwood Jr., who played with the famous Robert Johnson.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 6</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone seems to agree somebody shouted a warning about a gun moments before the cops fired 50 shots at a trio of unarmed young men in a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is who shouted. A civilian witness named China Flores - who admits to a long history with the law - insists it was one of the three young men who called out, &quot;He's got a gat! He's got a gat!&quot; to his friends. The young man, Trent Benefield, had seen a tall figure approach, holding something black at his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tall figure was an undercover cop, and a published account citing police sources maintains that he was the one who shouted, &quot;He's got a gun! He's got a gun!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the young men did not have a gun. The figure who approached them did. And Benefield would later say he and his two friends had no idea the man was an undercover police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Benefield was indeed the one who shouted, there remains the possibility that the other cops thought the warning had come from the undercover approaching the car. The cops would not have expected the three young men in the car to be the ones to call out that somebody had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, the cops had tailed the three young men from the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens, suspecting they had a gun. The cops may well have mistaken the sudden shout about a gun to be confirmation from their comrade that the suspects were indeed armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, by Flores' account, the shouted warning prompted the driver of the young men's car to speed away from the curb and repeatedly crash into an undercover vehicle in an attempt to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further possibility here arises, a twist of tragic irony: Perhaps the same warning that caused the young men to flee also caused the cops to fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives union insists the undercover cop was wearing his shield around his neck and ordered the occupants of the vehicle to display their hands before the first shot was fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flores says the undercover produced his shield only after the last shot was fired. Flores maintains that six to 10 shots had been fired before the undercover shouted, &quot;Police! Put your hands out!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth might be much easier to establish had the cops employed the &quot;Kel&quot; transmitter they had been provided so they could record their undercover interactions. The lieutenant chose to leave the admittedly troublesome device at the office and communicate instead via cell phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is certain is that all 50 shots were fired by the police. One struck a first-floor window of a frame house, punching a neat hole in the glass that was covered by a sheet of white paper yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three more bullets had struck a blue Mitsubishi Galant that was still parked at the curb. One of these three had torn a hole by the driver's side door. A second had struck the right rear wheel, chipping the hubcap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third had struck the rear-wing window and pierced the driver's headrest, deflecting slightly off one of the metal supports. The slug then hit the bottom of the windshield with enough force to crack it, but not break through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police investigator must have retrieved the spent bullet from the dashboard, on which lay fragments of foam from inside the headrest. Bullets sometimes cause fragments of tissue and bone to burst from a wound in just this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the center of the street glinted bits of glass and shards of chrome from when the young men's Altima collided repeatedly with the police vehicle. More broken glass lay by the dented rolldown gate the Altima struck when it backed up in an effort to get away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beside the gate somebody had placed a dozen white candles and a computer printout of a photograph that showed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with his fianc&eacute;e and their 3-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such shrines to the fallen innocent are all too common at shooting scenes. They are usually cause to give thanks for the police officers who routinely place themselves in the gravest danger to take loaded guns off the street. Our cops do so literally thousands of times a year without firing a shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this time, the police were the shooters. And they had fired 50 shots after only a warning about a gun that was either in an undercover cop's imagination or in his hand, depending on who you believe did the shouting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY MICHAEL SAUL DAILY NEWS CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF With Lisa L. Colangelo</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Pg. 4</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">523 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEFORE HE SAID a word, those who stood silently next to Mayor Bloomberg at City Hall yesterday already spoke volumes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sen. Malcolm Smith was immediately to his right. Rep. Charles Rangel stood to his rear. City Controller William Thompson also had the mayor's back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a distinct, powerful image - numerous black leaders standing with Bloomberg during a potentially racially divisive event - that underscored one of the themes of Bloomberg's mayoralty: He has consciously sought to minimize racial tensions where others in his position have only inflamed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg then opened the news conference, promising &quot;fairness, openness and justice&quot; as he tried to mollify a city enraged by the 50 police bullets that left an unarmed bridegroom dead on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first, Bloomberg spoke gingerly about the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declaring it was &quot;much too early to arrive at conclusions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We simply don't have all the facts,&quot; Bloomberg insisted. &quot;And I think it would be wrong, for us, to rush to judgment and we will not do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as reporters peppered the mayor with questions, Bloomberg let down his guard, saying the deadly spray of 50 bullets was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;inexplicable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds to me like excessive force was used,&quot; said Bloomberg, a statement that earned him a swift rebuke from the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Patrick Lynch, who called the remark &quot;premature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even before the news conference, Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly met privately at City Hall for nearly two hours with roughly three dozen elected officials and clergy members, who exhorted the mayor to express moral outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the mayor emerged from the meeting, he marched into the Blue Room with the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just wanted everybody to get their picture and understand we've just met together,&quot; said the mayor, beginning his news conference as many members of the private meeting stood with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg said yesterday he hoped to meet soon with Bell's family, and he also promised to go to Jamaica, Queens, and speak directly to the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, during the private meeting - a free-flowing discussion described by participants as tense, serious and candid - City Councilman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn) called on Bloomberg to fire Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg defended Kelly as the city's best-ever NYPD commissioner. He said Kelly will remain the city's top cop through the rest of his term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton praised Bloomberg yesterday for having &quot;better manners&quot; than his predecessor, Rudy Giuliani, but he said he was more interested in the pursuit of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barron described the mayor's response to the incident as &quot;weak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need a kinder, gentler Giuliani,&quot; Barron said. &quot;We need policy change. And if you don't want to change the polices and protect us, then, we need a regime change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, though, community leaders offered the mayor kudos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman James Sanders (D-Queens) said the shooting may be a defining moment for the mayor and his administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that he will come through this one, I trust, with flying colors,&quot; Sanders said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PEERING INTO A CAR, an undercover cop yelled, &quot;Gun! Gun!&quot; when he saw one of the passengers reaching for something in his waistband - and fired the first of 50 shots that led to the death of a bridegroom on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it was over, 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was dead, his two friends were badly wounded and no gun was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hispanic officer, whose name was not available last night, told other cops that he followed Bell and his buddies from a notorious Queens strip club to his Nissan Altima outside. He said he flashed his shield and yelled to &quot;Show your hands!&quot; before Bell clipped him with the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he saw the front-seat passenger, later identified as Joseph Guzman, reach toward his waistband, police sources told the Daily News - prompting him to fire 11 rounds at the men, beginning the deadly fusillade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial shooting led community leaders to stage two emotional meetings yesterday, one with Mayor Bloomberg and another last night with Queens District Attorney Richard Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emerging from his meeting, Bloomberg denounced the shooting - even as he cautioned against rushing to judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard for me to understand why 50-odd shots were taken,&quot; Bloomberg said at the City Hall news conference, where he stood alongside several black elected officials. &quot;To me that sounds like excessive force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly also indicated that the five cops involved in the shooting broke NYPD regulations, including those concerning the use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said NYPD rules prohibit cops from shooting at a car, even when it's being used as a weapon. He also said this appears to be a case of &quot;contagious fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We stress, when officers go to the range, that they fire no more than three rounds,&quot; he said. &quot;And, then, they look.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Bell and another of the wounded men, Trent Benefield, 23, were black, Bloomberg said it doesn't appear race figured in the early-morning shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the five officers who opened fire are black, two are white and the officer who fired the first shot is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bloomberg acknowledged the mounting anger over the fatal shooting of yet another unarmed black man. &quot;The community is outraged, and I am, to put it mildly, deeply disturbed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fianc&eacute;e had stronger words for the five officers who took away her bridegroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They murdered him,&quot; a sobbing Nicole Paultre told Brown last night at the emotional meeting with black leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources identified the white cops as Detective Mike Oliver, who fired 31 shots, and Officer Mike Carey, who fired three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the scene was Lt. Jerry Napoli, a white 23-year veteran who ducked for cover under a dashboard when the shooting started, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names of the other officers who discharged their guns were not available last night. They have all been placed on administrative leave and ordered to surrender their weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino called the shooting justified because Bell was using his car as a &quot;lethal weapon.&quot; He continued to blame the victims yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the driver of the vehicle had responded to the detective's command this would not have happened,&quot; he said. &quot;He would be a married man today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly conceded that one of the two undercover officers who were also inside the Kalua Cabaret on 94th Ave. in Jamaica before the shooting had a couple of beers, but he said it was not a factor in the incident. Sources identified that cop as a woman but did not divulge her name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We authorize them to have two drinks and no more,&quot; he said. &quot;This whole initiative started at 1 o'clock in the morning. So they were in the club for as long as three hours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops making an arrest are supposed to identify themselves, but the NYPD has found no witnesses who say they did, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield, who was hit three times and was in stable condition yesterday, told a pal that he and those in the car thought the cops were hoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't know they were cops,&quot; said Shamel O'Neal, 20, after visiting Benefield at Mary Immaculate Hospital. &quot;They thought they were in trouble. They feared for their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman, 31, was in critical condition last night and undergoing surgery to remove bullets from his body. He was shot 11 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police and witness accounts, this is the most credible version of the tragic shooting:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life-long pals, Benefield and Guzman had taken Bell out for a stag night at the club, which undercover cops were investigating for drugs and prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they left at 4 a.m., Bell exchanged angry words with another patron outside the club and one of his friends referred to a gun, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undercover cops are supposed to hang back to keep from being unmasked and let other officers make a bust. But when Bell and his pals continued on to Liverpool St. to the groom's car, the Hispanic cop was hot on their heels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was still acting in the undercover capacity when he followed the group down the street,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;He did, apparently, take some enforcement action, and that's unusual, yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said Bell clipped the officer with his car and then twice rammed into the cops' unmarked minivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still some question of whether a fourth man was about to get into Bell's car; a witness has told The News he saw that man bolt when the undercover cop approached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, some black leaders called on Bloomberg to fire Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Amadou] Diallo, 41 shots. This is 50 shots,&quot; said Charles Aziz Bilal, a spokesman for Guzman's family and the imam of the Al-Han-Dullah Mosque in Queens. &quot;What's next, 60 shots, 70 shots, 90 shots? When will it stop?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In venturing that the fatal 50-bullet police shooting was &quot;unacceptable or inexplicable,&quot; Mayor Bloomberg rendered a fair preliminary assessment of a tragedy that, more and more, appears to have stemmed from a failure to follow proper NYPD procedures by cops who were on the front lines in the war on illegal guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's frankness - and the accompanying openness of Police Commissioner Ray Kelly - had the salutary effect of channeling outrage over the death of 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> toward the constructive purposes of completing an investigation into potential criminal liability and reviewing how to avoid a recurrence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members of the NYPD have taken Bloomberg's statement as a rush to judgment by a politician seeking to quell upset among New York City blacks, while a small number of black voices have declared Bell's killing and the wounding of two friends to be evidence of systemic, institutionalized, racially motivated brutality. On both extremes, the perspectives are wholly unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facts are facts, and Bloomberg and Kelly have made the right moves in releasing them as they've become known, incomplete and unpleasant as they are, as well as in keeping political, religious and community leaders abreast of developments. Overwhelmingly, those leaders have responded with anger tempered by reason. Generally speaking, there is wise recognition of what this incident does and does not represent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the evidence is now known, the shooting was a marked aberration from the professionalism and restraint displayed daily by the NYPD - and one based on an unusual confluence of misapprehensions. After an altercation involving threats of a gun outside a crime-prone strip club, Bell and his friends may well have seen as a menace an undercover cop following them, while the cop and his team were clearly concerned about getting fired upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young men, unarmed, attempted to flee, striking the undercover officer with their car and colliding with an unmarked police van. The undercover opened fire, squeezing off 11 shots, while another cop let go of 31 rounds in a matter of seconds. Both, the evidence suggests, lost touch with the rules of engagement while their colleagues were also firing their weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first instance, the NYPD patrol guide generally forbids firing on a moving vehicle, and in the second instance, it is inconceivable that the officer who fired 31 times had a solid grasp of whom or what he was shooting at. A cardinal rule of the department says cops should reassess their targets after firing three rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smell is of fear, not of wanton brutality or of gunplay that fits a pattern of excessive force. In fact, in the average shooting incident, cops fire fewer than four bullets. And with the undercover team composed of black, white and Hispanic officers, race is not the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decision as to bringing criminal charges against any of the cops will depend on a probe by Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. More information will emerge and come into play before a grand jury takes such a grave and fateful step. Fair-minded New Yorkers will withhold judgment until all the evidence is in. And everyone should remember that these apparently errant cops had set out with the intention of getting an illegal gun, which they believed to exist, off the street - noble work and demanding of great bravery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only yesterday, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn began the trial of Ronell Wilson, who is charged with the 2003 executions of Detectives James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews. The detectives had tried to buy guns from Wilson and wound up paying with their lives, according to the indictment. Here, because there are too many illegal weapons on the streets, Bell died on the very day he was to be married to Nicole Paultre, the mother of his two young children. This is not meant to excuse officers who failed to rise to the challenge. It is only to emphasize how gross the tragedy is.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend's senseless shooting of three unarmed men in Queens by undercover officers, combined with other disturbing indicators, shows that Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly's NYPD is failing to protect and serve the public the way it should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything we know about the slaughter of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the grievous wounding of Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield in a hail of bullets suggests the cops involved were poorly supervised - and, at a minimum, broke department rules by firing, over and over, at a moving car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no evidence whatsoever that [Bell and his friends] were doing anything wrong, period,&quot; is how Mayor Bloomberg put it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops will get their day in court, but there's a larger pattern of possible NYPD misconduct that Kelly must address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Independent Budget Office, the Civilian Complaint Review Board got 5,089 complaints in 2003, and the number increased to 6,358 last year, a spike of 25%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department says cases jumped due to the ease of making complaints through the 311 system. And a bunch came from protesters arrested during the 2004 Republican National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in fiscal 2004, according to IBO spokesman Doug Turetsky, the city was hit with 1,856 lawsuits alleging false arrest, assault, excessive force or other wrongdoing by cops. The number of claims jumped to 2,080 in fiscal 2006, an increase of 12%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cases drain millions from the public treasury. In fiscal 2004, the government settled claims totaling $42.6 million, a 23% increase from the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes, on average, 4 1/2 years to resolve each police action claim, so a lot of the money being shelled out today stems from police conduct that predates Kelly's current stint as commissioner under Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 353 police action claims were filed in July and August of this year, a 22% increase from the 289 claims during the same months last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go beyond the statistics and it looks like Kelly has been slow to act on anecdotal evidence that brutality and misconduct are on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, 17-year-old Xavier Simpson, the son of a city correction officer, turned up with a broken arm and ankle, claiming he was walking down a Queens street, then &quot;grabbed, choked, beaten, kicked, punched, stomped - everything&quot; by cops from the 105th Precinct who stopped and questioned Simpson and allegedly didn't like the teen's answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police charged Simpson with resisting arrest and obstructing traffic, but prosecutors dropped the charges. Simpson announced plans to sue the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, the Rev. Calvin Butts of Harlem got into a heated verbal altercation with cops over a traffic ticket that nearly turned physical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last month, black and Latino cops went public with allegations that a captain in a Brooklyn transit district ordered them to stop all black males exiting a Park Slope station - an action Kelly said resulted from a &quot;misunderstanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make matters worse, a long downward trend in violent crime has sputtered to a halt. Murders citywide are up 7.5% this year, and some areas are seeing huge increases. Homicides are up by 20% in Staten Island compared with last year, up 43% in northern Manhattan and up 17% in north Brooklyn and the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Kelly's department has announced a series of police sweeps in 11 tough precincts. That's a good first step - but only if the cops get trained to go after real crime and not innocent citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK MAYOR BELIEVES COPS USED EXCESSIVE FORCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in on the uproar over a deadly police shooting Monday, saying bluntly that officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man in a confrontation outside a strip club hours before his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,&quot; Bloomberg said at a news conference after meeting with elected officials and community leaders, including Rev. Al Sharpton and Representative Charles Rangel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early Saturday after a bachelor party at the strip club. Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton called it a &quot;very candid&quot; meeting. He said the message to Bloomberg was: &quot;This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.&quot; Some have also questioned whether the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were all black. The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 KILLED IN GROUP HOME SUSPICIOUS FIRE IN MISSOURI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANDERSON, Mo. - An early morning fire broke out in a group home for the elderly and mentally ill Monday, killing 10 people and injuring two dozen others in a blaze that the governor said was being treated as a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blaze reduced the privately run Anderson Guest House to a skeleton of cinder blocks and stunned this rural community of about 1,800 people tucked in the Ozark hills about 55 kilometres south of Joplin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gov. Matt Blunt said investigators were treating the fire as suspicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not saying it is definitely a crime scene, but we are treating it as if it is and trying to determine if the fire was set by somebody who had a nefarious motive,&quot; Blunt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EUROPE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.K. TRACKS RADIOACTIVE SITES AFTER POISONING DEATH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON - The British government began tracking radioactive hotspots in London on Monday to trace the poison that killed a former KGB agent, and three people who reported possible symptoms of contamination underwent testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain announced a formal inquest into the death of Alexander Litvinenko, but Home Secretary John Reid warned against rushing to conclusions over who might be responsible for the killing of the ex-spy turned Kremlin critic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Litvinenko died Thursday after falling ill from what doctors said was poisoning by polonium-210, a radioactive isotope usually manufactured in specialized nuclear facilities. High doses of polonium, which is deadly if ingested or inhaled, were found in Litvinenko's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The nature of this radiation is such that it does not travel over long distances, a few centimetres at most, and therefore there is no need for public alarm,&quot; Reid said in a special address to the House of Commons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BALMY WEATHER MEANS THAT FROGS CAN'T SLEEP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BERLIN - An unusually warm autumn in Germany is wreaking havoc in the normal behaviour patterns of the country's wildlife, keeping birds from flying south for the winter and frogs from sleeping, experts said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With November temperatures in some areas hovering around the 20C mark in some regions, biologists have observed major disruptions to nature's normal rhythms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wildlife expert Peter Schuetz with the environment department of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia said that migratory birds such as cranes appeared to have &quot;no desire&quot; to head south due to the balmy temperatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because they continue to find food on the ground in harvested cornfields, there is little impulse to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWSPAPER'S APPEAL OF DIARY DECISION BEGINS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON - The Court of Appeal in London on Monday began hearing a case brought by Prince Charles against the Mail on Sunday after the publication by the weekly of extracts from a private journal belonging to the heir to the throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associated Newspapers, the Mail on Sunday's parent company, appealed a decision in March by the High Court which ruled in favour of the prince over his diary chronicling the hand-over of Hong Kong to China in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision temporarily blocked publication of seven other entries in Charles's private journal, which the Mail on Sunday had in its possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prince of Wales had brought a case against the newspaper after the publication in November 2005 of extracts containing a harsh critique of the ceremonies marking the restitution of Hong Kong to China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the diary entry, entitled The Handover of Hong Kong -- or The Great Chinese Takeaway, the Prince had described China's leaders as &quot;appalling old waxworks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SLAVE TRADE CONDEMNED BUT NO APOLOGY FROM BLAIR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON - Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned the African slave trade and expressed deep sorrow for Britain's role -- but stopped short Monday of offering an apology or compensation for the descendants of those victimized by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists are putting pressuring on Britain to offer an apology -- and reparations -- for its role in slavery before it marks the 200th anniversary of the law that banned the country's participation in the Atlantic slave trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair wrote in an article in the New Nation newspaper it is right to recognize the active role Britain, its ports and its industry once played in the trafficking of human beings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the bicentenary offers us a chance not just to say how profoundly shameful the slave trade was -- how we condemn its existence utterly and praise those who fought for its abolition -- but also to express our deep sorrow that it ever happened, that it ever could have happened,&quot; Blair wrote in the black community newspaper.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SRI LANKAN PEACE EFFORTS WRITTEN OFF BY REBEL CHIEF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DELHI - Tamil Tiger rebels in Sri Lanka signalled a return to all-out war Monday when the group's leadership said efforts to find a negotiated settlement to the 23-year civil war were now &quot;defunct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years after Norwegian intermediaries attempted to broker a solution to an ethnic war, which has killed 65,000 people, the Tigers' secretive leader said the process was effectively dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement by Velupillai Prabhakaran comes after rising violence in which the Sinhala-majority government in Colombo and separatist Tamil guerrillas in Sri Lanka's north and east have clashed with increasing ferocity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prabhakaran used his annual &quot;Heroes Day&quot; speech Monday to declare his desire for an &quot;independent&quot; Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka and apparently walk away from negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AMERICA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COLOMBIAN CABBIE ROLLS ROBBER OVER EMBANKMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOGOTA - A Colombian taxi driver got the better of an armed robber by rolling his cab over an embankment -- with the assailant still inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver, whom police identified as Isidro, 66, suffered a stab wound from the would-be thief, 16, who landed in hospital with multiple fractures, police said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isidro's wife said her husband's wound was slight, but he feared the thief would kill him and so rolled his hack toward the embankment and jumped to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The robber wanted to take the driver's income for that day, some $40, said Santander province police chief Alvaro Miranda, adding that the incident took place in Bucaramanga, Colombia's fifth-largest city, near the Venezuelan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities in Bucaramanga said the city of one million inhabitants is seeing a spike in attacks against taxis and other public transportation, largely by adolescents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FIVE COPS INVOLVED IN the fatal shooting of an unarmed bridegroom on his wedding day were put on administrative leave yesterday as prosecutors prepared to take the case to a grand jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new developments came as hundreds of furious protesters, led by the dead man's bride-to-be and his weeping 3-year-old daughter, took to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is like the Wild, Wild West,&quot; said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at the wedding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Nicole Paultre. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty shots, and no one is shooting back at you? That's an execution. It's like putting them in front of a firing line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was shot in the neck and killed when plainclothes cops unloaded 50 shots on his Nissan Altima after his bachelor party at a Queens strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His friends, Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23, were wounded in the 4 a.m. incident outside the Kalua Cabaret on 94th Ave. in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As outrage at the shootings of the three unarmed black men swelled, city officials scrambled to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown was preparing to present evidence to a grand jury &quot;in the next few days,&quot; a source said. He is to meet this morning with a homicide investigator and the head of his investigations unit to review the Saturday morning bloodshed, the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD, meanwhile, put the five officers who fired on paid administrative leave and asked them to surrender their weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names of the officers were not released, and none of them have been interviewed by investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg, who spoke to the 22-year-old Paultre on Saturday, has arranged a meeting today with community leaders at City Hall to discuss the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg, believed to have been at his Bermuda home over the weekend, spent yesterday calling or e-mailing black leaders, including Rep. Charles Rangel (D-Harlem), the Rev. Floyd Flake and former Mayor David Dinkins. &quot;He said he was doing everything he could to find out what happened,&quot; City Councilman Leroy Comrie (D-Queens) said of Bloomberg. &quot;He wanted to assure me he was engaged, involved, and that we would get to the bottom of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New details about the sequence of events emerged yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends of Bell, Benefield and Guzman told cops the trio mistook the plainclothes officers conducting surveillance at the club for robbers and tried to get away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell clipped an undercover officer who was on foot with his car and then twice rammed into the cops' unmarked minivan - and the cops opened fire, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover cop fired the first shot, followed by 10 more rounds, a law enforcement source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A white plainclothes detective who was in the rammed van got out and fired 31 shots, stopping to reload.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second officer in the van fired three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lieutenant overseeing the surveillance operation who was in an unmarked Toyota Camry ducked down behind the dashboard when the first shots rang out, thinking he was under fire, a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two officers riding with the lieutenant got out of the Camry and opened fire, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, a 17-year veteran, fired four times, while the other officer, who has nine years on the force, fired once, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the officers are white, two are black and one is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said statements an undercover officer overheard inside the club led police to believe the men were going to retrieve a weapon. No gun was found in Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trini Wright, 28, a dancer at the club, insisted the cops opened fire without identifying themselves. She was planning to go with Bell and his friends to a diner and was putting her makeup bag in the trunk of their car when the cops' minivan appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minivan came around the corner and smashed into their car. And they [the cops] jumped out shooting,&quot; Wright told The News. &quot;No 'stop.' No 'freeze.' No nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police were looking for signs of prostitution and drugs at the club when the shooting broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But supporters of the three shot men said there was no excuse for what transpired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where Guzman was in critical condition and Benefield was in stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to understand that all of us were in that car,&quot; Sharpton told about 300 protesters, who chanted, &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; and counted to 50 to represent the number of shots fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters marched several blocks to the hospital from Community Church of Christ, where a service was held earlier. During the march, Paultre collapsed and had to be supported by people surrounding her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMADOU DIALLO'S mother learned of the latest NYPD shooting in the most ironic of settings: an East Village screening of a documentary about her son's 1999 death at the hands of city cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hoping that after all these years of speaking and marching and protesting to ask about the end of police shootings - like my son was killed - that we would never see such a thing again,&quot; Kadiatou Diallo said yesterday about Saturday's shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the reason why people should not forget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She vowed to join with protesters calling for a thorough investigation of the police shooting of Bell and his two friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, who remain hospitalized. The three unarmed men were shot by cops outside a Queens strip club after a bachelor party for Bell, who was to be married Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They stood with us for Amadou. I will join the community to join our common voices,&quot; said Diallo, who lives in Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amadou Diallo was 22 when he was shot to death Feb. 4, 1999, by cops who fired 41 bullets as he stood, unarmed, in the doorway of his Bronx apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops were acquitted of all criminal charges by an Albany jury, but the city later paid the Diallo family $3 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadiatou Diallo was at Anthology Archives on Saturday afternoon to speak about the documentary, &quot;Death of Two Sons,&quot; when a member of the audience told her about Bell's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie, directed by Micah Schaffer and shown as part of the African Diaspora Film Festival, delves into Amadou Diallo's slaying and the car-crash death of Peace Corps volunteer Jesse Thyne, an American who lived with Diallo's family in Guinea, Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a mother who lost a son in a police shooting, I think this is unbearable,&quot; she said yesterday. &quot;It's so sad to see this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she regretted not being able to participate in the rallies across the city yesterday, and planned to contact the Rev. Al Sharpton to lend her support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called on police to take responsibility for their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NYPD also needs to be reminded that we thank them for the wonderful job they are doing, but they have to help us,&quot; Diallo said. &quot;This is why we need to raise awareness, until people at large in all communities will have good policing without killing people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">EDITORIAL; Pg. 38</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">708 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two facts are beyond dispute in the sketchy events surrounding Saturday morning's fatal police shooting in Queens. The first and most tragic is that 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is dead while two friends are hospitalized with multiple bullet wounds. The second is that police officers fired 50 shots into a moving car, into homes, into a train station and who knows where else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a grand jury probe has only begun, the number of slugs and trajectories suggest a serious departure from the discipline for which the NYPD is known. As a result, a young life was taken, two were scarred, a bride-to-be lost her groom, and five cops, who set out to do their duty, are facing potential criminal charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops appear not to have been trigger happy. None had previously fired his or her weapon in the line of duty. But, quite likely, they were afraid. And, just as likely, Bell and his friends became afraid on encountering the cops, armed and undercover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was about 4 a.m. in the environs of a Jamaica strip club that had a &quot;chronic history of narcotics, prostitution and weapons complaints,&quot; according to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. The cops, who happen to be black and Hispanic and white, were looking for evidence that would enable authorities to shut down the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports, there was talk, erroneous it turned out, of a gun among Bell and his companions, all of them black, who had patronized the club for a bachelor party. Then there was a street altercation. Then, attempting to drive away, the young men rammed an undercover police van, likely mistaking the plainclothes officers for a threat. Then the bullets started flying. When they stopped, one cop had fired 31 times, 16 times before reloading, 15 times after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether that officer and the others reasonably believed themselves to be in grave danger - or whether there was panic - will be key to determining legal accountability. Because simply being afraid does not justify pumping off a single round, let alone taking a life while putting at risk lives in a crowded neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the officers were put on administrative leave and their weapons were confiscated. This is at it should be. So, too, Kelly's expression of sympathy for families who expected to celebrate the wedding of Bell and Nicole Paultre, the mother of Bell's two children. Outraged and grief-stricken, relatives and friends are calling for justice. And they are on solid ground in doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For justice must be done and flaws in police training must be addressed - based on the facts as they are elicited by DA Richard Brown, who must deliver on a promised fair and complete probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The object is not to advance a cause, as family spokesman the Rev. Al Sharpton urged, saying, &quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen. We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.&quot; Nor is it to go easy on lethal dereliction out of sympathy for cops who were working to rid a predominantly minority community of a dangerous quality-of-life scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York needs to examine this one down the middle, to get to the bottom of how a young man ended up dead and two ended up wounded by five cops after they all set out with good intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soo-eee!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging by that surest of barometers, the Voice of the People, New Yorkers are plenty mad at the retroactive pay raise the City Council voted for itself. One correspondent, Voicer Milton Katzis of Manhattan, nailed the outrage by pointing out that the starting salary for the NYPD is $25,100 while Council members get $112,500, plus additional stipends called lulus, plus unlimited private income. All of which reminded us that the Council piggies followed only one recommendation of the mayoral commission that justified a 25% pay hike. The piggies rushed through the raise while dismissing without action the panel's call for, among other reforms, abolishing lulus. And now the piggies posture as fiscal hawks, oinking ludicrously against no-bid school contracts that have actually saved millions upon millions of dollars. Speaker Christine Quinn (photo) and her squealers have zero credibility as guardians of the purse and will not regain what little credibility they did have until they pass the reforms that were supposed to accompany their raises. Oink.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEARS ROLLED down the cheek of Jada Bell yesterday, telling of the sadness and confusion a little girl feels when she learns her daddy won't be coming home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 3-year-old daughter of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is too young to understand how he died in a hail of 50 police bullets Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family had to explain the loss to her in the simplest and most heartbreaking of terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hardest part is that Jada still wants her father,&quot; said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at the wedding of Jada's parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that when Jada's puppy died recently, her dad told her to look to the sky, explaining, &quot;When you see the sun, that's the puppy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This morning, we had to tell her, 'Daddy is taking care of the puppy. Look up and say hi to Daddy,'&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jada's mother, Nicole Paultre, was also having difficulty grasping the tragedy that left her alone, walking through the streets to ask for justice instead of celebrating her first day of marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are in shock, extreme shock,&quot; Williams said. &quot;The young lady called me and said, 'Can I still be married?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was killed after his bachelor party at a Queens strip club, just hours before he was supposed to be married to Paultre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives said he was planning to move his family to Georgia once he tied the knot. Bell's cousin Kinglarry Crawford, 35, said Paultre's father was going to buy the newlyweds a home in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who had worked various jobs, including one as a UPS driver, wanted to raise two children in a quiet place with more opportunities, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is devastated,&quot; Crawford added. &quot;He is the first person in this family to be murdered.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE THREE MEN shot by cops in Queens grew up together and stuck by each other through good times - and bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives and neighbors insisted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield were family men whose friendship revolved around the positive things in life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all three also had criminal records, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell had been arrested twice in the past eight months on drug charges and he was busted in 2000 as a juvenile for possession of a firearm and three air pistols, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman's record includes nine arrests for drug offenses, but he had not been collared since a felony drug charge in 2002. He pleaded guilty in that case and recently completed parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield was arrested in connection with a gunpoint robbery in 2002 and a drug bust in 2004, and cops have three arrest warrants for him on mostly minor charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those details were far from the minds of the trio's loved ones yesterday as controversy deepened over the shooting that left Bell dead and Guzman and Benefield wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, they painted a picture of vibrant young men from the streets of Far Rockaway bound together through tough economic times and growing pains by shared interests and history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were real good friends for a long time,&quot; said Tyheem Browning, 17, Guzman's brother. All three men loved kids. Bell, 23, and Guzman, 31, had families of their own; Benefield's girlfriend is expecting a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also found common ground through sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who left behind two young daughters, was a star baseball player in high school. Guzman loves to shoot hoops near his home in Ocean Village, a high-rise housing development. Benefield, 23, worked in construction and coached youth basketball teams in his Jamaica neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He lived to teach little kids,&quot; said Melissa Morgan, 37, a neighbor of Benefield. &quot;He wanted to keep kids safe, teach them and support them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the kids in the community love him,&quot; added Tamara Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman also worked construction jobs and doted on his two children, Tyshaun, 11, and Juwan, 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He spends a lot of time with his kids,&quot; Browning said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The white detective who squeezed off 31 of 50 shots at three unarmed men outside a Queens strip joint had a clean record, never fired his gun in the line of duty and was known as a good street cop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His unblemished history left fellow officers puzzled yesterday over what led the 12-year veteran to get down on one knee and empty two clips on the darkened Jamaica street early Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He lost it. Four or five rounds - maybe. But to reload? It's hard to understand. Even in the heat of the moment, it's overkill,&quot; a law enforcement source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, seven plainclothes officers were involved in what should have been a textbook prostitution sting as part of the city's effort to shutter the Kalua Cabaret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the NYPD has interviewed only two cops - the ones who did not fire: an undercover detective who remained outside the club and a lieutenant who ducked behind the dashboard of his unmarked car when bullets flew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioning the officers who fired falls to the Queens district attorney's office, which sources said plans to present the case to a grand jury this week. Of the five, two are white, two are black and one is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the 12-year vet, the other officers involved in the shooting are:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything from the number of shell casings around the car to the absence of a gun inside it to the witness accounts suggests the police officers who shot three unarmed young men early Saturday morning did so in the mistaken and panicked belief they were in mortal danger. The same facts and statements suggest the three young men in the car who repeatedly tried to crash past an unmarked police van did so in their own mistaken and panicked belief they were in mortal danger. One was climbing into the back of the car when he saw a tall figure in street attire approach in the early morning darkness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yo, my man, come here, my man, let me holler at you,&quot; the figure was heard to call out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tall figure was holding something black by his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's got a gat! He's got a gat! Be out! Be out!&quot; the young man climbing into the car shouted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure was an undercover cop, but by one witness account neither he nor his comrades announced themselves as police officers until after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tried in vain to drive away and six to 10 shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's when somebody started shouting, 'Police! Police! Put your hands out! Put your hands out!'&quot; recalls witness China Flores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting only intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's when all hell broke loose,&quot; Flores says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cop fired 31 times, but regardless of how he is ultimately judged by the law, a harsher public judgment should be reserved for the senior commander at the scene. This lieutenant is said to have been so certain he was being fired upon he ducked under the dashboard of his undercover vehicle while the cops he was supposed to supervise fired a total of 50 rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flores says a fourth young man who was about to join the three in the Altima dashed off, making a cell phone call on the next block. Flores also says that one of the three in the car, Trent Benefield, staggered out holding his right upper leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's shouting, 'Stop shooting at me! Stop shooting at me!'&quot; Flores reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flores says a shorter plainclothes cop kept firing at Benefield after he hit the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[The cop] is telling him, 'Lay down! Lay down!'&quot; Flores recalls. &quot;The guy's already on the floor. He's shot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after the last shot was fired did Flores see the tall figure produce a badge and affix it to his jacket. Thus ended a chain of events Flores had seen begin around the corner in the Kalua Cabaret a short time before, when Bell, Benefield and Joey Guzman got into a verbal argument with two Guyanese men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flores says a would-be gangster known as J-Rock sought to get involved even though he did not know either party. J-Rock supposedly intimated he had a gun, threatening to &quot;pop off.&quot; The situation was clearly not what Bell had in mind for his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said, 'Let's be out. I'm getting married. I don't need this,'&quot; Flores recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Bell and his friends departed, the Guyanese men followed and more words were exchanged in the foyer. The bouncer rose from his stool and broke it up, ordering them into the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By then, Flores was outside having a cigarette as they exited. He says Guzman raised a hand toward one of the Guyanese men with the thumb upraised, the index finger extended in either the suggestion of a gun or just a hip-hop gesture that often accompanies outsized threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to f--k him up!&quot; Guzman supposedly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield echoed Bell's sentiment that the time had come to &quot;be out&quot; and the friends headed down to Liverpool St. Flores noticed they were tailed by a tall figure in a quilted jacket, jeans and tan Timberland boots who likely witnessed Guzman's gesture. Flores followed, watching the tall figure get on a cell phone, then climb into a Toyota Camry that rolled up 94th Ave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Camry turned onto Liverpool St. Flores did so in time to see the tall figure approach Bell and the others as they climbed into a parked Altima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Flores heard Benefield shout, &quot;He's got a gat!&quot; A boast in a club, or a hand gesture, apparently made the cops fear the same as the Altima tried to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They must have got scared,&quot; Flores says. &quot;They thought the guys in the car had a gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the safest big city in America proved still so fearful of guns that cops who set out that night to keep us safe ended up killing an unarmed young man on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON A DAY OF RAGE and sorrow, a source told the Daily News yesterday that prosecutors are expected to ask a grand jury this week to probe the fatal shooting of an unarmed groom on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As hundreds of protesters took to the streets to demand justice, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown was preparing to present the case to the panel &quot;in the next few days,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown is to meet this morning with his homicide investigator and the head of his investigations unit to review evidence in the Saturday morning shooting outside a strip club, the source said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five NYPD officers who fired their weapons were placed on paid administrative leave yesterday and asked to surrender their weapons, as the Rev. Al Sharpton led a rally outside the hospital where the two survivors were being treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names of the officers were not released, and none of them has been interviewed by investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mayor Bloomberg has arranged a meeting with community leaders at City Hall to discuss the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg, believed to have been at his Bermuda home over the weekend, spent yesterday calling or e-mailing black leaders, including Rep. Charles Rangel, the Rev. Floyd Flake and former Mayor David Dinkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said he was doing everything he could to find out what happened,&quot; City Councilman Leroy Comrie (D-Queens) said of Bloomberg. &quot;He wanted to assure me he was engaged, involved, and that we would get to the bottom of what happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, praised NYPD brass for &quot;allowing the investigation to proceed before rushing to any judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the officers opened fire on the car carrying the three men when the driver, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rammed their unmarked minivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, who was to be married later Saturday to the mother of his two children, was shot in the neck and killed. His friends, Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23, were wounded in the 4 a.m. incident outside the Kalua Cabaret on 94th Ave. in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said statements an undercover officer overheard inside the club led police to believe the men were going to retrieve a weapon. No gun was found in Bell's car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends who had attended a bachelor party for Bell at the club told cops Bell, Benefield and Guzman mistook the plainclothes officers for robbers and were trying to get away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Hispanic undercover officer who was rammed by the minivan fired the first shot, followed by 10 more rounds. A white plainclothes detective who was in the rammed van got out and fired 31 shots, stopping to reload. The second officer in the van fired three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lieutenant overseeing the surveillance operation was in an unmarked police car and ducked down behind the dashboard when the first shots rang out, thinking he was under fire, a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two officers riding with the lieutenant got out of the unmarked Toyota Camry and opened fire, police said. One, a 17-year veteran, fired four times, while the other officer, who has nine years on the force, fired once, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trini Wright, 28, a dancer at the club, insisted the cops opened fire without identifying themselves. She was going with Bell and his friends to a diner and was putting her makeup bag in the trunk of their car when the cops' minivan appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minivan came around the corner and smashed into their car. And they [the cops] jumped out shooting,&quot; Wright told The News. &quot;No 'stop.' No 'freeze.' No nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police were looking for signs of prostitution and drugs at the club when the shooting broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; Sharpton said outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where Guzman was in critical condition and Benefield was in stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to understand that all of us were in that car,&quot; Sharpton told about 300 protesters, who chanted, &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; and counted to 50 to represent the number of shots fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters, including Bell's grieving bride-to-be, Nicole Paultre, had marched several blocks to the hospital from Community Church of Christ, where a service was held earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the march, Paultre collapsed and had to be boosted by people surrounding her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton compared the shooting to that of Amadou Diallo, the 22-year-old unarmed African immigrant who was shot 41 times in 1999 by police as he was reaching for his wallet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a case that is going to be a watershed case like Diallo was,&quot; Sharpton said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers fired 50 rounds at a car in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his friends were travelling after the vehicle crashed into an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, who was driving, was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital after being shot in the neck, arm and shoulder. He had been due to wed the mother of his two young daughters, aged three and five months, hours later. Instead, Nicole Paultre, 22, was driven to a New York hospital to identify the body of her high-school sweetheart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other men in the car were also hit, one 11 times. Raymond Kelly, the New York police commissioner, said it was too early to say if the shooting was justified. The district attorney's office is investigating.</SPAN></P>

The officers opened fire after the men twice ran into an unmarked NYPD van. The spray of bullets hit the car 21 times. One officer fired his gun 31 times, emptying two full magazines, Kelly said. He would not say what prompted the officers to open fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Guzman, 31, who was in the front seat and shot at least 11 times, was critical in hospital. Trent Benefield, 23, was hit three times and described as stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident drew an outcry from community leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton told ABC's Good Morning America that the volume of shots fired alone raised questions about the police's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How does one justify 50 shots at unarmed men?&quot; Sharpton asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This stinks. Something about the story being told does not seem right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After visiting the two wounded men in hospital, Sharpton said he was outraged to find the pair handcuffed to their hospital beds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - An angry crowd demanded Sunday to know why New York City police officers killed an unarmed man on the day of his wedding, firing dozens of shots that also wounded two of the man's friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some called for the ouster of the city's police commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a vigil and rally the day after 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was supposed to have married the mother of his two young children, a crowd led by Rev. Al Sharpton shouted: &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the crowd of a few hundred counted to 50, the number of rounds fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; Sharpton said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the wounded men was in critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shootings occurred at about 4 a.m. Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club where Bell's bachelor party was held. The survivors were Joseph Guzman, 31, who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, 23, who was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition Sunday and Benefield was stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car, driven by Bell, was struck by 21 of the police bullets after the vehicle rammed an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD minivan. Other shots hit nearby homes and shattered windows at a train station, though no one else was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police thought one of the men in the car might have had a gun but investigators found no weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXTREMIST CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTING TO MURDER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELFAST, Northern Ireland - The Protestant extremist who triggered a panicked evacuation of the Northern Ireland Assembly was charged Saturday with attempting to murder four people, including Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Stone, who was tackled by unarmed guards Friday at the entrance to Stormont Parliamentary Building, was arraigned in Belfast Magistrates Court on five charges of attempted murder. He also was charged with possession of weapons for terrorist purposes, including explosives, several nail bombs, an axe, a strangulation device and a fake handgun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stone has been an icon of Protestant extremism in Northern Ireland since March 16, 1988, when, armed with handguns and grenades, he single-handedly attacked more than 20,000 mourners at an IRA funeral. He killed three people, including an IRA member, and wounded about 60 others before running out of bullets and grenades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stone was convicted in 1989 of six murders among other offences and sentenced to more than 700 years in prison. He was paroled in mid-2000 as part of the U.S.-brokered Good Friday peace accord of 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's Northern Ireland Office said Saturday its legal advisers have drafted a revocation order requiring Stone to resume serving his previous sentence, an action virtually certain to confine him for years even before the new charges are resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ITALY'S BERLUSCONI FEELS 'FINE' AFTER COLLAPSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME - Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi collapsed briefly Sunday while making a political speech in a stuffy sports hall but later insisted he was feeling better, Italian media reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm doing fine, I'm doing fine,&quot; Berlusconi, 70, was quoted as saying by the ANSA news agency at his home near the northern city of Milan, hours after dramatic live television pictures showed him closing his eyes and slowly collapsing at a podium as he gave a speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fatigue, the heat, the (cartilage) operation I had&quot; in November led him to faint as he addressed political supporters in Montecatini, near Florence on Sunday, the right-wing former premier said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But all these things, even together, are nothing serious,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media magnate is to remain in hospital in Milan for a day under observation because, he said, doctors &quot;saw something on the electrocardiogram.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'ADOLF HITLER' ATTACKS JEWISH SCHOOL IN VIENNA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VIENNA - A man who apparently gave his name as Adolf Hitler wrecked a Jewish school in Vienna early Sunday, shattering windows and doors and attacking washroom facilities with an iron bar, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear, however, whether the attack against the Lauder Chabat school was an anti-Semitic act, or whether the suspect, who said he was Croatian but refused to reveal his identity, was mentally disturbed, said Ariel Muzicant, president of the Jewish community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You ask yourself anyway what a man is thinking when he attacks a school like this and causes so much destruction,&quot; Muzicant added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFFENDING CANINES COULD GET CRIMINAL RECORDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRUSSELS - Misbehaving Belgian dogs could find themselves with a &quot;criminal record&quot; under a new parliamentary proposal, with offenders facing anything from a rap on the paws to the death penalty, according to a newspaper report Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the proposal, adopted by the Senate upper house's social affairs committee, dogs and their owners would both come under scrutiny, with anyone who has served a six-month sentence for a violent crime banned from owning a dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a dog bites anyone, as happens some 100,000 times a year in Belgium, a local official could sentence the canine offender to anything from a reprimand to the death sentence from the local burgomeister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The culprit could even be seized from his kennel without the need for a search warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our goal is to prevent accidents, without targeting any particular breed,&quot; Senator Jean-Marie Cheffert told Le Soir daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'AL-QAEDA LEADER' IN DAGESTAN KILLED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAKHACHKALA, Russia - Russian forces killed five people including a Jordanian described as an Al-Qaeda leader when shooting broke out at a house in the Caspian province of Dagestan, security sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clash occurred as forces from Russia's interior ministry and the FSB security service conducted a check on a house in the town of Khasavyurt, an official from the ministry's branch in Dagestan, near the restive province of Chechnya, told journalists at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Firing came from the house at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) and the building was surrounded. A special operation was begun to destroy the attackers. It lasted from 6 a.m. until 10 a.m.,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the five killed was Jordanian fighter Abu-Khavs, a leading Al-Qaeda representative in the Russian Caucasus, the deputy head of the FSB's Dagestan branch Mikhail Merkulov said on national television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEFTIST CLAIMS VICTORY IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUITO - Leftist economist Rafael Correa claimed victory in Ecuador's presidential election Sunday as a projection and exit polls showed him holding a lead of about 14 percentage points over his conservative rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank God, we have triumphed,&quot; Correa, 43, told cheering supporters in Quito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative tycoon Alvaro Noboa dismissed exit polls showing his rival Correa won Ecuador's run-off presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe in the actual result of the vote-by-vote count,&quot; he told Canal 10 television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he would recognize the official outcome if it confirms his rival's victory, Noboa said: &quot;Once everything is cleared up and if I am convinced, I will recognize it, otherwise, I won't recognize it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT LEAST 53 MINERS DEAD IN COAL MINE EXPLOSIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING - Explosions in two Chinese coal mines have left at least 53 workers dead and six missing, China's Xinhua News Agency and safety officials said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both blasts occurred the same day and together represent the highest reported death toll for one day in China's notoriously dangerous mines in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIAN CITY TO OUTLAW RICKSHAW RUNNERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KOLKATA, India - They have been a feature of Kolkata's streets for more than a century, but communist authorities in the sprawling city want an end to the &quot;inhuman&quot; sight of emaciated men pulling rickshaws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communist-ruled state of West Bengal plans to introduce legislation that will phase out back-breaking rickshaw-pulling in the city of 13 million people, increasingly known as a high-tech centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This inhuman mode of transport should have stopped years ago,&quot; said communist city Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COPS BLASTED 50 BULLETS at three unarmed men near a Queens strip club early yesterday, killing a groom hours before his wedding, wounding two of his pals and spurring outraged relatives of the victims to call the shooting unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was his wedding day - not his death day,&quot; said Oniaja Shepherd, 43, whose nephew, 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was slain by police gunfire. &quot;We were supposed to go to a wedding. Now we're going to a funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover detective, three plainclothes detectives and a police officer in civilian clothes hit Bell's car with 21 rounds about 4 a.m. after the Queens man twice rammed his vehicle into an unmarked NYPD van, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cop fired 31 times, pausing to reload, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, a former high school baseball phenom who had been celebrating his bachelor party at the strip club, was fatally hit by two shots to the neck and arm. Two of his friends in the car were rushed to a nearby hospital with bullet wounds, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops said there may have been a fourth person in the vehicle who fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No weapons were found on Bell or his friends, and no guns were found in their bullet-riddled car near the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hearts go out to them,&quot; Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of Bell's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's 22-year-old fianc&eacute;e was at a bridal shower on Long Island when the dad of her two kids was killed. Puffy-eyed, Nicole Paultre arrived at the scene of the shooting yesterday morning. &quot;I am the intended bride,&quot; she said before collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was at the strip club with about 20 friends, police sources said. Two undercover cops, looking to make prostitution arrests, were also inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 3 a.m., one of the undercover cops heard a bouncer suggest to a dancer that he had a gun, and the cops went outside to warn plainclothes officers in a nearby van, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hour later, a fight erupted outside the club. Bell, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield were allegedly among eight men yelling at another man, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the undercover cops heard Bell shout, &quot;Let's f--- him up,&quot; and Guzman say, &quot;Yo - go get my gun,&quot; Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's getting hot on Liverpool, for real. I think there's a gun,&quot; an undercover warned his lieutenant, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One undercover stayed at the club and the other followed the men as they got into Bell's car on Liverpool St. Bell drove forward, brushing that officer before slamming into the unmarked police van as it rounded the corner, Kelly said. The undercover officer then identified himself as a cop and fired the first round, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell threw the car into reverse and slammed into a building, then drove forward into the van again. Plainclothes cops poured from the van. Five officers at the scene began shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the investigation was ongoing. He stopped short of judging the actions of the officers involved. In 2004, he had quickly characterized the shooting of 19-year-old Timothy Stansbury by a Brooklyn cop as unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although NYPD sources said the undercover cop at yesterday's incident had identified himself as an officer before police fired, Kelly said no witnesses had confirmed that account and brass had not interviewed the cops, pending a grand jury probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a 'good shoot,' &quot; one veteran investigator said. &quot;It's a big mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg issued a statement last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it is too early to draw conclusions about this morning's shootings in Jamaica, Queens, we know that the NYPD officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,&quot; Bloomberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been &quot;in touch with community leaders&quot; throughout the day, and a mayoral spokesman said the leaders included the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's loved ones joined with Sharpton to condemn the cops' actions and demand information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorenzo Kinred, who was at the bachelor party, said he spoke to a wounded Benefield before he was put into an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police didn't identify who they were,&quot; Benefield said, according to Kinred, 32. &quot;They just pulled guns out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] saw a guy dressed just like us pulling a gun,&quot; Benefield added, Kinred said. &quot;He just wanted to try and drive away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Jamaica Hospital, where Bell died, Sharpton declared, &quot;Police do not have the right to be the judge, jury and executioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton later visited Guzman, 31, who had been in the front passenger seat, and Benefield, who was in the back seat, at Mary Immaculate Hospital. Guzman, who was in critical condition, was shot at least 11 times on the right side of his body from his neck to his feet and had 17 entrance or exit wounds. Benefield, who was in stable condition, was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said it was &quot;outrageous at best&quot; that the wounded men were handcuffed to their hospital beds. &quot;Where are they going?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the men were unshackled as soon as it was discovered they were not armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was supposed to be a special day,&quot; said Bell's father,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Les Paultre, the father of Bell's fianc&eacute;e, told cops: &quot;As you go home to your wives claiming you did your job, I want you to know you killed an innocent man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the fianc&eacute;e's mom, Laura Harper-Paultre, accused cops of killing Bell &quot;in cold blood,&quot; adding, &quot;Cops are very comfortable killing black men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police adamantly denied the shooting was racially motivated, and Kelly said two of the cops who fired are black, two are white and the fifth is Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two bullets fired during the altercation hit a parked car and another slug flew into a nearby house. A bullet also whizzed by a pair of Port Authority cops standing on an elevated AirTrain platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mom, Valerie, said cops hadn't told her anything about the shooting. &quot;They're covering up, because they know the police did wrong,&quot; she charged. &quot;You know how society works. They label all African-American men the same. They should have pulled out a badge before they started shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two undercover vice cops from Manhattan were in Kalua early yesterday, gathering evidence of prostitution for the city's effort to close the club under New York's nuisance abatement program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They needed one more arrest to prove their case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the undercover officers got tipped to the potential of a gunfight and tailed former high school baseball star </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his buddies out of the club. One of the two undercovers was among the five cops involved in the fatal shooting, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, the club was guarded by several cops and secured behind crime scene tape.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre was to have been escorted up the aisle in her bridal best to join her beloved as music played and a hall packed with friends and relatives gazed admiringly, eyes welling with happy tears.. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bitterest of tears fell as she was instead led across the emergency room linoleum at 10 a.m. yesterday to the side of her high school sweetheart, the one who had taken her to the prom, the one she had cheered as he pitched 14 strikeouts in a single game for the John Adams High baseball team, the father of their two young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell had gone off to his bachelor party at a Queens strip club the night before. She had attended her bridal shower at her mother's house and stayed over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where she was going to leave today with her limousine and her bridal party,&quot; her mother, Laura Harper-Paultre, noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometime after 4 a.m., the phone rang. The husband of Nicole's older sister had gone to the bachelor party and he was calling to report that Bell was one of three unarmed young men who had been hit by a hail of police bullets after they left the Kalua Cabaret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bride-to-be's family did not yet know Bell had tried to drive away from plainclothes cops he mistook for bad guys. Or that the cops inexplicably fired as many as 50 rounds, sending one slug into a private house, another into an Air Tran station. They did not even know what hospital and it was only by luck the first call was to the right one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said, 'Get the family and come here,'&quot; the mother recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paultres arrived at Jamaica Hospital at 4:50 a.m. They had yet to receive any word of Bell's condition 20 minutes later, when three police officers appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All they said to my daughter was, 'Are you his wife?' &quot; the mother recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bride-to-be was not going to reply, &quot;In a few hours, if he makes it.&quot; She also was not going to say no and maybe have them reply they could only speak to the immediate family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops asked for identification and she complied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked one of them, 'Is he alive?' &quot; the mother recalled. &quot;[The cop] said he didn't know anything. That was approximately 5:10 a.m. today, their wedding day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops departed. The mother and the bride-to-be waited, waited, waited in the family room. The doctors finally came in and told them Bell had been dead on arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors assured them he had suffered no physical pain, though even if he had only a last millisecond of consciousness he must have seared with regret at dying on this day. All the pain anyone could feel seemed to hit the young woman who now would never be her darling Sean's bride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She is destroyed,&quot; her mother said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other relatives of the bride and the groom arrived, including Bell's father, William. They stood outside the emergency room as they would have stood outside the wedding, joined as one family not by joy but unspeakable tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some police officers asked to speak to the family and the relatives went inside, hoping they would finally get some information regarding the shooting. Harper-Paultre emerged and said the officers had only wanted to know what happened to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bloody clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The nurses told them the 103rd Precinct took them,&quot; the mother said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family still had no official word from the police about what might have transpired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think they know what to say,&quot; the mother said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 10 a.m., the medical staff said the family could come in to see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nicole Paultre stepped shakily up to the young man with whom she was to have exchanged vows to stick by each other until death did them part. They were now forever parted even before they were joined. They would never have that one perfect kiss at the altar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bride-not-to-be remained inside the hospital with the groom-not-to-be as other family members stepped outside. Dad William Bell stood by the emergency room door, his eyes raw with unfathomable hurt as he gazed at a morning as bright as a young couple's dreams. His hand rose in the direction of the scene of the shooting a dozen blocks away, but he was pointing toward the perfect blue sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at this day,&quot; he said. &quot;It should have been a beautiful day.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THEY ARRIVED for a wedding only to find the beginnings of a funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of guests showed up at the scheduled nuptials of high school sweethearts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Nicole Paultre last night, unaware that the groom had died in a hail of police gunfire hours before. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The room in La Bella Vita catering hall in Ozone Park, Queens, where the couple would have become husband and wife, was dark. It will now be used for a reception after Bell's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Bell's mother] called this morning, and she was in shock,&quot; said hall owner Tony Modica, who was forced to return the reception's flowers and balloons. &quot;They were devastated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sign outside the hall still carried a sign last evening that the wedding of &quot;Sean &amp; Nicole&quot; was to be held upstairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hours before the scheduled 8 p.m. ceremony, Paultre's family called the catering hall to stop the delivery of a three-tiered wedding cake and the portable altar, where the couple would have been married by Bishop Lester Williams, the pastor of the Community Church of Christ in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract negotiated by the couple with the Rockaway Blvd. hall was overwritten with the word &quot;Cancel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My daughter will never be the same,&quot; said Laura Harper-Paultre, the mother of the 22-year-old bride-to-be. &quot;This was supposed to be their wedding day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives said Bell, 23, a former high school baseball star, made the decision to propose three weeks ago and popped the question to the mother of his two daughters last week in the family's Rockaway home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was the man she loved,&quot; said Susan Parker, Paultre's godmother, who helped the bride and her mother rush to buy a dress and wedding favors. &quot;Nothing will bring him back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives said about 250 people were expected to attend the wedding and reception, eat from a 12-item buffet, toast the couple with champagne, and dance to the couple's song, &quot;Here and Now&quot; by Luther Vandross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The catering hall was a favorite of the Bell family and gained local fame for its crooning owner, who created a so-called pizza dance that has entertained the likes of Frank Sinatra, John Gotti and Mayors Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was ready to be the best man in his wedding and now I'm planning his funeral,&quot; said Sean's brother William Bell, 28. &quot;It's brutal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in recent months, the itch had come back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was recently getting back into it,&quot; said his older brother, William Bell, 28. &quot;He was training seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a student at John Adams High School in Ozone Park, Queens, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a dominant pitcher in the Public Schools Athletic League.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He graduated in 2001, closing out his senior season with an 11-0 record, 97 strikeouts and a stingy 2.14 earned run average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good-hearted man,&quot; said his mother, Valerie Bell. &quot;He would have been in pro ball, but he wanted to be with his children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell pitched for Nassau Community College after leaving high school and then started a family with his fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre, 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had two daughters - Jada, 3, and Jordyn, 5 months.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COPS SHOT and killed a groom on his wedding day and wounded two other unarmed men in a barrage of gunfire near a Queens strip club early yesterday - enraging the dead man's relatives, who called the shooting unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was his wedding day - not his death day,&quot; said Oniaja Shepherd, 43, whose nephew </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed by police bullets. &quot;We were supposed to go to a wedding. Now we're going to a funeral.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover detective, three plainclothes detectives and one police officer in civilian clothes sprayed 50 shots at Bell's car about 4 a.m. after the 23-year-old Queens man twice rammed his vehicle into an unmarked NYPD van, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cop fired 31 rounds, pausing to reload, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell - a former high school baseball phenom who had been celebrating his bachelor party at the strip club - was mortally wounded. Two of his friends in the car were shot and rushed to a nearby hospital, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops said there may have been a fourth person in the car who fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No weapons were found on Bell or his friends, and no guns were found in their bullet-riddled car near the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hearts go out to them,&quot; Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of Bell's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the investigation was ongoing. He stopped short of judging the actions of the officers involved. In 2004, he had quickly characterized the shooting of 19-year-old Timothy Stansbury by a Brooklyn cop as unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources said a plainclothes cop at yesterday's scene had identified himself as an officer before police fired. But Kelly said no witnesses had confirmed that account and brass had not interviewed the cops, pending a grand jury probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a 'good shoot,' &quot; said one veteran investigator. &quot;It's a big mess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg issued a statement last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it is too early to draw conclusions about this morning's shootings in Jamaica, Queens, we know that the NYPD officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,&quot; Bloomberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been &quot;in touch with community leaders&quot; throughout the day, and a mayoral spokesman said the leaders included the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's loved ones joined with Sharpton to condemn the cops' actions and demand information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorenzo Kinred, who was at the bachelor's party, said he spoke to one of Bell's wounded pals, Trent Benefield, before he was put into an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police didn't identify who they were,&quot; Benefield said, according to Kinred, 32. &quot;They just pulled guns out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] saw a guy dressed just like us pulling a gun,&quot; Benefield added, Kinred said. &quot;He just wanted to try and drive away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Jamaica Hospital, where Bell died, Sharpton declared, &quot;Police do not have the right to be the judge, jury and executioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton later visited Joseph Guzman, 31, and Benefield at Mary Immaculate Hospital. Guzman, who was in critical condition, was shot at least 11 times on the right side of his body from his neck to his feet and had 17 entrance or exit wounds. Benefield, who was in stable condition, was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said it was &quot;outrageous at best&quot; that the wounded men were handcuffed to their hospital beds. &quot;Where are they going?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the men were unshackled as soon as it was discovered they had no weapons on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was supposed to be a special day,&quot; said Bell's father, William. &quot;No one in life should experience this kind of pain. It's not natural. A part of me is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Les Paultre, the father of Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre, told cops: &quot;As you go home to your wives claiming you did your job, I want you to know you killed an innocent man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the fianc&eacute;e's mom, Laura Harper-Paultre, accused cops of killing Bell &quot;in cold blood,&quot; adding, &quot;Cops are very comfortable killing black men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police adamantly denied the shooting was racially motivated, and Kelly said two of the cops who fired are black, two are white and another Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's 22-year-old fianc&eacute;e was at a bridal shower on Long Island when the dad of her two kids was killed. Puffy-eyed, Paultre arrived at the scene of the shooting yesterday morning. &quot;I am the intended bride,&quot; she said before collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was at the strip club with about 20 friends, police sources said. Two undercover cops, looking to make prostitution arrests, were also inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 3 a.m., one of the undercover cops heard a bouncer suggest to a dancer that he had a gun, and the cops went outside to warn plainclothes officers in a nearby van, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hour later, a fight erupted outside the club. Bell, Guzman and Benefield were allegedly among eight men yelling at another man, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the undercover cops heard Bell shout, &quot;Let's f--k him up,&quot; and Guzman say, &quot;Yo - go get my gun,&quot; Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's getting hot on Liverpool, for real, I think there's a gun,&quot; one of the undercovers warned his lieutenant, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One undercover followed the men as they got into Bell's car on Liverpool St. Bell drove forward, brushing that officer before slamming into the unmarked police van as it rounded the corner, Kelly said. It was then that the undercover officer identified himself as a cop and fired the first round, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell threw the car into reverse and slammed into a building, then drove forward into the van again. Plainclothes cops poured from the van. Five officers at the scene began shooting, hitting Bell twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops used dogs to follow a blood trail in search of a fourth man who witnesses said ran from the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two bullets fired during the altercation hit a parked car and another slug flew into a nearby house. A bullet also whizzed by a pair of Port Authority cops standing on an elevated AirTrain platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mom, Valerie, said cops hadn't told her anything about the shooting. &quot;They're covering up, because they know the police did wrong,&quot; she charged. &quot;You know how society works. They label all African-American men the same. They should have pulled out a badge before they started shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE REV. Al Sharpton demanded a &quot;fair and impartial investigation&quot; yesterday into the actions of the cops who shot and killed a young man and wounded two others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton pointed out that there was no immediate evidence that 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his friends were armed, and condemned cops for arresting and handcuffing the wounded men to their hospital beds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to jump to conclusions, but you have to ask yourself: If these guys were not armed, what would cause this amount of bullets to be fired?&quot; he said. &quot;Clearly, someone has to answer these questions.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton consoled Bell's family just as in 2004 when he rallied to the side of 19-year-old Timothy Stansbury's loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stansbury was shot dead Jan. 24, 2004, by Officer Richard Neri when the teen opened a door to the roof of a Brooklyn building, surprising the cop on the other side. A grand jury later voted not to indict Neri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton stopped short of saying that yesterday's shooting was racially motivated, and he did not invoke the name of Stansbury or Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African who was shot dead by four plainclothes Bronx cops in February 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he compared the shooting to the &quot;New Jersey Four.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that 1998 incident, four young men - black and Hispanic - were pulled over for speeding on the New Jersey Turnpike. State troopers shot and wounded three of the men and later said the men had tried to run them down. Sharpton used the incident to focus attention on racial profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In yesterday's shooting, two of the cops who fired are black, two are white and one is Hispanic, the NYPD said. All were on duty in civilian clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After becoming a Democratic presidential contender in 2004 and getting into an international war of words with Mexican President Vicente Fox over perceived racial insensitivity last year, Sharpton yesterday once again found himself in long-familiar New York City territory: a police shooting, black victims and many unanswered questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton learned of the shooting while driving to his National Action Network in Harlem. His cell phone rang about 9:45 a.m., and the caller, a cousin of the man who was killed, said cops had shot three unarmed black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton headed to Jamaica Hospital, where Bell died on his wedding day. On the way, Sharpton called Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott, &quot;to let him know I was very concerned and that I was going to the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's something about this that doesn't smell right,&quot; Sharpton told Walcott, whose office said he went to the shooting scene yesterday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Hall officials refused to say where Mayor Bloomberg was yesterday, but a source said he had been scheduled to play golf in Bermuda. &quot;The mayor was briefed on the incident early this morning, and he and his senior staff have been monitoring the situation all day,&quot; Bloomberg spokesman Matthew Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, another spokesman said the mayor had spoken to Sharpton by phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton met with Bell's family and called back Walcott. He told the deputy mayor that he wanted police &quot;to - as soon as possible - let these families know what is happening here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton then drove to Mary Immaculate Hospital to meet with the wounded men. He pledged to hold a prayer vigil at noon today at the hospital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was his wedding day - not his death day,&quot; said Oniaja Shepherd, 43, whose nephew </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed by police bullets. &quot;We were supposed to go to a wedding. Now we're going to a funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four detectives and one police officer sprayed 50 shots at Bell's car about 4 a.m. after the 23-year-old Queens man twice rammed his vehicle into an unmarked NYPD van, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell - a former high school baseball phenom who had been celebrating his bachelor party at the strip club - was mortally wounded. Two of his friends in the car were shot and rushed to a nearby hospital, police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No weapons were found on Bell or his friends, and no guns were found in their bullet-riddled car near the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our hearts go out to them,&quot; Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of Bell's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the investigation was ongoing. He stopped short of judging the actions of the officers involved as he did in 2004 when he said he believed the shooting of 19-year-old Timothy Stansbury by a Brooklyn cop was unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources said a plainclothes cop at yesterday's scene had identified himself as a cop before the officers fired. But Kelly said no witnesses had confirmed that account and brass had not interviewed the cops, pending a grand jury probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg issued a statement last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it is too early to draw conclusions about this morning's shootings in Jamaica, Queens, we know that the NYPD officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;Commissioner Kelly, Deputy Mayor [Dennis] Walcott and I have been in touch with community leaders throughout the day to hear their concerns and update them on what we know, and we will keep them informed as this investigation continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mayoral spokesman said the community leaders included the Rev. Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's loved ones joined with Sharpton to condemn the cops' actions and demand information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorenzo Kinred, who was at the bachelor's party, said he spoke to one of Bell's wounded pals, Trent Benefield, before he was put into an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police didn't identify who they were,&quot; Benefield said, according to Kinred, 32. &quot;They just pulled guns out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">] saw a guy dressed just like us pulling a gun,&quot; Benefield added, Kinred said. &quot;He just wanted to try and drive away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Jamaica Hospital, where Bell died, Sharpton declared: &quot;Police do not have the right to be the judge, jury and executioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton later visited Joseph Guzman, 31, and Benefield at Mary Immaculate Hospital. Guzman, who was in critical condition, was shot at least 11 times and had 17 entrance or exit wounds on his body. Benefield, who was in stable condition, was shot three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said it was &quot;outrageous at best&quot; that the wounded men were handcuffed to their hospital beds. &quot;Where are they going?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the men were unshackled as soon as it was discovered they had no weapons on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's grieving loved ones were enraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was supposed to be a special day,&quot; said Bell's father, William. &quot;No one in life should experience this kind of pain. It's not natural. A part of me is gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Les Paultre, the father of Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre, told cops: &quot;As you go home to your wives claiming you did your job, I want you to know you killed an innocent man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the fianc&eacute;e's mom, Laura Harper-Paultre, accused cops of killing Bell &quot;in cold blood,&quot; adding, &quot;Cops are very comfortable killing black men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police adamantly denied the shooting was racially motivated, and Kelly said two of the cops who fired are black, two are white and another Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's 22-year-old fianc&eacute;e was at a bridal shower on Long Island when the dad of her two kids was killed. Puffy-eyed, Paultre arrived at the scene of the shooting yesterday morning. &quot;I am the intended bride,&quot; she said before collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was at the strip club with about 20 friends, police sources said. Two plainclothes cops, looking to make prostitution arrests, were also inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 3 a.m., one of the undercover cops heard a bouncer suggest to a dancer that he had a gun, and the cops went outside to warn plainclothes officers in a nearby van, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hour later, a fight erupted outside the club. Bell, Guzman and Benefield were allegedly among eight men yelling at another man, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the undercover cops heard Bell shout, &quot;Let's f--- him up,&quot; and Guzman say, &quot;Yo - go get my gun,&quot; Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's getting hot on Liverpool, for real, I think there's a gun,&quot; the undercover warned his lieutenant, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops followed the men as they got into Bell's car on Liverpool St. Bell drove forward, brushing the plainclothes cop before slamming into the unmarked police van as it rounded the corner, Kelly said. It was then that one of the undercovers identified himself as a cop and fired the first round, the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell threw the car into reverse and slammed into a building, then drove forward into the van again. Plainclothes cops poured from the van and five began shooting, hitting Bell twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops used dogs to follow a blood trail in search of a fourth man who witnesses said ran from the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two bullets fired during the altercation hit a parked car and another slug flew into a nearby house. A bullet also whizzed by a pair of Port Authority cops standing on an elevated AirTrain platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mom, Valerie, said cops hadn't told her anything about the shooting. &quot;They're covering up, because they know the police did wrong,&quot; she charged. &quot;You know how society works. They label all African-American men the same. They should have pulled out a badge before they started shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agendar@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GRAPHIC HOW SHOOTING HAPPENED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Bell pulls his car out of a parking spot on Liverpool Street. He strikes an undercover cop and slams into an unmarked police van. The undercover cop opens fire as Bell backs his car up onto the sidewalk, hitting the building and almost hitting another cop standing on the pavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Bell pulls forward and slams into the police van a second time. Five officers open fire shooting more than 50 rounds, killing Bell and wounding his pals. The cops, including the officer hit by Bell's car, suffer only minor injuries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York authorities were scrambling to contain a backlash this week after police shot a group of three unarmed black men, killing one of them on his wedding day. The shooting took place after a stag party at a strip club in Queens, a few hours before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was due to marry the mother of his two small daughters. He was struck in the neck and arm and was dead on arrival at hospital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of his friends, Joseph Guzman, was in a critical condition after being hit 11 times, and another, Trent Benefield, was in a stable condition with wounds to his leg and buttocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage at the shooting was com pounded when it emerged that Mr Guzman and Mr Benefield had been shackled to their beds. New Yorkers have also been startled at the apparent wildness of the fusillade from a mixed group of police, two white, two black and one Hispanic. The police claim to have heard one of the men mention a gun, but no weapon was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers fired 50 bullets at close range, but fewer than half hit the intended target, a car carrying the three men. The rest sprayed nearby cars and buildings. One shattered a window at a train station, injuring two transport police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting soon became political with the appearance of community leaders, including the Reverend Al Sharpton, the black civil rights leader who has led protests against police brutality - alongside the victims' relatives outside the hospital where the wounded were being treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, urged patience, saying it was too early to draw conclusions. &quot;We know the officers on the scene had reason to believe an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it.&quot; Richard Brown, the borough's district attorney, promised a &quot;full, fair and complete investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials fear a repeat of the Amadou Diallo affair in 1999. Diallo died in a hail of police bullets after reaching for his wallet.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives investigating the fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed 23-year-old black man, arrested four people at a Queens apartment building and seized a loaded semiautomatic handgun and a bag of marijuana, the police said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The arrests were believed to be part of a broad police effort to locate witnesses -- including one described by many in the case as a ''fourth man'' -- who may have briefly been in Mr. Bell's car on Saturday morning in the moments before five police officers fired a fusillade of 50 bullets. Mr. Bell was killed in the gunfire, and his two friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrests did little to cool tensions in an emotionally charged case. One of those arrested, LaToya Smith, said in an interview that she knew Mr. Benefield, who lives in the same complex, as well as Mr. Bell, who she said was helpful to her in the past. Friends and family of the three men said the police were acting overzealously by arresting those who knew the dead and injured men, and noted that all three were victims who have not been charged with any crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They also questioned the existence of the fourth man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If he's bionic, and he's that good to get away from those bullets, I want to meet him, too,'' said Eboni Browning, Mr. Guzman's fiancee, after leaving his bedside at Mary Immaculate Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Investigators have said they are looking for a man in a beige jacket who was seen fleeing the shooting location about 4:15 a.m. on Saturday. The first detective to open fire has said he believed one of the men in the car had a gun. Finding a gun -- or a man who was carrying one -- would corroborate that version and possibly change the dynamics of how prosecutors and the public view the shooting. Officials said they were trying to determine the history of the gun found in the apartment, but that it had not been linked to any of the men in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also last night, law enforcement officials said that they were talking to several people and that one man was taken in for questioning. The Queens district attorney's office said the man's lawyer contacted them and informed them that his client did not want to speak to the police, so he was subsequently released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he had decided not to attend Mr. Bell's funeral, scheduled for today at the Community Church of Christ, in Jamaica, Queens. It is where he was to have married Nicole Paultre on Saturday, the day he died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I've expressed myself, my sympathies on behalf of the city to the family,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, adding that he had asked Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott, who lives in the neighborhood, to represent the city at the funeral. Mr. Bloomberg said that he and his aides had spoken to the family and their minister on Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police officials said that two search warrants were executed early on Wednesday at apartments at 123-65 147th Street, leading to the arrests of Stanley Smith, 23, Ms. Smith, 26, Timothy Smith, 19, and Christopher Keyes, 18, on charges of criminal possession of a weapon. Those warrants were part of a continuing narcotics investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday, Ms. Smith was back home describing how detectives ''broke down our door'' with their guns drawn at 6 a.m. on Wednesday and took her and her brothers and their friend in for questioning. Ms. Smith said the police ''had to let me go,'' without charging her. But bail was set at $2,000 each for her brothers and at $1,000 for Mr. Keyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A criminal complaint against Stanley and Timothy Smith and Mr. Keyes said that a loaded, black Smith &amp; Wesson 9-millimeter semiautomatic was found in a bedroom closet and that the weapon's serial number had been scratched off. One of those charged had a bag of marijuana, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday that the warrant that led to the arrests was executed ''in conjunction'' with the investigation of the shooting of Mr. Bell. ''The warrant execution took place as a result of previous purchases of narcotics at that location,'' where the raid took place, he said at a news conference at 1 Police Plaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But people at the apartment complex in Queens, where candles and photos were set up in tribute to Mr. Bell, said they were outraged by the police behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the mood was the same at Mary Immaculate Hospital, where Mr. Benefield and Mr. Guzman were recuperating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm enraged,'' said Bishop Erskine Williams, who said that his 26-year-old son, Erskine Williams Jr., was arrested yesterday on a warrant for an unpaid summons of $25. He was soon released. ''They're harassing a lot of male blacks where we live, and it's got to stop,'' the bishop said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the bishop, who said he was in a group of people who met with Mayor Bloomberg on Monday, his son, who knows Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield, was questioned by the police about Mr. Bell's bachelor party, whether he was there, and what those involved might have told him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's obvious the police need to build a case,'' said the bishop, who is the pastor of New Seasons Family Worship Center in Jamaica. He said the Smiths are his niece and nephews and that Stanley Smith is the keyboard player at his church. ''They don't have credible evidence. Their methods are wrong, even if their intentions may be pure.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview, his son said that after he spent a night in the hospital watching over Mr. Benefield, detectives checked him for tattoos and pressed him for details about what Mr. Benefield had said. ''They know I'm Trent's best friend,'' said the younger Mr. Erskine. ''That's why they're harassing me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others at the complex where the arrests took place, the Baisley Park Gardens, said the police were asking about a man nicknamed Ducky. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly declined to speak about any incremental developments in the police investigation. He said there was nothing he could do about the skepticism about the existence of a fourth man. ''The existence of a fourth person is a part of this investigation,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''It's one of the issues being addressed by investigators.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police efforts are being led by the same unit of the Internal Affairs Bureau that spearheaded the inquiry into the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, seven years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Borrowing a tactic used by politicians, Mr. Kelly, as he has in the past, said yesterday that he has impaneled a committee to review all the policies and procedures governing the activities of undercover officers throughout the department.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, some attention turned this week to cops who lost life, not cops who took life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The city's focus, understandably, has been on the police fusillade in Queens that killed an unarmed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on what was to have been his wedding day. This tale is New York gothic at its most refined, a conflation of race, politics, undercover police methods and lethal force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But meanwhile, in Brooklyn, some attention turned to cops who lost life, not cops who took life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is happening in a federal courtroom where a Staten Island man with an expressionless face is on trial for his life, charged with shooting two undercover police detectives in the back of the head. He in effect executed them, it is charged, for the effrontery of trying to rid the streets of illegal guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These two events would seem unrelated. But they are two faces of the same New York story. Both involve police undercover work that went disastrously wrong, although in different ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The very nature of this work can lead to nightmarish situations because, by definition, undercover officers are supposed to melt into their surroundings. Snap decisions -- when to back off, when to make arrests, certainly when to shoot -- are rarely uncomplicated or without peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the case before the Brooklyn jury, the murdered detectives pretended one night in March 2003 that they were interested in buying a gun. As part of this pretense, according to the charges, they sat up front in a car, acting as if they had a bond with two men in the back seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This was a mistake. It allowed one of the men in the back to fire at them, point-blank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They paid with their lives, Detectives James V. Nemorin, 36, and Rodney J. Andrews, 34 -- they with five children between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much about the Queens shooting last Saturday remains unclear. But from details that have emerged, it seems that in this case, as well, the decisions to be made were hard and dangerous, and they produced horrible consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the undercover police officers, by his account, feared that several young men who had just left a strip club either had a gun or were about to get one. He drew his weapon and fired on their car, touching off a 50-round barrage from him and other officers on his undercover team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This, too, it would seem, was a mistake, but someone else paid with his life: Mr. Bell, who was 23 and had two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In such shootings, race almost always figures in the equation -- what role did it play, what does it say about a city where everything is not necessarily black and white. That is especially so in these two cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All the victims were black men: Mr. Bell and the two detectives. The man accused of murdering the police officers, Ronell Wilson, is also black. So are seven other men who were charged in that killing. So, too, is the undercover officer who opened fire last Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Looked at this way, the issue is not really about race, some may say. Mr. Bell's father, William Bell, said as much the other day. It is not so much about color, he said, as about the police and their sense of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But one would have to be willfully blind not to notice that so often when there is a questionable police killing of an unarmed New Yorker, the victim is a black man. Randolph Evans, Nathaniel Gaines Jr., Amadou Diallo, Ousmane Zongo, Timothy Stansbury Jr. and now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the depressing roll call could go on and on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Almost inevitably, outrage builds after each episode, along with demands for altered police practices. This week, the reaction has been relatively muted compared with previous situations. Nonetheless, the chorus of protest has many voices, and it may swell further today with a funeral service for Mr. Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MEANWHILE, in Brooklyn, attention also turned to cops who lost life, not cops who took life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This trial reinforces another reality, namely that the sorts of police undercover operations that sometimes kill black men also help keep black men alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The type of highly dangerous work performed by Detectives Nemorin and Andrews has led to the confiscation of thousands of illicit guns. Disproportionately, black neighborhoods are the targets of such operations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But then, also disproportionately, black men are the ones killed by these weapons. It is why police sting operations are carried out more often in black neighborhoods than in white precincts like Park Avenue, where crime is more typically waged with pens, not guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The risky work is not flawless. It frequently leads to innocent young black men believing they are singled out and stopped by the police merely because of the way they look or dress. Tensions usually remain beneath the surface, if barely, until something goes awry, as it did in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Somehow, the outrage is not usually as great when the victim is a police officer. Perhaps that is because risk is part of the job, perhaps because the police are held to higher standards than street criminals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even so, when the victims are cops, like Detectives Nemorin and Andrews, anger has a way of subsiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday, Day 4 of Mr. Wilson's trial in Federal District Court, relatively few people showed up to hear testimony about how the accused man supposedly got hold of the gun that he used. A bench reserved for the general public was only half-filled for most of the afternoon session. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the streets outside the courthouse, there were no protesters, no cries for justice, no anger, no weeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even so, in a week dominated by the appalling death of an unarmed man, it was notable that meanwhile, in Brooklyn, some attention turned to cops who lost life, not cops who took life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FIRST thing Monday morning, Richard A. Brown, the bulldog-ish Queens district attorney conducting the grand jury investigation of Saturday's fatal, predawn confrontation between a multiracial squad of undercover officers and a carload of black men out on the town for a bachelor party, convened his senior staff at his Queens Boulevard headquarters. The mood was tense. Still is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What he and his prosecutorial team had to parse: a 50-shot barrage of bullets from five officers that killed the prospective bridegroom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> put two of his friends in the hospital, mobilized minority activists like the Rev. Al Sharpton and prompted Michael R. Bloomberg, the city's perturbed mayor, to call the shooting ''unacceptable'' and ''inexplicable.'' Opinionated words from Mr. Mayor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is up to Mr. Brown to do the unopinionated explaining: ''I don't see this as being a hate crime or a racially motivated crime in any sense,'' he says. ''It's a no-brainer that it's the kind of incident that cries out for an investigation by a grand jury, not that I'm afraid of making factual decisions on my own.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The requisite accumulation and extrapolation of the facts promise to be a fraught process. No shirkers allowed. Not with a boss who, when the report of the shooting came in over his personal ''hot line'' at 5 a.m., was wide awake at his weekend house in Litchfield County, scanning the Internet to stay ahead of the curve. On his watch, he has overseen nearly a million cases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown, 74, whose unusual physique -- quite short, quite stout, quite robust -- belies a sizable ambition and ego intent on compiling a civic legacy that survives any and all smirches, had an aide record his words at the Monday meeting. Then he had his comments printed out. For the record, posterity or future reference? A bit of each. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the same procedure on Monday evening when Mr. Sharpton brought Mr. Bell's grief-racked relatives by and Mr. Brown explained the investigation process. He urged Mr. Sharpton ''to tone down the level of rhetoric'' lest the case take on the hysteria that accompanied the trial of the four officers who fatally shot Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Guinean immigrant. ''I just don't want to see us fall into a trap where the rhetoric so prejudices the case that a fair trial cannot be provided for, if indeed it reaches that point.'' Mr. Brown said he sensed that Mr. Sharpton left the meeting ''confident that I'd go where the evidence led me, and that's certainly my intention.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AFTER two decades as a judge, he prides himself on operating, yes, judiciously. Two months into that job in 1973, he made front page tabloid news and gained a nickname, Duck Down Brown, when a pistol-packing defendant opened fire in his courtroom at 100 Centre Street and he saved himself by diving beneath his desk, robe and all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown, who grew up in Cambria Heights, lives in Forest Hills, and presided over the 1977 arraignment of the ''Son of Sam'' serial killer, David Berkowitz, left the Appellate Division in 1991 when Gov, Mario M. Cuomo appointed him Queens district attorney. ''I think I did it a better way,'' he says of his unorthodox trajectory. ''I'm not using this as a steppingstone to get to the bench: been there, done that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, judicious is his favorite self-descriptor. He retains the honorific -- colleagues address him as ''Judge'' -- 15 years into his reign as district attorney, a position he intends to hold for at least another four-year term in order to claim the title of longest-tenured district attorney in Queens County. Retirement is out, he says. ''I don't look forward to sitting around and twiddling my thumbs.'' Weekend tennis matches (he's a fanatic) and visits with his two grandchildren help him unwind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the recent 50th reunion of his New York University Law School class, he crabbily commented to his wife, Rhoda, that the rest of the alums looked ancient. ''She said, 'Have you looked at yourself lately?' '' He has, and he's fine with it. About a lifetime of being shorter than the next guy, he shrugs: ''As long as I can see my wife eye-to-eye, I'm O.K.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown, flashing a diamond pinkie ring inherited from his dad, a real estate developer, and occupying a hobnail leather chair that fits like a throne, dives straight into Monday's notes when asked, in a lengthy chat made lengthier by his halting speech -- his authoritative croaking is lubricated with morning coffees and Diet Coke in the afternoon -- if he is worried about this investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Might it turn out to be a career-breaker rather than a career-maker? ''Quite frankly, I think my career has already been defined,'' he says. Then he appropriates the question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What you're suggesting is 'You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't,' but I'm not here because it's a cushy job,'' he says, realigning his red tie on his shirtfront. ''I'm here because I want to do the right thing. This is what I told my own staff,'' he adds, shuffling his notes and reading, verbatim, from the comments he made at his Monday meeting. ''It's the kind of story that defines our tenure,'' he said of the Bell shooting, reminding his staff that the office has the respect of the police as well as the confidence of Queens County residents and he isn't keen on forfeiting either. ''I want to be certain that we come out of this investigation with that reputation intact.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On that note, Mr. Brown produces a sheaf of flattering statements from Mr. Bloomberg. ''You don't mind if I pat myself on the back, do you?'' he asks.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maliki and President Bush promised little and delivered less, and reaffirmed a widespread loss of faith in the elected government's ability to turn things around.  A18<BR><BR>Child Sex Abuse in Africa<BR>Even as sub-Saharan Africa races to adopt many of the developed world's norms for children, child sexual abuse remains a stubbornly persistent problem. In much of the continent, child advocates say, perpetrators are shielded by the traditionally low status of girls and a lingering view that sexual abuse should be dealt with privately.  A1<BR><BR>Lower Cost of AIDS Drugs<BR>With the financial backing of a group of nations led by France, former President Bill Clinton announced that his foundation had negotiated deeply reduced prices for 19 AIDS drugs to treat children in 62 developing countries. The initiative halved the cost of the simplest-to-use therapy to less than $60 a year for each child.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''Bloomberg Calls 50 Shots by the Police 'Unacceptable' '' (front page, Nov. 28):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bloomberg administration's decision to move away from the past City Hall practice of reflexively defending police shootings is commendable. Knee-jerk defenses of police shootings, no matter what the circumstances, became an art form under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those reactions gravely damaged the city's relations with its minority communities and undermined the idea that the police could be investigated fairly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has swung too far in the other direction. His snap condemnation of the police in the heated aftermath of Saturday morning's fatal shooting by officers in Queens is wrong for the same reasons the previous administration was wrong to immediately defend the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though by any account </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death is tragic, the facts are not yet in, and no one knows exactly what happened or who, if anyone, is to blame. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mayor should stand up for justice, and let a thorough investigation take its course.<BR><BR>Josh Hafetz<BR>New Haven, Nov. 28, 2006<BR><BR>The writer is a former investigator for the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board.<BR><BR>To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''Badges, Guns and Another Unarmed Victim,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Nov. 30):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York's Finest are supposed to be heroes. They are heroes because they are expected to put their lives before the lives of the civilians they are here to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly should carry out a ''do not shoot until fired upon'' policy. No police officer should open fire before being fired upon unless there is clear danger and rock-solid justification for firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Everyone mourns when an officer falls in the line of duty. Police officers deserve all our respect for the sacrifice they are prepared to make for us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The word ''hero'' gets passed around too easily these days. It should mean something. <BR><BR>Taylor Samuels<BR>Brooklyn, Nov. 30, 2006</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When family members and friends of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> come together at a humble Baptist church on 108th Avenue in Queens on the evening of December 1 to mourn his death, neither the mayor nor the police commissioner will be in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Raymond Kelly announced yesterday that a committee of ranking police officials would review procedures for undercover operations at the New York Police Department, after police fired 50 shots at the car Bell was driving. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott, the senior black member of Mayor Bloomberg's administration, will represent the city at the funeral. Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that after speaking with Bishop Lester Williams on Tuesday, he decided not to attend the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Williams was scheduled to preside over Bell's wedding last Saturday, but after the shooting, he will now administer the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all of us, our hearts go out to the parents and to the fiancee and his two children,&quot; the bishop said at P.S. 21 in the Bronx. &quot;It's very, very sad. When you look parents in the eye, and they are coming to grips with the fact that their son is not going to come home, it is a very difficult thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of Bell, 23, Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23, has led several community and religious leaders to accuse the police department of systematic racism and violence against young, black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor and other officials have said the event was an isolated incident in which police seemed to have used &quot;excessive&quot; force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new committee will be led by the police official in charge of the department's Internal Affairs Bureau, Chief Charles Campisi. It will look into recruitment, selection, training, and operations of units that use undercover officers, Mr. Kelly said. The deputy commissioner of public safety for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, Cedric Alexander, will be a part of the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the hour of the funeral neared, the mother of another man shot and killed by police lit a candle in Bell's memory outside the Kalua Cabaret. The three men who were shot were trailed from the club by an undercover detective who believed they had a gun, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I came here today to give my condolences,&quot; Phyllis Clayborne-Watson, whose son Timothy Stansbury was shot on the roof of a Brooklyn housing project by a police officer on January 24, 2004, said. He was shot after he opened a door to a roof, startling an officer patrolling the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm feeling her pain,&quot; she said of Bell's mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking for the first time about the shooting, the president of Queens, Helen Marshall, joined the chorus of officials calling the shooting &quot;excessive.&quot; Ms. Marshall was in Los Angeles when the shooting happened, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police yesterday continued their search for the &quot;fourth man,&quot; a missing link that police say may have been carrying a gun but fled Liverpool Street before the shooting began. Two witnesses have said they saw a man wearing a beige jacket run away just before the police opened fire when Bell drove his car into the undercover officer and a minivan with two police officers inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four people were arrested &quot;in relation to&quot; the investigation of the events surrounding Bell's death on Wednesday morning, Mr. Kelly said, but he refused to provide details of their relation to Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanley Smith, 23, Latoya Smith, 26, Timothy Smith, 19, and Christopher Keyes, 18, were arrested and charged by police with criminal possession of a weapon in the 2nd and 3rd degrees. Police said a bag of marijuana was also found. A Smith and Wesson 9mm pistol with its serial number filed off was found in Stanley Smith's bedroom closet, according to the criminal complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queens district attorney's office, which is investigating the five officers involved with Bell's shooting, declined to prosecute Ms. Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents of the building where the four people live said Bell was known to spend time there, but they denied the existence of a &quot;fourth man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They broke down my door,&quot; Ms. Smith, who said she knew Bell, said. &quot;I was scared. I didn't know what was going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have been coming to the building and asking questions since the shooting, residents said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of people gathered near another makeshift memorial to Bell inside the building. Near a collection of candles and photographs, a graffiti artist, who identified himself only as Lee, painted Bell's likeness on different pieces of clothing. Using electric blues and pinks, he penned the inscription &quot;Always Missed But Never Forgotten&quot; on a T-shirt that he sold for $35. The hood of one young woman's sweatshirt read &quot;R.I.P.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever would we do if we didn't have the Reverend Al Sharpton telling us what we need to get excited about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the tragic shooting by the police of an unarmed man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the morning of his wedding, Rev. Sharpton coordinated a protest demanding answers from the NYPD. When well-known public figures show up at events that have barely resonated in our consciences, facts tend to get pushed aside and replaced by emotional frenzies that can spiral out of control. If anyone knows the consequences of this, it should be Rev. Sharpton. Remember Freddy's?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, a black-controlled Harlem landlord, the United House of Prayer, raised the rent on Freddy's Fashion Mart; the store's Jewish owner then raised the rent on his subtenant, a black-owned music store. Rev. Sharpton's National Action Network set up picket lines and harassed shoppers entering Freddy's, calling them &quot;Uncle Toms&quot; and &quot;traitors.&quot; Protesters shouted, &quot;Burn down the Jew store.&quot; On December 8, one of the protesters entered the store and shot four employees, then set the store on fire. Seven employees died in the fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton was also instrumental in inciting the riots that took place in 1991 in Crown Heights when he spoke at the funeral of Gavin Cato, the 7-year-old accidentally killed by a chasidic driver. He ranted against the &quot;diamond merchants with the blood of innocent babies on their hands.&quot; During a march by hundreds of demonstrators through the Jewish neighborhood, a rabbinical student, Yankel Rosenbaum, was stabbed to death by a member of a mob that was shouting: &quot;Kill the Jews.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who can forget the Tawana Brawley hoax?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine my surprise when I read an editorial at Townhall.com proclaiming: &quot;Sharpton's Stature Rises to New Heights.&quot; This time out, Rev. Sharpton is being reasonable and calling for calm rather than angrily inciting racial free-for-alls. He has even managed to enlist Mayor Bloomberg. Sadly, the mayor has made a very grievous error in prejudging the incident, coming down against the NYPD unit involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've known that Rev. Sharpton was a smart man ever since he appeared on Bill Maher's &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; when it actually was. I'm also aware he has hinted that he may run for president in 2008, and so find understandable his toned down, pseudo-respectable demeanor. What I cannot understand is how his shameful past and blatantly demagogic behavior could have been forgotten so easily by those now praising his reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I truly believe in redemption healing the soul, but as far as I know, Rev. Sharpton has never apologized for the crimes he's committed against a civil society. He certainly has never apologized to Steven Pagones, a young prosecutor he singled out as the perpetrator of a crime that never happened -the rape, abduction, and smearing with feces of 15-year old Tawana Brawley. Although Mr. Pagones sued Rev. Sharpton and won $345,000 verdict for defamation, he's still waiting for the reverend to admit his role in this disgraceful affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing Rev. Sharpton is doing right, for whatever reason, is calling for answers to the events that occurred in Queens last week. While I do not believe Commissioner Raymond Kelly should be removed because of what may have been excessive action by the police squad, I do think he needs to admit that not all the cops in the NYPD are superheroes. Some of them are complete bozos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure whether it was the ACLU or NOW that was responsible for lowering the NYPD's hiring standards, but whenever I see a certain female police officer at the ferry terminal who is shorter and rounder than I am, I can't help but think - &quot;Hey, even I could take her gun.&quot; One of the recruits coming out of the Police Academy prompted a homeless vagrant to shout: &quot;Did you see that itty-bitty thing? She's off to see the wizard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that some cops do not always identify themselves as such. My son was stopped in St. George on his way home by men in plainclothes in an unmarked vehicle who demanded to know where he was going. My son asked: &quot;Who are you? Why should I tell you?&quot; A cop then jumped out of the car with his hand on his gun and came up behind him. It was only after my son told him he lived in the building that the police officer reached inside his shirt and pull out his ID badge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time to stop pretending we have elite police units. Elite policemen don't make headlines. They know when to use their guns and they know how to hit a target without emptying their firearm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shakeup is definitely needed, but what a shame it takes someone like Al Sharpton to make that point.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police arrested four people Wednesday at the Baisley Gardens project inSouth Jamaica and picked up at least three others on outstanding warrantsyesterday. The men were pressed to help identify the man who supposedlybolted from the scene in South Jamaica before police unloaded 50 shots,killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, and wounding two pals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three of the shot men were unarmed, although the cops have said theythought someone in the car had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The target of the police search yesterday was a man the officers at thescene and other witnesses said ran from the car as the shooting began, andpossibly dumped a gun. Investigators know his nickname is Mo, and believehe lives in or around the Baisley houses, a law-enforcement source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those swept up in the raids and later let go by police told The Post thatofficers repeatedly asked if they knew Mo, and what the word on the streetwas. In one case, a man was asked what one of the victims had told himafter the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They questioned me about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They asked me about many differentnames. They asked, 'Do you know these people?' 'Is anybody talking?' 'Whatare you hearing?' &quot; said Latoya Smith, 26, who was picked up with her twobrothers and a friend when police executed a search warrant on theirsecond-floor apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt like I was being harassed. I was scared to death,&quot; she said.&quot;There was a search warrant. They never said what it was. They had nocharges on me. They had nothing on me. They had to let me go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police held her two brothers, Stanley Smith, 23, and Timothy Smith,19, and their pal, Christopher Keys 18, on a gun charge. Officers found aloaded Smith &amp; Wesson 9 mm handgun with its serial number filed off in ashoebox in a closet. There was no indication that the 9 mm is themysterious gun the cops are looking for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raids left the project shaken and angered its residents - one ofwhom, Trent Benefield, 23, was a victim of the police fusillade in front ofthe Kalua Cabaret strip club early Saturday morning. Bell had gone therewith friends to celebrate his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those swept up in the raids was Benefield's close friend ErskineWilliams Jr., whose father, Bishop Erskine Williams Sr., has been servingas the Benefield family spokesman. The younger Williams said cops nabbedhim at 6 a.m. on an old $25 ticket for loitering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once cops brought him to the 103rd Precinct station house, they nevermentioned the ticket again and demanded to know what Benefield had saidabout the night of the shooting, he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They asked me what did me and Trent talk about. 'People in the streetsare saying Trent told you everything.' He didn't tell me the story,&quot; hesaid. &quot;They know I'm Trent's best friend; that's why they are harassingme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elder Williams said Benefield was distressed to hear that his friendswere being caught up in what he believes is a heavy-handed police effort tocover for their officers' excessive actions at the club.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said &quot;there is an ongoinginvestigation led by the Internal Affairs Bureau and any informationobtained is turned over to the District Attorney's Office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell had gone to the strip club with pals Benefield and Joseph Guzman onFriday night to celebrate his wedding the following day. The club was beingmonitored for prostitution by undercover cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point - not long before closing - an undercover officer inside theclub spotted a man dressed in black who he believed was carrying a gun. Hecalled his supervisor, who was in an unmarked car with other plainclothescops outside, and reported that the man may have had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, as the club closed, the undercover officer saw the man getinto an argument with Bell and his friends. The officer heard Guzman yell,&quot;Yo, get my gun!&quot; as his friends walked back to their car. The cop thendecided to break cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He charged toward the car with his gun drawn and badge displayed, butBell slammed on the gas pedal, striking the cop. The officer opened fire,which prompted his backup to fire as well as they rushed in to help.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVER since he was a kid, this cop dreamed of joining the NYPD. Now, aburning building looks more inviting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever we do, we're damned,&quot; said the officer, who plans to apply tothe Fire Department.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this critical moment in our city's history, when we need firmleadership and a level head, our clueless mayor has chosen to act like arank amateur. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's handed the reins of this city to the likes of Al Sharpton and JesseJackson, the dilettante civil-rights leader who parachutes in whenever aHollywood star utters a racial slur or a New York City cop shoots his gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the spell of these men, Mayor Bloomberg has already declared thatthe fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - still under investigation and withmany questions unanswered - was no mistake. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's chief executive has all but declared it a crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Excessive,&quot; Bloomberg termed the episode, a word that echoed from 1Police Plaza to your local precinct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no evidence that they [Bell and friends] were doing anythingwrong,&quot; he also said - implying that all evidence has already beencollected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then, the city's de facto commander-in-chief - the man the policecommissioner and all cops answer to - said his remarks were those of a&quot;civilian.&quot; What? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, an energized Mayor Sharpton is ramping up the rhetoric. He declared,&quot;We will be shopping for justice while people go shopping for theholidays!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These cops don't stand a chance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragic death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the eve of his wedding, absolutelydeserves a thorough review. Among the questions that should be answered inthe coming days is - why were 50 shots fired at the car he was driving? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports so far suggest the cops had reason to fear for their lives -rightly or wrongly. Maybe they panicked. Or perhaps their fear wasjustified. This is why we have investigations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to call it a crime is premature at best. And reckless at worst. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We go out there every day and we make a difference,&quot; another city copsaid to me. His stress was evident - this man should not have to protest somuch. Deep in their hearts, Sharpton and Bloomberg know it is true. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson in charge, the truth doesn't standa chance. And neither does this city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a contrast to the scene in Brooklyn Federal Court, where one RonellWilson is on trial in the 2003 murders of NYPD Detectives James Nemorin andRodney Andrews. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Al Sharpton there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Charles Barron. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Jesse Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two detectives had been working undercover to break up a gun-runninggang operating out of a Staten Island housing project. Then a gun-buy wentdisastrously bad, their cover blown - and they were shot dead on the spot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nemorin and Andrews, as it happened, were black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They died heroes in an effort to keep illegal guns out of a virtuallyall-black Staten Island housing project. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is to say, to save black lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nemorin left a wife and three children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews, a wife and two kids. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their families grieved no less than the survivors of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But without Sharpton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without Barron. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No visit paid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a word of condolence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor has any of the three attended the Wilson trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not surprising, for two reasons: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To do so would show a modicum of derivative respect for the NYPD. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* And there are no media cameras in that particular courtroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what would be the point? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton and Barron and Jackson care only about certain dead blackpeople. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They care only about tragedies that present opportunities to sow rancor,and to advance their personal agendas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not news, of course, but it is worth pointing out that thefatherless children of hero cops need a hug, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Sharpton or Barron or Jackson gives a damn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of 10 brothers and sisters, University of Miami coach Frank Haith is uncle to &quot;a lot of nephews and nieces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the son of Haith's older brother, William, always stood out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You see all the pictures of him and he does look just like me,&quot; Haith said Thursday. &quot;We had a special bond because of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That bond was broken early Saturday morning when Bell, 23, was shot and killed in the New York borough of Queens after undercover officers opened fire on his car. A hail of bullets hit Bell and two passengers, who both survived. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has brought nationwide attention, and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has aksed for a Justice Department investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who was unarmed, was killed after attending his own bachelor party and hours before he was scheduled to marry the mother of his two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith said Bell was planning to go into the music business and was beginning to make plans for his future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the process, he really just came to his senses and he decided to get married, which was a positive,&quot; Haith said. &quot;Everybody was so happy for him that he made that decision. He was getting ready to start a new chapter in his life. That's why it's sad, because we felt Sean had really figured out what he wanted to do with his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith said he received a phone call early Saturday from his sister, who told him of the shooting. Haith attended the Hurricanes' shoot-around that morning and coached UM to a 98-66 rout of Lafayette at the BankUnited Center on Saturday night before informing his staff, as well as Athletic Director Paul Dee and UM President Donna Shalala, about the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith waited until after Tuesday's loss at Northwestern before he talked to UM players about his nephew's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been hard, but we're one family,&quot; guard Jack McClinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all feel his pain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith said Bell was a frequent visitor to his home. Last summer, Bell spent a couple of days with the coach and his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith said Bell was a &quot;really good baseball player&quot; who had a chance to play in college but chose not to. Bell considered going to junior college, then began talking about a music career during a summer visit to his uncle's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a great kid, but he was one of those guys that wanted to do a little bit of everything,&quot; Haith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When told recently that Bell was getting married, Haith said he called his brother and asked, &quot;Why is he getting married so soon? I mean it's November and I can't come. I have a game that day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Bell, Sean's father, responded by saying: &quot;That's what Sean wanted. He just wanted to get married right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he was angry at the circumstances surrounding his nephew's death, Haith said: &quot;No, I'm not angry. I'm strong in my faith. Things like this, you put in God's hands and you know things happen for a reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith was scheduled to fly Thursday night to New York and will attend Bell's funeral today. He expects to return to Miami tonight and begin preparations for Sunday's home ACC opener against Georgia Tech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith said that coaching has provided a welcome relief during what has been &quot;a tough week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basketball has been very good for me,&quot; Haith said. &quot;It's been soothing for me to stay involved -- with our team and being with my staff and having people around.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alfred Lubrano: Racism's modern complexion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savvy enough, white Americans know how to answer poll questions about race:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c27">We are the world; Some of my best friends are...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thing is, it's baloney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While 20 percent of whites will admit to being biased against blacks, the real figure is closer to 80 percent, scientific psychologists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I mention this amid the brutality and sonic barbarity of the last couple of weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undercover New York cops took the time to fire, reload, then continue shooting 50 bullets at a car that contained black men but no guns. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was to marry within hours of the fusillade, was killed. Cops say the car hit an officer, but city police protocol states that is not reason enough to open fire when no one is shooting back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident triggered memories of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African man killed in a hail of 41 shots by the same police department in 1999. Not to mention Abner Louima, a Haitian New Yorker violated with a plunger in a cop toilet in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And recently, comedian Michael Richards vilely spewed the n-word at hecklers in a comedy club like an onstage sniper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we don't have access to the heads of cops and comedians, it's a good bet these particular ones spark with flashes of real hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many white folks don't hate. But most have biases, even though they don't think they do. And therein lies a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We no longer lynch; 21st-century racism is &quot;racism among the well-intentioned,&quot; according to John Dovidio, a scientific psychologist at the University of Connecticut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people who won't normally express racism will, when they believe it's justified, or when they feel pressure, act in a racist manner, Dovidio says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most white people grew up in a society in which more black than white faces were associated with poverty and crime on the TV news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They grew up hearing negative comments about blacks from their parents; didn't see black people in their homes; never knew a black person with power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What gets ingrained is that blacks are not as good as whites. You learn that it's wrong to say out loud, but it slithers in the lizard brain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's modern racism,&quot; Dovidio says. &quot;A person can be nice 90 percent of the time, but capable of racism the other 10.&quot; If you're white and get cut off by a black driver, for example, do awful words barge into your head?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racism can be measured. In a test too complex to explain (see it at www.implicit.harvard.edu), scientists can tease out subconscious race bias that pollsters don't reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, race bias is expressed as in-group preference rather than as overt hostility. You'd rather be with your own kind, and at work, promote your own kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why affirmative-action laws are vital: Your subconscious is telling you to give the job to the white person because you're just more comfortable with that color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even whites who say they're &quot;colorblind&quot; explain to scientists that that means they blanch African Americans into Caucasians in their minds to make them seem OK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way to battle bias is to live integrated lives. Truly unprejudiced people had countless positive interracial experiences, particularly as kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meantime, just because you don't say the n-word doesn't mean you've fixed the problem. Bias lives in all of us. And we can't let our good intentions deceive us into thinking we're handling race well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday morning, Al Sharpton was photographed alongside Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly during a news conference at New York's City Hall. The tableau of men and women  --  almost all in dark suits  --  was in response to a shooting that had occurred over the weekend. Twenty-three-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed African American man, was shot and killed by undercover police officers hours before his wedding. In a car with two male friends, he was leaving a nightclub after his bachelor party. He died in a barrage of gunfire. The other men, also unarmed, were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mayor stood behind a  lectern offering his assessment of the shooting, answering questions and attempting to quell community outrage over a death that some, including Sharpton, saw as part of a pattern of overzealous city cops gunning down unarmed black men.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The activist preacher is often seen leading marches, stirring up grass-roots protests and decrying the establishment. But it was impossible to miss Sharpton at Bloomberg's side. The mayor was in the standard dark business suit. Sharpton was wearing a three-piece, caramel-color windowpane-checked suit . . . with a matching striped tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His hair was brushed back in its usual homage to James Brown. Although over the years, the 52-year-old Sharpton has become more conservative in both dress and grooming. He no longer wears rap star track suits. And his signature hairdo lost much of its dramatic bouffant-icity during his 2004 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reverend stood out not so much because of his locks, but because of his suit. Its tailoring was straightforward, but against a backdrop of so many sober suits, it might as well have been yellow. The trousers were full and fluid and puddled generously at Sharpton's ankles. The matching vest was striking because so few men still wear them. Occasionally one sees someone sporting a tweed waistcoat with a suit  --  a style that suggests he is a country gentleman and a bit of a dandy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the vest worn by Sharpton was reminiscent of old-fashioned decorum,  leavened with a bit of swagger. It is both formal and fly. It calls to mind the attire of certain men of the cloth, who see themselves as preachers who deliver the Word more than theologians who parse it. The vest reads like a statement of exaggerated dignity and pulpit-pounding righteousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For his photo opportunity with the suits of City Hall, Sharpton dressed in the expected tailored attire, but he made sure that he would not be seen as part of the establishment. He was a little too flashy, a tad too loud. He positioned himself as a peacock of moral clarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two days later, Sharpton accompanied the deceased bridegroom's fiancee to the scene of the shooting. He was dressed in a dark suit with subtle pinstripes. Certainly, it was a more somber occasion and his attire conveyed that. But Sharpton's dark jacket and pants also delivered the message that he was The Man in charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The difference between a dark suit and one the color of butterscotch has as much to do with formality and tradition as with rebellion. A man's dark suit is the surest way to convey propriety. It acknowledges the accepted code of conduct and gives a nod to the status quo. It can be a sign of appeasement or serve as bespoke camouflage. Wearing a dark suit doesn't mean that a man plans to kowtow to the establishment, but it suggests he plans on playing the social, economic or political game as it exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sharpton's butterscotch-colored suit was almost a visual taunt, a signal to onlookers that his presence should not be construed as an indication that he has become part of the team  --  despite the group portrait. He has agreed to play by the rules, but do not underestimate him as an adversary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: The police officer who fired the opening salvo in a 50-shot barrage that felled a Queens man on his wedding day has told his story for the first time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective insisted he identified himself as a cop long before he fired on the car carrying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his friends on Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This cop screamed, 'police' and had his shield out,'' attorney Philip Karasyk said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective held his fire despite Mr Bell clipping him with his car, Mr Karasyk said of his unidentified client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four other officers also opened fire on the car, Mr Karasyk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the gunfire was over, Bell was dead and two passengers were badly wounded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time it was 50 shots from five officers. With Amadou Diallo it was 41 shots from four officers. With Eleanor Bumpurs, an aging, overweight, disoriented grandmother, it was a pair of shotgun blasts from a single officer -- inside her apartment!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decades pass. The stories remain the same. Nathaniel Gaines Jr., a 25-year-old Navy veteran, was shot to death by a cop on a subway platform in the Bronx on the Fourth of July in 1996. The mayor at the time, Rudolph Giuliani, no softy on crime, said of the shooting: ''There does not seem to be any reason for it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On an April morning in 1973 a veteran cop named Thomas Shea pulled his service revolver and blew away a black kid on a street in Jamaica, Queens. There was no reason on God's glittering earth for that killing. The kid, Clifford Glover, was 10 years old. The cop shot him in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thanksgiving Day in 1976 an officer named Robert Torsney fired a bullet into the head of Randolph Evans, 15, outside a housing project in Brooklyn. No one could explain that killing, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday, under an overcast sky and with a crush of reporters around them, the relatives and fiancee of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> visited the narrow street in Queens where he was killed in a sudden frantic fusillade of police bullets early last Saturday morning, just a few hours before he was to be married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell and two friends who had attended his bachelor party at a nearby club were in his car when they were set upon by a group of undercover cops who had been staking out the club. The two friends were seriously wounded in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here is my first quick take on this case: If I was in my car outside a rowdy nightclub in the wee hours of the morning and someone who looked like a club patron came running toward me, screaming and waving a gun, I would immediately slam the gearshift into drive, hit the accelerator and try to get the hell out of there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This appears to be what happened. The cops, dressed to blend in with the club crowd, were single-mindedly looking for trouble -- evidence of prostitution, underage drinking, illegal guns, and so forth. They were looking so hard for criminal behavior that they seem to have imagined it where none was occurring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One officer is said to have believed that one of Mr. Bell's companions may have had a gun. No gun was found and there is no evidence that any of the three men were armed at any time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It sounds to me like excessive force was used,'' said Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who characterized the 50-shot barrage as ''unacceptable'' and ''inexplicable.'' Referring to Mr. Bell and his two friends, the mayor said, ''There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The thing that is most unacceptable about this case is not the total number of shots fired, but the fact that five New York City cops were so willing to begin firing at all -- willing to take the life of another human being, and maybe a number of human beings -- without ever establishing that there was a good reason for doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under Mayor Bloomberg, there is a much better tone in the city with regard to police-community relations, and race relations in general. But when it comes to the Police Department, an improved tone won't count for much if policies and procedures aren't changed to prevent cops from blowing away innocent individuals with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This has gone on for far too many decades. Yet there is still no sense among public officials that big changes are necessary. The cops who killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded his two friends haven't even been questioned yet by the police or investigators from the Queens district attorney's office. The D.A., Richard Brown, is preparing a grand jury investigation but he told me it could still be weeks before the cops are questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, the community, which is sick of these killings, is simmering. Along with the candles and flower arrangements that have been placed at the site of the shooting were bitter signs denouncing ''police murder'' and, in some instances, calling for violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Rev. Al Sharpton, who represents the Bell family, has publicly called for patience and calm. But he added, and I agree, that the mayor and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly have an obligation to develop effective new strategies for reining in reckless police behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crucial first step, in my opinion, is to insist that police officers, including those who are black, recognize the essential humanity of all the people they are supposed to be protecting and serving. Not everyone with dark skin is a perp.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has overseen the streets of New York for the last five years in the style of a global warrior against terrorism. With a self-confidence that strikes some people as imperious, and some as impressive, Mr. Kelly has created a network of police officials overseas, recruited former C.I.A. officers and built a 1,000-member terror unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet over the last few days, Mr. Kelly has had to return to an earlier, less-novel role: the face of a police department involved in yet another public furor, this one a fatal shooting that has the makings of a combustible controversy involving race, politics and the police use of deadly force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelly's role in the investigation and his handling of that shooting in Jamaica, Queens last Saturday, in which a young black bridegroom died, has all but been a flashback to his first tour as commissioner, in 1992 and 1993. Then, as the choice of New York's first black mayor in the aftermath of confrontations in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Mr. Kelly took charge at a moment of considerable daily violence and raw racial emotion, in a city of metastasizing mistrust between black and Hispanic New Yorkers and police officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those tensions have in some ways eased, and Mr. Kelly's relationship with police critics like the Rev. Al Sharpton is good enough that the two men talked just hours after the Queens shooting. The commissioner said in an interview: ''We have an arms-length relationship, but we've dealt with each other for years, and I've always found him to be forthright. He is telling it as he sees it, and not being duplicitous in any way. I think he would say the same about me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly also took the more forceful step of putting the five officers who together fired 50 rounds in the 4 a.m. confrontation with the group of young black and Hispanic men on paid administrative leave and stripping them of their weapons. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the return to this delicate public role as a truly local commissioner also brings new complications for Mr. Kelly, 65. He is routinely discussed in political circles as a possible candidate for mayor in 2009, something he has not ruled out, and his actions are apt to be seen as having potential political consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is also, for the moment, caught between a mayor who has called the shooting ''inexplicable,'' an array of black leaders who want answers that Mr. Kelly has yet to deliver, and his own officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a tough situation for everybody involved, and especially Ray,'' said former Mayor David N. Dinkins, who named Mr. Kelly commissioner more than a decade ago. ''He's a straight arrow and I would expect the best from him. There's also a lot of people who expect a lot from Ray in this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly said that he is as comfortable as ever being the face of the police in a controversy, though he is not so cocky as to predict outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think you build relationships, and you can go back to other incidents perhaps where people relied on something I've said or I've done, and hopefully that's built up a certain level of trust,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''You hope that is something that is going to play a role.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I've always prided myself on being forthright and open with the community, and not holding very much back -- what you see is what you get with me,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the hours after the shooting and since then, Mr. Kelly has been more visible than usual in his take-charge role, and it has been far from simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was at the scene in Queens within hours of the shooting, and spent the day gathering details and sharing them with the mayor's office, other leaders, and Mr. Sharpton, who was designated as an adviser by the family of the slain man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Kelly delivered the city's explanation of the shooting, at a news conference that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next day, Sunday, Mr. Kelly took the guns from the officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There were, and are, still too many unanswered questions,'' Mr. Kelly said in the interview. ''It's a privilege to have a gun; you don't have a right to have a gun.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And on Monday, the commissioner calmly answered his critics at a private meeting with black leaders and department critics, including one who called for Mr. Kelly's resignation. He also found himself standing by as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg described the 50 shots that killed Mr. Bell as unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later that day, on an NY1 News political talk show, Mr. Kelly was no longer discussing Qaeda sleeper cells and was instead trying to address all sides in the Queens case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The mayor is certainly entitled to his opinion,'' he said on NY1. ''I think we need an in-depth examination of all the facts. It is unusual to have this number of shots fired.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Explaining police culture in pithy, made-for-television language is not always a skill commissioners possess, but it is a trademark of Mr. Kelly's -- not to mention a political asset, said Lee Brown, who preceded Mr. Kelly as commissioner under Mr. Dinkins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Ray brings, to any issue, his experience as a well-educated, well-trained, well-disciplined former marine who knows how to talk like people talk,'' Mr. Brown said. ''When things occur, like his work with us in restoring calm in Crown Heights, you can expect him to stand on that foundation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly has earned some praise for sharing information with sometime critics like Mr. Sharpton, even if doing so made him seem unconcerned with irritating some of Mr. Sharpton's detractors in his department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton had his own blunt way of saying what is still at stake for Mr. Kelly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Ray Kelly's word is seen as good in a lot of our community, but now his word is on trial,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''He has to come up with more definitive answers about why this young man was shot and killed in Queens. I think this is the greatest challenge of his career. It could result in Ray Kelly having a halo around his head, or the undoing of a very popular image.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there are also skeptics, and there is anger. Complaints about Mr. Kelly this week have boiled down to this: Despite his personal touch, relations between the police and minorities remain in many ways strained, and sometimes explosive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Ray Kelly may be the same man who was police commissioner under Mayor Dinkins, but I think he is a different kind of commissioner today, and that worries me,'' said the Rev. Charles L. Norris, pastor of Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church, in Jamaica. ''I'm not confident anymore that he is solving the problem.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly said he has a long history inside the department and as a government official in Washington of improving the culture of agencies, combating racial profiling, and holding his own people accountable. He also said his diplomatic skills in times of crisis have not atrophied in the years that his focus has been pulled toward domestic security, an effort that is without precedent in the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He cited the case of Timothy Stansbury Jr., the unarmed 19-year-old who was fatally shot by a police officer in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in 2004, as an instance in which, early on, he judged a shooting to be unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In the Stansbury case, we had information because of statements from the nonshooting officers, so we put out the information,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''We don't have enough information yet in this case. I make a determination about what to say based only on the facts.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some observers have said that Mr. Kelly's recent reimmersion into the world of shootings and racial politics and the perceptions of police officers in southeast Queens, rather than those in Scotland Yard, may have a political payoff if he indeed runs for mayor. Mr. Kelly said he was not thinking about 2009, but declined to flatly rule out a bid. If it is not on Mr. Kelly's mind, though, his performance this week nevertheless has displayed some political prowess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think the way he conducts himself in front of the press, acting as the objective conveyer of information, while still appealing to everybody to reserve judgment, shows how he would handle a city crisis, political or otherwise,'' said Richard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a nonpartisan group that monitors police policies in New York. ''You can't see every police commissioner as a political candidate, but you can with Ray.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the days after the groom-to-be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died in a 50-shot fusillade fired at his car by five police officers, city officials have gone into detail about the Police Department's guidelines for shooting at a moving vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rules, in the department's Patrol Guide, are clear: ''Police officers shall not discharge their firearms at or from a moving vehicle unless deadly physical force is being used against the police officer or another person present, by means other than a moving vehicle.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, by citing the guidelines, raised the possibility that the five officers who shot at Mr. Bell might have been in violation of the department's internal rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You should know that it is not the policy of the Police Department, where a police officer can shoot at a car when the car is being used as a weapon,'' Mr. Bloomberg said Monday at a City Hall news conference. ''So at least, in that case, it would appear that the policies of the Police Department were broken.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly said, ''As far as the policy of using deadly force against a vehicle -- we have a policy that prohibits that if the only deadly force that's being used against you is the vehicle itself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in a series of other recent confrontations in which police officers shot at drivers trying to run them down, police officials voiced unambiguous support for the officers involved. In two police shootings since last month -- one in which an officer fatally shot a driver -- the police said the shootings appeared reasonable, at least after preliminary investigations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Nov. 11, when a driver in Brooklyn was killed by the police, the officers saw him pointing a gun. In the other, in the Bronx, on Oct. 27, a loaded 9-millimeter gun was found in the driver's waistband and a second gun was in the car, according to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Saturday's case, at least one police officer appeared to have believed the men in the car had a gun, but no gun was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three police shootings -- and the official statements about them -- underscore the nettlesome aspects of trying to set rules for unforeseeable, potentially deadly situations that unfold in seconds. To some, including many retired officers, the guidelines are confusing, even contradictory, particularly since an overarching statement in the Patrol Guide states that the primary function of all officers is ''to preserve human life.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andrew Quinn, a lawyer who is general counsel to the Sergeants Benevolent Association, observed that the policy is more restrictive than the state's penal code. And a veteran prosecutor who has investigated previous police shootings suggested that the hard-and-fast rule is contrary to common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Patrol Guide definitely states that, and it's hard to believe that it says it, that you can't use deadly force against a vehicle,'' said the prosecutor, who refused to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Every cop you say that to says, 'Oh, come on,' '' the prosecutor said. ''It seems at best to be selectively enforced.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, some defended the policy as written. John C. Cerar, a retired commander of the Police Department's firearms training section, said, ''Guidelines are guidelines, and they can be violated without breaking the rules.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When asked about the policy, Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, said, ''What we look at is the totality of the situation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''We don't know the totality of this event yet.'' But of the two previous shootings, Mr. Browne said, ''There was more than the threat of the automobile alone involved.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, in the Oct. 27 shooting, Mr. Quinn said that Sgt. Edward Warren was not shooting at a car, but ''at a driver who was armed and who was about to shoot a cop.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is idiotic,'' he said of the policy. ''There are absolutely circumstances where a car can be used as a deadly weapon, and the only way a cop can save his life or the life of a fellow officer or the life of a civilian is to use his handgun.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly has been careful not to characterize the conduct of the five police officers involved in the shooting of Mr. Bell. None of those officers have been interviewed by officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Talk of a gun, however, has colored the early reports of what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a confrontation before the shooting outside a Queens strip club, Joseph Guzman, an acquaintance of Mr. Bell's, shouted, ''Yo, get my gun,'' the police said. Later, according to the account of a police lieutenant at the scene, a detective working undercover who was shadowing Mr. Bell and his acquaintances called the lieutenant just before the shooting to say the situation was getting ''hot,'' and, ''I think there's a gun.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton led relatives and community members on an angry and emotional visit yesterday morning to the Queens street where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed 23-year-old black man, was shot to death in a hail of police bullets early Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the two civil rights leaders led their group, police officers continued searching the site for evidence yesterday, and investigators were seeking additional witnesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police were trying to locate a man who may have been in Mr. Bell's car on Saturday morning and another who witnesses say was at the heart of arguments outside Club Kalua, a cabaret, with groups that included Mr. Bell. That man was last seen dressed in black and standing in front of a sport utility vehicle with silver wheels in the moments before the shooting. It is unclear what role, if any, he played, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police described the man who may have been in Mr. Bell's car as being last seen wearing a beige jacket and running away from the shooting onto 95th Avenue, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As investigators working on the case seek the two men, the police are asking everyone arrested in the city whether they have any information about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case has attracted national attention, a fact underscored by the arrival of Mr. Jackson and by a call from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to Bruce S. Gordon, president and chief executive of the N.A.A.C.P., which wants the Justice Department to review whether the shooting violated federal civil rights laws. Mr. Jackson echoed that sentiment yesterday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gordon said the mayor, who has made fighting poverty a priority of his second term, had expressed interest in improving education and job opportunities for young black men. ''I at least find his approach to be refreshing,'' Mr. Gordon said, ''but in no way am I comforted, because this incident just points out the disparities and abuses in the system that have to be changed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday the mayor called the shooting ''excessive,'' a characterization that Gov. George E. Pataki agreed with. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Obviously, 50 bullets fired into or at an unarmed individual in New York is excessive force,'' Mr. Pataki said yesterday in a news conference broadcast by satellite from Kuwait, ''but the appropriate response to that is something that I think the investigation of the mayor and the police commissioner will reveal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton hinted yesterday that he might call for a shopping boycott to protest the shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly before 9 a.m., Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Jackson led elected officials and clergy members to the spot in Jamaica, Queens, where five officers fired 50 shots at Mr. Bell's car during a confrontation in which he drove into one of the officers and an unmarked police van. Two friends of Mr. Bell, Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31, were also in the car and were seriously wounded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Liverpool Street, at an impromptu sidewalk memorial of white carnations, red roses, candles and photographs taped to a brick wall, Mr. Bell's aunt, the Rev. Diane Shepherd-Oliver, a minister at the New Life Temple of Praise in Syracuse, called for God's help. ''Pray for the policemen and the other individuals who are injured,'' she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell's parents, William and Valerie, and his fiancee, Nicole Paultre, whom he was to wed the day he was killed, were among those in the group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We appeal to people: Don't do anything disruptive or in any way contrary to the memory of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''We do not want the world to see him as anything other than what he was. He was not violent. He was not a thug. He was not in the street. Don't use your anger to distort who he was.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Jackson said of the shooting: ''This is a symbol, not an aberration. Our criminal justice system has broken down for black Americans and the young black males.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman's sister, Yolanda, who has been at his bedside at Mary Immaculate Hospital, said of her brother, whom she helped raise: ''He's critical. He cannot talk. He has 19 holes in him.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman's companion, Ebony Browning, squeezed the hand of their son, Juan, 6, and lighted a candle and taped up a photo of Mr. Guzman. ''Pray for my child and pray for my husband, too,'' she said.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Pataki and Governor-elect Spitzer added their voices yesterday to the chorus of those speaking out about a shooting by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as the politicians weighed in on the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was killed outside a Queens club early Saturday, one of the men who was injured, Joseph Guzman, spoke for the first time from his hospital bed at Mary Immaculate Hospital. Afterward, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who was with Mr. Guzman at the time, said he was very clear: &quot;He just kept saying, 'They tried to kill me. They tried to kill me.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, investigators are reportedly looking for two possible new witnesses, one of whom may have been armed. One of the men was last seen, dressed in black, standing near Bell's SUV when the undercover officers opened fire. The other was last seen wearing a beige jacket and running away from Bell's car as the officers started shooting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new developments came on the same day that the Rev. Jesse Jackson joined Bell's mother, Valerie, in her first visit to the site of the shooting, outside the Kalua Club in Jamaica, Queens, where her son celebrated his last night as a bachelor. &quot;It's not about black and white,&quot; the Rev. Jackson said, standing near a collection of flowers, candles, and photographs outside the club. &quot;It's about wrong and right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some observers said the Rev. Jackson's presence reflects the level and breadth of concern regarding the case. &quot;I think the fact that Jesse Jackson was here, it reflects the national dimension of the story,&quot; a political consultant, Bill Lynch, said. Mr. Lynch also said the widespread attention could prompt local and state officials to be more diligent in their investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a press briefing in Kuwait, Governor Pataki expressed faith in that investigation, but said, &quot;Obviously, 50 bullets fired into or at an unarmed individual in New York is excessive force.&quot; He underscored his confidence in Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Mayor Bloomberg, who has called the shooting &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor-elect Spitzer, who, according to The Associated Press, also indicated the shooting was excessive yesterday, stopped short of calling for a special prosecutor to take over the case from Queens District Attorney Richard Brown, as some have called for. A spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer, Christine Anderson, said yesterday that he does not think there is a &quot;need to add another government entity&quot; to the mix &quot;right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As reports of two possible new witnesses surfaced yesterday, a spokesman for the Queens district attorney said he could not put a timeline on the investigation, which he said was still in its early stages. &quot;We're still gathering evidence, reports, audio, videotapes,&quot; the spokesman, Kevin Ryan, said. &quot;We want it to be thorough, fair, and impartial&quot; before presenting the case to a grand jury, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, relatives and friends of Bell and two others who survived the shooting, including Guzman and Trent Benefield, expressed anger while visiting the Jamaica club yesterday. &quot;This was unjust,&quot; Guzman's sister, Yolanda Guzman, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, it was unclear which elected officials would attend Bell's funeral, scheduled for Friday evening in Jamaica. Council Member James Sanders said he plans to attend, while a spokesman from the mayor's office has not yet indicated if Mayor Bloomberg would be there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders said yesterday that it would be a &quot;religious&quot; service, while Bell's mother has told reporters she prefers to have only close friends and family present. Community leaders are said to be organizing the funeral, which will be held at Community Church of Christ. The church, capable of holding 600 people, is where Bell was supposed to get married.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By immediately involving the district attorney in Queens County, on one level, Mayor Bloomberg effectively handled the shooting incident there this past weekend. The reaction from the community, while angry, has been restrained. We haven't, at least yet, seen the kind of sustained demonstrations we saw after the death of Amadou Diallo in 1999, nor the angry confrontations of the late 1980s that helped drive Mayor Koch from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another level, however, the mayor and the city may pay a price. Mr. Bloomberg seems to have tilted too far in his criticism of the police, and has accepted the presumption that this is a crime by promoting the involvement of the Queens D.A. New York City police officers, who must make split-second decisions of life and death, may have a right to feel skittish. They are responsible for reducing crime to levels so low that Gotham is now considered one of the nation's safest cities, only to see the mayor undermine their presumption of innocence when the chips are down. But despite this, the race baiters are regrouping and are seeking not just a special prosecutor, but also a federal investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What exactly would be investigated? It is easy to see the tragedy. The bridegroom killed on his wedding day. It is easy to see how technical rules of police procedure may have been violated. Or, perhaps, faulty judgment led to the fatal shots. Or, most probably, a combination of events, mistakes, and just bad luck brought us to this point. But that would seem to demand departmental action rather than a criminal probe. The presumption of innocence on the part of the police is the least they deserve from any mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easy for Mr. Bloomberg to now charge &quot;excessive force.&quot; He has the advantage of hindsight, knowing many things that the officers didn't. He did not have to make a split-second decision, since no vehicle struck him or any of his colleagues. But also among the things that the mayor knows, but the officers didn't, is that the three men involved, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who died of his wounds, all had arrest records, which include gun-related charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one lesson learned from the Diallo affair that has certainly helped the mayor keep the lid on the activist response was that the five police officers involved in this incident are a diverse lot. This is presumably by design, not accident. The four Diallo officers were all white, which gave credence on the street to activist charges that the incident had racial overtones. If it is accepted that race was not the reason that these young men were shot, then what is the crime?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No angry racial mob chased the victims into oncoming traffic. No race talk. If there is any real evidence that the cops were under the influence of alcohol, as has been suggested, I have yet to see it. If all this is true, then it is hard to see why a prosecutor is looking into this incident at all. I suspect that many police officers, of all races, feel the same way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is another lesson from the Diallo case. At the end of the day, the four police officers involved, all white, were acquitted, although they had to travel to Albany to get justice. In a moment that nearly ended Fernando Ferrer's mayoral bid, the former Bronx president acknowledged that the officers were &quot;over-indicted.&quot; Mr. Bloomberg should note that if Mr. Ferrer, who based his campaigns in large part on race matters, can recover from his brush with truth, the Republican mayor has little to fear and much to gain by exercising leadership and telling people things they may not want to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police guidelines on the use of a weapon may try to eliminate error, but can never completely succeed. Most police officers go through their entire careers rarely, and in most cases never, having to fire their weapons in the line of duty. These men seem to conform to that rule, despite being responsible for hundreds of arrests. Regardless of how this case comes out, my suspicion is that the active policing careers of most of these men has ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are offered heart rending stories of the cancelled wedding, the sobbing bride, and the two now fatherless children. The utterances of the Reverend Sharpton are reported in detail. The mitigating circumstances, such as the arrest records of Mr. Bell and his friends, and the admirable records of the police officers involved seem to get short shrift. It would be nice to see a gesture from the mayor such as his visiting with members of the police force - perhaps the Academy - to let them know that he and all New Yorkers know and value what risks they have taken and what they have done for the city in the years of declining crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people in our city are justifiably angered by this tragedy. We allrecognize, as the mayor has already noted, that firing 50 shots in thissituation was excessive. It also appears that at least one policeregulation (which prohibits firing at a moving vehicle) was broken thenight Sean was killed. We also need to carefully review the policy thatpermits undercover police officers to drink while on duty, even if it'spart of their undercover efforts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, this tragedy highlights a serious problem, either with policeprocedures and policies or with the actions of the officers on duty thatnight. We do recognize that the highly-charged, frightening and emotionalatmosphere of that night also played a role in the shooting. But it isabsolutely imperative that our community is able to place our faith in theprofessionalism of our police force, and know that they will act accordingto their internal rules and the rule of law, even in stressful situations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After meeting with Mayor Bloomberg, District Attorney Richard Brown andPolice Commissioner Ray Kelly, I am confident that their investigationswill be thorough and will uncover what went wrong and who is responsible - as well as what must be done to prevent this from happening again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, until those investigations are complete, we should focus ourenergy on helping Sean's family as best we can and getting to the truth sothat something positive might come from this terrible tragedy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a prayer service yesterday morning at the site of the shooting, Ijoined with Sean's fianc&eacute;e Nicole Paultre, his parents and the Revs. JesseJackson and Al Sharpton and I asked that everyone who has been hurt andangered by Sean's killing remain patient until the DA can deliver hisfindings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course it is not always easy to remain calm and patient in theaftermath of such an emotional incident. All too often, it is young men ofcolor, such as Sean, who find themselves the victims of police misconduct -a frustrating and frightening reality the minority community faces everyday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, I believe we will only hamper the investigation and negate thegood that could come of it if we look at this solely as a racial incident.We must remind ourselves that the undercover officers were a racially mixedteam and that this is more a matter of what's right or wrong with thesystem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is about policy and procedures that have to be followed when yougive authority to individuals, who we must trust and believe in so that wecan create and manage a civil society. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my meetings with Revs. Jackson and Sharpton, Reps. Charles Rangel andGregory Meeks, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Councilman LeroyComrie, we are discussing the possibility of a tri-level task force -  withelected officials from federal, state and local levels -  that wouldcarefully examine this tragedy and look for solutions that might help usavoid another senseless death. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, I hope that all residents of our great city and greatstate will keep Sean's family in their prayers and do whatever possible tohelp them cope with their loss and sorrow. And rather than acting orjudging in haste, I hope that we can all let the DA do his work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean's legacy can be something more than a wasted life of greatpotential. His tragic death can help our society develop better policiesand techniques that will assure a crisis of this nature does not happenagain. We must and can do better. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators ramped up their search yesterday for a mysterious fourthman who cops and witnesses say fled the scene of a shooting in Queens inwhich a groom died in a barrage of 50 police bullets hours before hiswedding, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops raided a Jamaica apartment building - where neighbors say injuredshooting victim Trent Benefield has been seen - in the hopes of uncoveringinformation that will lead them to that fourth man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed in the hail of police bullets as he and hiswounded friends sat in a car. The shooting injured Benefield and JosephGuzman, who is in critical condition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives hope the mystery man will be able to provide vital informationabout what happened early Saturday when Bell was killed after he and histwo pals left his bachelor party at a strip club in South Jamaica. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the three shot men was armed - and that has inflamed tensionsbetween police and the black community. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five cops who opened fire insist they saw a fourth man, wearing abeige jacket, hop out of the car as the fusillade began. Two civilians - aman and a woman - who did not see the shooting said they saw a man wearinga beige jacket run from the scene. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops said they thought one of the men in the car had a gun - raisingthe possibility that the fleeing man was armed and dumped the weapon as heran off. Officers were spotted Tuesday searching the area around theshooting scene for a firearm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Guzman, 31, who was shot 11 times and remained in criticalcondition at Mary Immaculate Hospital, spoke out about the shooting for thefirst time yesterday, saying that he was sure the police were trying tokill him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tried to kill me. They tried to kill me. They killed Sean. Theytried to kill us. We didn't have nothing. We didn't have nothing,&quot; he toldthe Rev. Al Sharpton, who visited him at his bedside, along with the Rev.Jesse Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They tried to kill us, they tried to kill us,&quot; Sharpton said he keptrepeating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman had been only semi-conscious until yesterday, when he was finallyable to speak about the night all hell broke loose outside the KaluaCabaret.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those are the most poignant statements he made and we tried to consolehim that we are working with him,&quot; Jackson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, he's just coming into his own consciousness and pleading forhelp,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;And we promised him we will do what has to be doneto get justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman had gone with Bell and Benefield to the club on Friday night tocelebrate Bell's impending nuptials. The club, however, was being monitoredfor prostitution by undercover cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the night wore on, an undercover officer inside the club spotted a mandressed in black carrying what the officer believed was a gun. Heimmediately called his supervisor, Lt. Gary Napoli - who was outside withother plainclothes officers - and reported there might be an armed maninside. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club closed not long after, at 4 a.m. Saturday, and an undercoverofficer spotted the man in black get into a heated argument out front withBell and his friends. The officer said he grew alarmed when he overheardGuzman yell, &quot;Yo, get my gun!&quot; sources have said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer decided to break cover and charged toward the car with hisgun drawn and badge displayed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell slammed on the gas pedal, striking the officer, who then openedfire. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre, the fianc&eacute;e of slain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, stood silently,dressed all in black, her eyes concealed behind sunglasses and tearsstreaking down her cheeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mourners lit votive candles, prayed and hung angry signs of protestagainst police brutality across the street from where bullet holes stillremained in parked cars. One sign read, &quot;Off the pigs who shoot our kids.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We come this morning with the family in their hour of grief,&quot; saidSharpton, standing near a makeshift altar of flowers and candles near theKalua Cabaret strip club in Jamaica. &quot;We're all family now. Not a blackfamily, not a white family, not a Latino family - a human family.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These days are days of mourning. We appeal to the people, don't doanything disruptive or anything contrary to the memory of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's aunt, Diane Shepherd-Oliver, prayed for his soul with an emotionalwail. &quot;I know my nephew is with you, oh, Lord,&quot; she said. &quot;I know Sean isin a better place.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, she said the pain of losing him was &quot;beyond words,&quot; and what stillechoes through her mind is the haunting &quot;screech&quot; her sister Valerie -Sean's mother - made over the phone when she told her about the tragedy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activists once again called for a thorough investigation of theshooting, which they called a civil-rights violation. A funeral service isscheduled for tomorrow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Business will not go on as usual until we get justice for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sharpton said. &quot;We will be shopping for justice while people go shoppingfor the holidays. There is going to be a big shopping spree for justice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there will be a &quot;mass movement&quot; after the funeral, but refused toelaborate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson linked the shooting to the cases of Haitian immigrant AbnerLouima, who was sodomized in a Brooklyn police station in 1997; AmadouDiallo, the unarmed Guinean immigrant who died in a hail of police gunfirein The Bronx in 1999; and Kathryn Johnston, 88, who was killed by cops inAtlanta a week ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I say to the families here today, don't let even this break yourspirit. Don't be silent, don't betray justice with silence,&quot; said Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our criminal-justice system has broken down for black Americans andyoung black males. We've marched and march, bled too profusely and died tooyoung. We must draw a line in the sand and fight back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plans for another rally at the strip club on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer put out a jointstatement yesterday saying: &quot;This tragedy has deeply saddened New Yorkers -and all Americans. It is of utmost importance that the investigatingauthorities, led by the Queens district attorney, conduct an aggressive,impartial investigation to ferret out the facts.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are some police officers thinking these days? That's a question even law-and-order advocates are asking following two horrendous incidents this past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was in northwest Atlanta, where plainclothes narcotics officers stormed the home of 92-year-old Kathryn Johnston. She shot at them, wounding three, and they returned fire, killing her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then last Saturday, New York City police sprayed 50 bullets into the car of an unarmed, pre-wedding bachelor party group, killing the 23-year-old groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounding two other men, one critically. The officers' shots struck the men's car 21 times after their vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and hit an unmarked police minivan. Fortunately, no one else was hurt, although the officers' gunfire also ripped into nearby homes and shattered windows at a train station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly says the incident is under investigation - that it's too early to tell whether the shooting was justified. But 50 rounds is a lot to unload in a crowded neighborhood, even if it is crime-infested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers may have thought they were under attack, but they could just as well have thought they were in an accident. No gunshots seemed to have been fired at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the bachelor party was black, two of the five police officers also were black, and one was Hispanic, so race bias does not appear to be a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta, the narcotics officers said they went to the old woman's house after buying drugs there earlier in the day from a dealer known only as &quot;Sam.&quot; Even though they had a no-knock search warrant, they said they announced themselves before entering and being shot at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the neighborhood they were in, drug dealers and home invaders often announce themselves as police to gain easy entry into old people's homes. This is why Ms. Johnston was armed and didn't trust the police even if they did announce themselves before they barged into her home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement is more complicated than many people think. Considering the many important decisions officers make daily, coming down harshly on the officers involved in these two incidents is premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in New York and Atlanta claim they followed proper procedures and, of course, federal investigations of the incidents will determine whether that's true. But when you look at what happened - an unarmed man killed and an old woman shot dead defending herself from what she thought were home invaders - you have to figure that if they did follow procedures, then those procedures probably should be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No-knock warrants are particularly odious. They should be issued only in the most extreme circumstances, and gaining entry into an old woman's home hardly seems to qualify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: Mayor Michael Bloomberg has weighed in to the uproar over a New York police shooting, saying officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man outside a strip club hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can tell you it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,'' Mr Bloomberg said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking after meeting New York officials and community leaders, including black civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton and congressman Charles Rangel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early on Saturday when police opened fire after a bachelor party at the strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell's car reportedly struck an undercover police officer and a police car as he pulled away from the club with two friends. Suspecting one of the men had a gun, police opened fire. All three were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first public comments on the shooting, Mr Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, told a radio station the people who shot him should not be called officers. ''They were murderers, murderers,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sharpton said the conference of leaders had been ''very candid''. The message to Mr Bloomberg was: ''This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have suggested the shooting was racially motivated, as the victims were all black. Of the five officers who fired, two were white, one was hispanic and two were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg said there was ''no evidence'' the victims were doing anything wrongbefore their car struck the police officer. For a mayor to question the actions of the police and defend the shooting victims sets a different tone for the city. Former mayor Rudy Giuliani was attacked in 1999 for responding slowly to the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times by four white officers, who were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bell shooting stemmed from an undercover case in the Kalua Cabaret club. Seven officers were investigating prostitution and drug use. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the groom was involved in an argument outside the club after 4am, and one of his friends had referred to a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover officer walked behind Mr Bell and his friends as they went to their car. As he walked towards the front of the vehicle, they drove forward, striking him and a police car, Mr Kelly said. The officer was reportedly the first to open fire, he said. One 12-year veteran fired his weapon 31 times.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramadi, 70 miles west of Baghdad, has been the scene of some of Iraq's fiercest fighting between U.S. forces and Sunni insurgents. It is the capital of Anbar province, where many Iraqi insurgents are based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bloodshed came on a day that saw sectarian violence kill 10 other Iraqis and wound about 50, police said. The bodies of 50 torture victims also were discovered, most of them in Baghdad and the city of Baqouba to the north, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Michael Bloomberg met Tuesday with the family of the man who was killed on his wedding day in a barrage of police gunfire as he left his bachelor party, and investigators questioned a third civilian witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after the fatal encounter, it remained unclear why four detectives and one police officer opened fire while conducting an undercover operation at a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified witness was on a darkened block in Queens when five police officers killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and injured two friends as the three sat inside a car, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two other civilian witnesses: One woman on the street who says she saw officers firing their weapons, and a second woman who from her window spotted a man running away from the area around the time of the shooting. Investigators tried to determine if that man had been with the three who were shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Bloomberg went to the Bell family's Queens church, where he met for about an hour with the parents and fiancee of the victim, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton. The mayor then met at a restaurant with about 50 community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JDEIDET YABOUS, Syria (AP) - The Syrian leader of an Islamic militant group blew himself up Tuesday after trying to cross into Lebanon and engaging in a gunbattle with Syrian border forces. Two border guards were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident raises questions about the security of the Lebanese-Syrian frontier, which Israel contends is a gateway for weapons to rearm Hezbollah militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes at a time of increased tension in Lebanon as the struggle intensifies between the anti-Syria government and factions led by Hezbollah, Syria's ally in Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian Interior Ministry said in a statement the clash began when Omar Abdullah, 28, the leader of the Islamic militant group Tawhid and Jihad, was challenged when he tried to cross into Lebanon with fake documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness said Abdullah was standing outside the passport control building when security agents approached. He opened fire with a handgun, wounding two guards, then ran toward the nearby village of Kfeir Yabous about 500 yards away.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover police officer who fired the opening salvo in a 50-shot barrage that killed a Queens man on his wedding day told his story Tuesday for the first time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective insisted he identified himself as a police officer long before he fired on the car carrying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, and two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This cop screamed, 'Police!' and he had his shield out,&quot; attorney Philip Karasyk told the New York Daily News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detective held his fire after Bell clipped him with his Nissan Altima, said Karasyk, who refused to name his client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once the car hit him, he jumped to the side,&quot; Karasyk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the detective saw the man sitting in the passenger seat -- whom police sources identified as Joseph Guzman -- reach into his waistband, the officer fired the first of 11 rounds at the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four other officers, believing they were being shot at, also fired on the car, Karasyk said. When the gunfire was over, Bell was dead and Guzman and another man, Trent Benefield, were badly wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The other officers believed the shots were coming from the vehicle,&quot; Karasyk said. &quot;They only did so in this case because they were in mortal fear for their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting occurred early Saturday as Bell and his friends left his bachelor party at a Queens strip club where police were conducting an undercover investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigators on Tuesday questioned a third civilian witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two other civilian witnesses: One woman who was on the street and says she saw officers firing their weapons, and a second woman who from her window spotted a man running away from the area around the time of the shooting. Investigators tried to determine if that man had been with Bell and the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg went to the Bell family's church in Queens, where he met for about an hour with the parents and fiancee of the victim, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton. The mayor then met in a restaurant with about 50 community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He held a similar meeting Monday in City Hall, where he declared that the officers appeared to use &quot;excessive force.&quot; He stood by his comments Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a civilian. I am not a professional law enforcement officer,&quot; he said. &quot;I used the word 'excessive,' and that's fine. That was my personal opinion. It may turn out to be that it was not excessive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have questioned whether the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were all black men. The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman James Sanders Jr. of Queens said he warned Bloomberg about possible unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I alerted the mayor that the temperature on the streets has increased to a large degree,&quot; he said. &quot;While we are sitting in these meetings, a lot of people are out on the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;To deal with a groom's death, Mayor Bloomberg is reaching out to community leaders.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call it a tale of two shootings. In each, an unarmed black man is killed in New York in a hail of bullets fired by police, fearing, rightly or wrongly, for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the different responses of city leaders to last weekend's shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Queens and the 1999 death of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx tell a tale of a city's evolution and its ability to learn the importance of acknowledging a community's outrage and responding to it. Such a changed response is evident not just in New York, but in other cities across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost as soon as Mayor Michael Bloomberg heard Saturday that police fired 50 times on three possibly unarmed black men, he began reaching out to political, religious, and community leaders, assuring them a full, fair investigation would take place. By Monday morning, the mayor, police commissioner, and dozens of black leaders - many still angry - came together at City Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the immediate aftermath of the 1999 death of Mr. Diallo, a West African immigrant shot in the entry to his apartment building, then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defiantly defended the police. He didn't meet with local black leaders until weeks later. Thousands of protesters poured into the streets, prompting more than 1,700 arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You learn from your errors,&quot; says Douglas Muzzio, a political analyst at the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College in New York. &quot;The reaction reflects in part the mayor's personality and the police commissioner's professional personality, but they learned from what Giuliani did, and they're not going to make the same mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's reaction is emblematic of changes in community/police relations across the country. From Cincinnati to Atlanta to Los Angeles, police departments have realized they need the cooperation and support of minority communities - those that usually felt the brunt of the &quot;get tough&quot; crime initiatives of the 1990s. In each city, fumbled political reactions to a charge of police misconduct - whether it was the 1991 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles or the 2001 shooting of a young black man in Cincinnati - have taught lessons about the importance of reaching out, urging calm, and dealing with nothing but the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's now a more proactive, customer-service-oriented attitude and response in the aftermath of these incidents because police departments all over the country now understand their aggressive enforcement actions are typically felt disproportionately in the minority communities, and that further strains police/community relations,&quot; says Jack Riley, acting director of the Center on Quality Policing at the RAND Corp. in Pittsburgh. &quot;With crime rates heading back up, the last thing you want to do is alienate a constituency you need to help keep crime level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New York, at a press conference with community leaders this week, Mayor Bloomberg remarked several times that no one was more &quot;disturbed&quot; than he and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly by last Saturday's shooting. Mr. Bell and two friends were leaving a strip joint after a bachelor party when an undercover officer, who was part of a larger operation at the club, thought he heard one of Bell's group say, &quot;Yo, go get my gun.&quot; When the officer approached the car, an altercation erupted and police started firing. It's unclear whether the officer identified himself as a policeman or what prompted the gunfire that killed Bell and wounded two others, one critically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, it is unacceptable and inexplicable how you have 50-odd shots fired, but that's for the investigation to find out what happened,&quot; says Bloomberg. &quot;We will tell everyone everything we know when we know, and we will not speculate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg also said he did not believe the shooting was racially motivated. Two of the shooting victims were black, and one was Hispanic. Two of the officers involved were black, two were white, and one was Hispanic. All five have been suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a much better response than the Giuliani administration [to the Diallo shooting], much more open and much more direct,&quot; says City Councilman Leroy Comrie of Queens. &quot;A lot of people in this city are uncomfortable with the police department and its tone on the streets, but so far I'm satisfied [that] the mayor and the police commissioner have done their utmost to provide as much detail as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most political analysts are applauding the city's response so far, but some say it's unfair to compare the way Mr. Giuliani and Bloomberg handled the two shootings. Giuliani, who defeated the city's first African-American mayor, had strained relations with the minority community from the start. In reforming the city's finances, he also took on its various interest groups, including those in the black community, according to political analyst Fred Siegel, author of &quot;The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York and the Genius of American Life.&quot; Finally, the Diallo incident occurred at a time when the mayor's personal and marital problems had become regular public fodder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Diallo affair comes at the beginning of Giuliani's personal meltdown,&quot; says Mr. Siegel. &quot;This isn't a criticism of Bloomberg. I just don't think it's a fair comparison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other analysts say the city is also different as a result of 9/11 and the work Bloomberg has done in repairing relations with the black and Hispanic communities. He's worked to keep lines of communication open on a regular basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't just have people talking to each other at a time of crisis. There has to be a foundation for communication. Otherwise, you're just managing the consequences of the crisis,&quot; says Mr. Riley of RAND.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,'' Mr Bloomberg said at a news conference today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early on Saturday -- only hours before Mr Bell's wedding -- after a bachelor party at a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first public comments on the shooting, Mr Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, told a radio station that the people who shot her husband should not be called officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They were murderers, murderers,'' she said. ''They were not officers. No one gives anyone the right to kill somebody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have also questioned whether the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were all black men. The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two non-Hispanic whites and one Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the victims, Bloomberg said: ''There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong'' -- referring to everything leading up to the moment they struck the officer with their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gunfire stemmed from an undercover operation inside the Kalua Cabaret, where plain-clothes officers were investigating alleged prostitution and drug use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has said the groom was involved in an argument outside the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover officer walked closely behind Mr Bell and his friends as they headed for their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he walked toward the front of the vehicle, they drove forward -- striking him and an undercover police vehicle, Mr Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg also said police appeared to have violated policy stating that officers cannot shoot at a vehicle used as a weapon if no other deadly force is involved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIMMERING anger over a deadly police shooting in New York boiled over yesterday as police admitted an undercover officer had been drinking before he opened fire on a car containing three unarmed men. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses contradicted an official version of events in which five police officers fired 50 shots at a car outside a nightclub in the Queens district, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, the day before he was to get married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of his friends were injured in the bloodbath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facing a third day of community protests, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg convened a summit of black leaders and government officials, during which he criticised the actions of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It sounds to me like excessive force was used,'' he said after the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has prompted anti-NYPD protests and black community leader, the Rev Al Sharpton, said many African Americans were justifiably frightened of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Sharpton said he told Bloomberg: ''Imagine, Mr Mayor, living in a city where you have to worry about the cops and the robbers. Some people have to worry about the robbers, we have to worry about both.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they opened fire on Bell and his friends after their car rammed a police vehicle and hit an undercover police officer, who was on foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But yesterday, a witness said police began firing without identifying themselves or calling for the car to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trini Wright, a dancer at the club, told investigators that it was the police who rammed the car the young men were in, not the other way around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly revealed that one of the undercover officers had two beers inside the club but was not given a breathalyser test after the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said undercover officers in the field were allowed two drinks and were not normally tested for intoxication but were instead judged fit or unfit for duty by their supervisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fiance and the mother of his two children, Nicole Paultre, also spoke publicly about the shooting for the first time yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told a New York radio station: ''First I would start by not referring to them as officers, they are murderers. They are not officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''No one gives anybody the right to kill somebody, to take someone's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They don't know what they've done. What pain they've caused to this family. To my kids.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg convened an extraordinary meeting of black religious leaders and elected officials at City Hall to calm frayed tempers over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man, calling the circumstances ''inexplicable'' and ''unacceptable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It sounds to me like excessive force was used,'' the mayor said Monday of the conduct of the officers, who fired 50 shots outside a nightclub in the borough of Queens early Saturday, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, hours before he was to be wed, and injuring two others. ''I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg made the remarks after meeting with some of the city's most influential black politicians and community leaders, including Representative Charles Rangel, the Reverend Al Sharpton and dozens of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor's decision to meet with Sharpton and other black leaders was a stark turnabout from the approach of Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph Giuliani, who did not reach out to black leaders in the immediate aftermath of the fatal 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who died in a hail of 41 police bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg's blunt assessment of events still under investigation was striking, although he took pains to point out that the facts were not all in, saying several times that he did not yet know what happened in the shooting, but that he expected that a grand jury would be impaneled by the Queens district attorney, Richard Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a move that suggests the officers feel their actions were justified, the lawyer representing the men said he had contacted Brown's office and offered to have the officers speak to prosecutors and appear before a grand jury voluntarily without immunity. Philip Karasyk, who is a lawyer for the Detectives' Endowment Association, said, ''We feel confident that once all of the facts and circumstances of this tragic incident are known, then our detectives will be exonerated.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This was a tragedy, but not a crime,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said that he intended to convene a grand jury to hear evidence in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants at the private meeting at City Hall, which included the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, and several high-ranking Bloomberg aides, described the discussions as frequently heated. Those more critical of the administration's response to the shooting, including Sharpton and a city councilman, Charles Barron of Brooklyn, sat on the opposite side of the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some policies appear to have been violated in the shooting, which occurred when, according to the police, undercover officers fired 50 bullets at Bell's car after he drove into one of the officers and an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting happened as the police were undercover in the club, Club Kalua, to investigate reports of prostitution and drug dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a dispute outside between two groups of men, and one group of three or four left. One undercover officer followed them, believing they might have been going to get a gun before returning to the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the officers' version of events, the undercover officer confronted the men in Bell's silver Nissan Altima, and they tried to run him over, prompting the fusillade from him and his backups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the leaders expressed dismay over Kelly's revelation that one of the undercover officers had had two beers in the course of the operation inside the nightclub, but was not given a breath analyzer test. Kelly said that undercover officers are allowed the two drinks and are not normally tested for intoxication. He said they were deemed fit for duty by their superior.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a critical moment in the deadly sequence of events that unfolded outside a Queens strip club early Saturday: in a crowd in front of Club Kalua, Joseph Guzman, according to the police, shouted, ''Yo, get my gun.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An undercover officer working at the club trailed Mr. Guzman and his friends to their car a couple of blocks away -- giving up his undercover role and inserting himself into a potential arrest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer, according to the account a colleague said he gave, confronted the group with his own gun drawn. A moment later, 50 shots had been fired, killing one of Mr. Guzman's companions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was to be married later that day, and wounding Mr. Guzman and a third man, Trent Benefield. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman, it turned out, had no gun in the car. Neither did anyone else. The officer's fear, if that was what motivated him, was unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the shooting, little has emerged about Mr. Guzman, 31, and Mr. Benefield, 23, or their version of those events. Mr. Benefield, according to a law enforcement official, has said he thought Mr. Bell, 23, panicked when he saw the armed officer, mistaking him for a threat and prompting him to step on the accelerator, setting off the crash that escalated the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as prosecutors and the police seek to learn the details of what happened, Mr. Guzman's actions, particularly as the police have portrayed them, seem destined for serious scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman has had several run-ins with the law in his life, records show, but his family and friends insisted he later embarked on a different path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman, it turns out, had completed a parole term on Nov. 4, a year after he was released from Bare Hill Correctional Facility in Malone, in upstate New York, where he served more than two years for selling cocaine to an undercover police officer on school grounds in Queens. He had earlier arrests dating back to 1992 that led to guilty pleas to disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman's most serious crime was committed in 1995, records show. It was then that he was arrested and sent to state prison for a gunpoint robbery in Queens, during which he appears to have fired his weapon at the man he was robbing. He served nearly two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last Saturday, Mr. Guzman himself became a victim. Seated in the passenger seat of the car driven by Mr. Bell, he was shot at least 11 times by one or more of the five officers who fired their weapons in the 4 a.m. darkness, wounded from his neck to his feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Monday of Mr. Guzman, Mr. Bell and Mr. Benefield. ''Clearly they were victims.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman remained in critical condition at Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica under the fiercely protective watch of his oldest sister, Yolanda Guzman, 34. On Monday, Ms. Guzman refused to let investigators from the Police Department's internal affairs division into his hospital room, certain that they meant harm, according to a family friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the hospital room, Mr. Guzman's family and friends have sought to paint a softer portrait of him -- as a father, a brother, a soon-to-be husband.. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Charles Aziz Bilal, who said he had known Mr. Guzman for 20 years, said Mr. Guzman had been trying to turn his life around since his last stay in prison. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He and other friends say Mr. Guzman's sister has acted as a surrogate mother to Mr. Guzman ever since their mother, Ruby Mae, and father, Joseph Anthony, died within a year of each other, she of breast cancer in August 1992 and he of a stroke in May of the following year, when Mr. Guzman was 17. A second sister, Ruby Guzman, was traveling from Virginia yesterday to be at her brother's side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two months after his mother died, Mr. Guzman was arrested for assault, but pleaded to a lesser charge, disorderly conduct. From then on, he was in and out of jail, and has served a total of 5 years and 7 months in jails or prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Bilal said Mr. Guzman, who worked as a bricklayer, tried to straighten himself out after his last release from prison in October 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He became a good role model for his kids,'' said Mr. Bilal. For all his run-ins with the law as a teenager and adult, Mr. Bilal said Mr. Guzman had been a happy-go-lucky child, with an enduring fascination with cutting hair. During his boyhood in South Jamaica, he routinely set up his own little barbershop, Mr. Bilal said, and cut the neighborhood kids' hair free with one of his most treasured possessions: haircutting clippers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guzman still cuts people's hair, and nurtured a passion for basketball, too. He grew into a muscular teen and finally a large and stocky man. He fell in love with a woman named Eboni Browning, now his fiancee, the mother of his two young sons. Ms. Browning appeared briefly in front of the hospital on Saturday but burst into tears when she was asked questions by reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not clear how Mr. Guzman and Mr. Bell met. Several of Mr. Bell's friends said that, unlike Mr. Benefield, they did not know Mr. Guzman very well. One of Mr. Bell's close friends, Mike Jones, 23, said he had only seen Mr. Guzman with Mr. Bell once or twice, and only in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was also unclear whether Mr. Guzman was to attend Mr. Bell's wedding, even though he was part of the bachelor party celebration and was with him until the violent end.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identities and career paths of the police officers involved in Saturday's fatal shooting of an unarmed bridegroom in Queens began to slowly come into focus yesterday, revealing a handpicked team of officers responsible for several hundred arrests between them without ever having fired a round in the line of duty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first to open fire Saturday is a 28-year-old black man of Haitian descent who lives with his mother in Brooklyn. One officer is white, a 12-year veteran, who has made by one account more than 600 arrests. And a third, the youngest, recently transferred to the team after four years working in Midtown Manhattan where he was known for his wit, street smarts and dry sense of humor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police Department, under orders from Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, refused to identify or provide biographical information on any of the officers, citing concerns for their safety. But two of their names and biographical information on a third have emerged in interviews with acquaintances and people familiar with the case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shooting, with five officers firing a total of 50 rounds at the car that was carrying three men leaving the Club Kalua, a strip club in Jamaica, has prompted political and community outrage. The team of officers consisted of five detectives -- one of them a woman -- an officer and a lieutenant. They were part of a team investigating the bar for narcotics and prostitution. Neither the female detective, who was working undercover, nor the lieutenant opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A second detective working undercover, a man, suspected one of the three men leaving the club of carrying a gun and followed them to their car, according to officials familiar with the officers' account of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The male undercover officer is 28, a six-year veteran. He fired the first shots after confronting the men and being hit by their car. An acquaintance of the officer said yesterday that Saturday's shooting had left him '' a little shaky,'' adding, ''He was upset.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officer grew up in Brooklyn, is single and lives with his mother, the acquaintance said. He has only 50 or 60 arrests because he has been undercover for most of his career, the acquaintance said. The number is low because undercover officers are not usually credited with arrests and, in fact, are expected to leave the scene before other officers make arrests, to protect their cover. He has one citation for meritorious police duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He feels very bad for the family of the deceased,'' the acquaintance said. ''He feels badly that this had to come to this. He sincerely, sincerely felt that he was in mortal danger. He's never fired his gun before and he hopes he will never fire it again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He fired a total of 11 shots as the other officers also fired. The bridegroom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was to be married that day, was killed, and his two friends wounded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One detective, Michael Oliver, 35, fired 31 rounds, according to an individual who knew the identities of the officers involved but was not authorized to release them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Oliver, who is white, joined the department 12 years ago, and has more than 600 arrests to his name, and multiple arrests involving guns, which the individual said underscored a history of restraint with his own firearm. His name was reported yesterday in The Daily News and The New York Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lowest-ranking member of the team was Officer Michael Carey, 26, with four and a half years in the department, a fast-rising officer with a dry sense of humor, according to those who worked with him at the Midtown South Precinct in Manhattan. He began as a member of an impact team, a group of several officers assigned to an area experiencing a spike in crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A sergeant at Midtown South who knew Officer Carey personally and had supervised him there said: ''Some people come out with a drive, and some people are lazy kids. He was a good learner. He excelled more than some other cops.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officer Carey had made more than 50 arrests during his first year in Operation Impact, breaking up drug and prostitution scams in Hell's Kitchen, the sergeant said. ''You got to be street smart. You got to be aware. He proved himself.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When it came time to move up, Officer Carey was promoted directly to the precinct's Street Narcotics Enforcement Unit, which the sergeant said ''was showing a lot of confidence in him.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Usually you get patrol. They sent him right to S.N.E.U., because he was so good,'' the sergeant said. ''They saw his drive.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two months ago, the sergeant said, Officer Carey was transferred to the vice squad in Queens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sergeant described Officer Carey as quiet, with a dry wit. ''He's not the type to run off his mouth,'' the sergeant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The highest-ranking officer at the shooting was Lt. Gary Napoli, 48, with 22 years on the job. He took cover when the shooting began and did not fire, the police said. A man answering his telephone at his home in Westchester County said, ''Goodbye, no comment,'' and referred calls to the department's public affairs office before hanging up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawyers for all of the officers who fired their weapons have said their clients will waive immunity and appear before the grand jury investigating the shooting. Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, whose office is leading the inquiry, has acknowledged that his office has been contacted by lawyers for the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday, a person involved in the inquiry said that investigators had requested reams of evidence, including photographs, 911 tapes and ballistics reports from the Police Department, as well as past complaints about the club and telephone records of the officers involved. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prosecutors received the Police Department's preliminary report yesterday, which the person said raised as many questions as it answered, adding, ''We've just begun to scratch the surface.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commissioner Kelly said investigators located another witness yesterday. ''We have identified another witness and he is being debriefed now,'' the commissioner said at a news conference. Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman, later said the witness had been a customer of the club that night. ''He's in the immediate vicinity of the shooting when it happened,'' he said. ''We're talking to him now. He's an independent civilian witness.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said investigators were looking for several witnesses in the area. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Based on certain witness statements, there are other people who were walking to their cars at the time,'' the official said. ''We can't say they saw it, but they may have.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Investigators also plan to review recordings from video cameras inside and outside the club, in an effort to identify the approximately 40 patrons inside.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg went to Queens yesterday to meet the parents and fiancee of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the 23-year-old man killed in a hail of police bullets on Saturday, as he continued his efforts to soothe tensions in the aftermath of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his private meeting with the family, which lasted nearly an hour, Mr. Bloomberg sat in a front pew at the Community Church of Christ, in Jamaica, with Mr. Bell's parents, William and Valerie. Nicole Paultre, who was to have married Mr. Bell on Saturday, later joined them, as did her mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby, in the church's sanctuary, were the Rev. Al Sharpton, State Senator Malcolm A. Smith, Deputy Mayor Dennis M. Walcott and the church's pastor, Bishop Lester L. Williams. In separate television interviews, Mr. Williams said he had invited the mayor to attend Mr. Bell's funeral on Friday, but Mr. Bell's mother said she would prefer to have only close friends and family. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I tried to express my deepest sympathies for their loss,'' the mayor said at a news conference. ''I don't think that any parent can understand what it would be like to lose a child until it happens, and I just pray that for most of us parents, we never find out.'' He added, ''There's nothing the mayor can do to bring back their son or their fiance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While some have called for rapid action in the case, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, who is leading the investigation, acknowledged that some community leaders he met with on Monday might have been disappointed when he told them that the inquiry was in its most preliminary stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They didn't hear what it is perhaps they wanted to hear, that it would be immediately presented to a grand jury and that we would immediately seek an indictment,'' he said. ''There is just a great deal of work that needs to be done before we can make any judgments with respect to where we're going.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown said he could not discuss specifics of the case, despite the public interest. ''My primary responsibility is to ensure that nothing compromises or prejudices my investigation,'' he said. ''And a discussion of that which purportedly occurred, based, in many instances, on preliminary information and in unsubstantiated facts, would be inconsistent with that responsibility.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were no signs that the furor over the shooting would die down soon. Mr. Sharpton announced last night that he would visit the scene of the shooting today with the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and Ms. Paultre. Also yesterday, Amnesty International USA, the human-rights group, called the shooting ''part of a pattern of questionable police tactics and abuse.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Local N.A.A.C.P. officials held a news conference last night and said they would call on the United States Justice Department to investigate whether there were any federal civil rights violations in the shooting. ''Every rule in the book was violated in this case,'' said Leroy Gadsden of the N.A.A.C.P.'s Jamaica branch. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After leaving the church yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg traveled to Thomasina Catering in St. Albans to meet with about 50 community leaders. Afterwards, at the news conference, the mayor acknowledged that relations between the police and the community were far from perfect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There were people that stood up and said we've made a lot of progress and there were people that stood up and said we have a long ways to go,'' the mayor said. ''And I think both of those groups were right on target.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly at his side, Mr. Bloomberg also conceded that many black New Yorkers believe that the Police Department practices racial profiling, although it is prohibited by city policy. ''There's a feeling among an awful lot of people that kids, particularly teenagers, young men, get stopped based on the color of their skin, and the commissioner and I both said that that is, No. 1, not the policy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite facing criticism from two police unions, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the Detectives' Endowment Association, Mayor Bloomberg defended his decision to characterize the shooting as ''excessive.'' But the mayor said, ''I am a civilian, I'm not a professional law-enforcement officer,'' and added, ''That was my personal opinion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly declined to characterize the shooting. ''I can't afford to have a visceral reaction,'' he said. ''I'm in charge of a 52,000-person organization. I'm also the final determiner as far as discipline is concerned in any process that goes forward. So I reiterate that I think we need this investigation to go forward as quickly as possible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But after Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, died in a hail of 41 police bullets in 1999, it took nearly two months for the Bronx district attorney to obtain murder indictments against four officers from a grand jury. Then, the trial was moved to Albany after an appellate court ruled that the officers could not receive a fair trial in New York because of huge demonstrations there. The officers were acquitted in 2000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, said at a breakfast with business leaders that a prolonged investigation could fuel anger. ''This is a very bad period for the mayor and the Police Department, because they can't give any answers,'' he said, adding that he hoped Mr. Brown ''realizes that he, too, has a responsibility to answer to the people of New York City.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Smith, who was at the Monday meeting with Mr. Brown, said he had urged the district attorney to move quickly. ''We understood and respected his desire not to compromise that process, or end up going too fast and blowing the case, but we believe he has to move expeditiously,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly said yesterday that the undercover officer who fired the first shot on Saturday might have had a drink, but that drink would have been consumed at least three hours before the shooting, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Participants in the meeting with Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Kelly offered a mix of reactions. ''I think the mayor was being open and candid,'' said Manuel Caughman, an aide to Assemblyman William Scarborough. ''He told us as much information as possible.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others expressed frustration. Dorothy N. Ogundu, a physician, urged the police to improve training. ''Let's pray over the dead, but first, let's help the living,'' she said. ''Let's make sure one more person doesn't die unnecessarily like this.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still others said they believed the meeting was held mostly to keep them quiet. ''Underneath, we're not calm,'' said Irene Marcelle, a retired school counselor. ''We don't feel the mechanisms are at work to really bring peace and justice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert A. U. Hogan, president of the residents association at the Baisley Park public housing project, noted the absence of young people at the meeting. ''No one in that room,'' he said, ''is going through what the young people are going through in this community.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queens district attorney, Richard Brown, has gone to hundreds of crime scenes in his 15 years in office, but he didn't rush to Jamaica early Saturday morning when he learned that police were involved in a shooting that left a man dead on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't because Mr. Brown wasn't awake - the 74-year-old was up and out of bed when he took a call from a senior aide at 5 a.m. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been dead for only an hour, but Mr. Brown said he wanted to be careful. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I decided that my presence there at the scene would intrude upon, in one respect or another, the investigation,&quot; the district attorney said yesterday in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown dispatched his deputies to the scene, but the former appellate judge will be front and center in a case that threatens to reopen deep wounds between predominantly black communities and law enforcement. Critics of Mr. Brown's office have already called for Governor Pataki and Governor-elect Spitzer to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the Bell case, but Mr. Brown is adamant that it stay in local hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a case that should be investigated and responded to by the people of Queens County,&quot; Mr. Brown said. Saturday's police shooting was &quot;amongst the most important investigations that we've had here in this office in the 15 years that I've been district attorney,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already worried that a judge could order a change of venue should the case go to trial, Mr. Brown said he cautioned Mayor Bloomberg, in a conversation yesterday morning, to guard against making statements that would prejudice the investigation. The district attorney also issued a similar warning to Bell's family, Queens elected officials, and clergy members, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, at a meeting in Mr. Brown's office Monday night. Mr. Brown said he cited the case against police officers in the 1999 death of Amadou Diallo, in which the venue for a trial was moved to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would urge everyone to withhold judgment and lower the level of rhetoric until all of the facts are known,&quot; Mr. Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor on Monday and again yesterday said the firing of 50 shots by police seemed &quot;excessive.&quot; The district attorney wouldn't comment on those statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown - known to many as Judge Brown because of his long tenure on the bench - first won election as district attorney in 1991 after Governor Cuomo had picked him to serve out the term of the retiring John Santucci. Before his appointment, he had served for 10 years as an associate justice in the appellate division of the state Supreme Court. He's prosecuted his share of controversial cases, and he won the conviction of the only man still residing on New York's death row, John Taylor. In the &quot;Wendy's massacre,&quot; Taylor in May 2000 herded seven workers into the freezer of a Wendy's in Flushing and shot them all in the head, killing five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lifelong resident of Queens, Mr. Brown has been reelected three times with little opposition, and he elicits praise from many city leaders. That includes Mr. Bloomberg, who yesterday said Mr. Brown &quot;has the kind of record that should give everybody in this city confidence that he will do the kind of professional, fair and impartial job that we want our law enforcement district attorneys to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the accolades are not universal. Some in the black community in Queens who have long complained of abuse and racial profiling by the police say Mr. Brown is too close to the Police Department. &quot;The district attorney has not been too good to the African American community in this area,&quot; the pastor of Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church in Jamaica, Rev. Charles Norris, said. As a chief example, Rev. Norris cited the case of a black 17-year-old, Xavier Simpson, who was arrested in June and charged with disorderly conduct. Mr. Simpson claims that four police officers beat him up, breaking his elbow and wrist. Mr. Brown dismissed the charges against Mr. Simpson last month, but he has not prosecuted the police officers, angering some in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district attorney's office said the complaint was referred back to the internal affairs bureau of the Police Department, along with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does he have a reputation for doing everything a community wants? No. But he has a reputation for being thorough,&quot; a City Council member representing Jamaica, Leroy Comrie, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brown said he had &quot;the respect of the law enforcement community and the confidence of the people of the county.&quot; His goal, he said, was to complete his investigation &quot;as expeditiously as possible&quot; with the reputation of his office intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 74, the district attorney said he wakes up by 6 a.m. and often works past 10 p.m. He still plays doubles tennis almost every weekend, often in Litchfield, Conn., where he shares a country house with his wife, Rhoda. Mr. Brown is up for reelection next year, but he says he has no plans to retire and wants to match the tenure of his counterpart in Manhattan, Robert Morgenthau, who, at 87, has held office for 31 years. &quot;I, a mere child by comparison, look forward to serving at least as long as he has,&quot; Mr. Brown said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after gathering more than 30 leaders and clergy members at City Hall to defuse the fallout from this weekend's fatal shooting, Mayor Bloomberg spent yesterday jockeying to keep dozens of community leaders on his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloomberg met for the first time with the family of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was shot and killed Saturday by undercover police after celebrating his last night as a bachelor with two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are obviously feeling incredible pain and the one thing that they would like the mayor to say is the one thing the mayor can't say,&quot; Mr. Bloomberg told reporters after meeting with Bell's parents, fiancee, and fiancee's mother at the Community Church of Christ in Queen. &quot;There's nothing the mayor can do to bring back their son or their fiance.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton and several others were also at the church during the meeting. Afterward Mr. Bloomberg met with about 50 community leaders at Thomasina's Restaurant, the same venue where a group of Queens' clergy members endorsed him for re-election last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloomberg's decision to hold another round of meetings after Monday's summit underscores just how far he is going to court support among key African American leaders who could be crucial in maintaining calm in the city as the case is investigated by the Queens District Attorney, Richard Brown. The meetings seemed designed to help him stay in front of a situation that has emerged as one of his biggest political tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surrounded by about a dozen of those who participated in the Thomasina's meeting, Mr. Bloomberg used toned down language. He said it was still his view that the 50 shots fired by police seemed &quot;excessive,&quot; but said that he was not there and that &quot;it may turn out to be that it wasn't excessive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also suggested that if the calm is not maintained a possible trial could be moved out of the city. &quot;What we don't want to do is to have another case - remember the Diallo case the trial actually got moved upstate because there was so much going on here,&quot; Mr. Bloomberg said, referring to the 1999 case involving Amadou Diallo. &quot;I certainly would rather have it here so I want to make sure we do not prejudice the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Bloomberg's police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, declined to say whether he agreed with the mayor that the number of shots fired seemed inappropriate. He said as the head of the department with the responsibility for deciding on a punishment that he would wait for district attorney's office to conclude its investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelly said police were &quot;debriefing&quot; another witness yesterday. Sources familiar with the investigation said the police located the new witness Monday after he had been arrested outside the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case seems to have unearthed tensions that have long existed in between the police and minority communities. Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday's meeting focused more on those relations than on the Bell case. He said many attendees expressed concern about people getting stopped by police &quot;based on the color of their skin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Democratic minority leader in the state Senate, Malcolm Smith, an African-American from Queens who has emerged as an ally to the mayor, said young black men shouldn't be targeted simply because they are &quot;wearing pants that are hanging down and have a hat on backwards.&quot; He said he is looking at organizing city, state, and federal elected officials to review NYPD procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloomberg said racial profiling is against police policy and that the NYPD is the only &quot;big police department&quot; in the country that has a policy against it. He said relations are not perfect, but have dramatically improved and would continue to be a city priority. And he reiterated that the Bell case did not seem to be racially motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer for the Detective Endowment Association, Philip Karasyk, said last night said he was confident the detectives would be cleared and said they had reason to believe Bell and his friends had a weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Council Member James Sanders Jr. said the mayor is responding to community, but that the &quot;temperature on the streets has increased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we are sitting in these meetings a lot of people are out on the streets and they don't see and hear these things,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also yesterday, the executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, Michael Meyers, and civil rights attorney Norman Siegel called on Governor Pataki and Governor-elect Spitzer to appoint an &quot;Independent, Special Prosecutor&quot; to investigate the Bell case rather than having Mr. Brown handle it. Representatives for Messrs. Spitzer and Pataki did not return calls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg's decision, in the midst of the crisis over the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to turn to the Reverend Al Sharpton is one of those errors that he is going to have to deal with as he contemplates a campaign for the presidency in 2008. New York City itself will no doubt survive the faux pas, because the fact is that police shootings in this city are among the lowest per capita of any big city. And the idea that the leadership of the police department is somehow racist, or even indifferent to the sensitivities of the minority communities in this city, is going to be hard even for the critics of the police to credit. But the mayor's reputation as a leader in a crisis, that is something that takes a long time to earn - and the mayor has had a good run of it - but that can be damaged in a matter of hours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have no doubt that the mayor's reputation suffered Monday. Certainly thousands of New Yorkers shook their heads in amazement yesterday when they picked up their newspapers to see the pictures of the mayor embracing Rev. Sharpton. Amazement turned to dismay as the mayor promptly pronounced the firing of 50 shots by the police &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;unacceptable.&quot; It may well be that something went wrong, that the police erred. But it was precisely the mayor's responsibility at that moment to stress the need for avoiding the pronouncement of judgments. If he can be rushed into a premature pronouncement by the likes of Rev. Sharpton, how would he perform in a showdown with the likes of, say, Presidents Putin or Hu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So much for withholding judgment before all the facts are in,&quot; is how the president of the Detectives Endowment Association, Michael Palladino, characterized, to our Bradley Hope, the mayor's error. He said he thinks the mayor's comments &quot;unfairly taint the entire situation. &quot;The mayor wouldn't have had to be thinking far back into our recent history to appreciate the need for caution. A jury acquitted police of any criminal misconduct in using 41 shots against Amadou Diallo in the Bronx, which was, arguably, much less frightening a situation to the police than what happened over the weekend in Queens. In this case, police were confronting an adversary who, unlike Diallo, was in a car, and, also unlike Diallo, was accompanied by at least two and possibly three other persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the New York Post reports that all three of the men the police confronted had arrest records; Bell twice for drugs and once for a gun, another man for armed robbery, and a third for gun possession and robbery. Mr. Bloomberg has been on a campaign against gun violence lately. He has pursued it by convening press events in Atlanta and Boston with other mayors, speaking to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and dispatching private investigators outside New York to gather evidence to be used in civil lawsuits against gun dealers. All that may or may not help, but what experience shows actually does help reduce illegal gun violence is aggressive police work. That doesn't mean sending police out to shoot suspects without a trial, but it does mean backing up the police until all the facts are in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the officers in this case certainly deserve. The detective who reportedly fired 31 shots in Queens had also reportedly not fired his weapon in the line of duty, other than on a firing range, in 12 years. Plenty of questions are unanswered. Was there a fourth person who escaped with a gun? What do toxicology reports show about how much Bell had to drink before he got behind the wheel of a car? How about the reports that one of the men police shot had made reference earlier to returning to his car to get a gun? What does it do to police morale when the mayor rushes to judge detectives who may have made a mistake once in 12 years or who may have been correctly defending their lives from attack? It sends a message to the rest of the police force - you are better off signing up for a desk job or hanging out at a Dunkin' Donuts than trying to risk getting in the line of fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said all this, we're also of the mind to say that Mr. Bloomberg has been a fair, calm, and prudent leader. He hired and backed a great police commissioner. So the mayor is entitled to his own mistakes. The big one he has made here is more political than anything else. &quot;Sharpton's stature elevated to new heights,&quot; is the way the Associated Press headlined a dispatch yesterday about the red-carpet treatment that the reverend got at City Hall. That's the same Rev. Sharpton who threw himself into opposing the campaign for the Senate of the same Joseph Lieberman that Mr. Bloomberg was supporting. Rev. Sharpton's candidate, Ned Lamont, got trounced. As Fred Siegel of Cooper Union pointed out to us yesterday, &quot;As Ned Lamont made clear, having Sharpton close to you is not an asset.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police lieutenant in charge of the undercover unit that fatally shot a Queens groom will face tough questioning by department brass over his role in the tragic incident, sources said yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt. Gary Napoli, a 22-year veteran, was overseeing the club-crackdown task force outside a seedy South Jamaica strip joint early Saturday when one of his plainclothes officers blew his cover, pulled his gun and tried to stop husband-to-be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his pals, thinking they had a firearm, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was shot dead and two friends wounded in the ensuing 10 seconds of gunfire, during which 50 bullets were shot by five cops -  including 31 by one detective. Bell and his two friends were unarmed.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the shooting began, the undercover -  whose name The Post is withholding because of NYPD concerns for his safety -  hurriedly left the Kalua Cabaret and used his partner's cellphone to call Napoli, who was waiting with two other plainclothes officers in an unmarked car nearby.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there's a gun!&quot; the undercover told Napoli before rushing to follow Bell and his friends to their car, sources said. Napoli's team rushed to the location of Bell's Nissan Altima, which was parked on Liverpool Street, but stopped too far down the block to box it in. So a second unmarked police van that was following the lieutenant's car pulled up closer to it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell -  trying to escape, friends say, because he didn't know that the plainclothes men were cops -  struck the undercover twice with his car and smashed the van.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's when the undercover fired his first of 11 shots. The bullets led the other cops to believe that they were being fired on from someone in the car, so they, too, started shooting, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;[Napoli] believed that his vehicle and personnel were being fired upon,&quot; sources said, quoting the NYPD's incident report. &quot;Lt. Napoli attempted to seek cover in his rental auto until the shots ended.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said he ducked under the dashboard and then slid out the door and crawled on his belly to the front of the vehicle. He never fired. The lieutenant's conduct, as well as that of the other officers involved in the incident, will be scrutinized by NYPD officials, sources said. A grand jury is set to convene on the case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The middle-aged lieutenant -  reached yesterday at his Westchester home, where his wife was decorating the lawn for Christmas -  waved off a reporter, saying, &quot;Please, no. Please, no.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One police source insisted of Napoli: &quot;The guy was doing everything he was supposed to be doing&quot; during the mayhem.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbor Joe Kokasko, 59, a retired Sanitation official, called Napoli &quot;as sweet as could be.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's friendly. He's not an angry cop,&quot; Kokasko said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the embattled cop who unloaded the 31 bullets is still vehemently insisting &quot;he was right,&quot; a top-level source said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a split-second decision I had to make, and I did,&quot; the detective, Michael Oliver, told the source. &quot;The guy believes in what he did,&quot; the source added of Oliver, a 12-year-veteran.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He feels terrible for the [Bell] family over what happened. He's saddened for what everyone is going through. But this was, 'I thought I was getting fired upon.' &quot;       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said the undercover identified himself as a cop, which is very rarely done, only because &quot;he thought he was preventing a murder.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He feels terrible,&quot; the source said of the cop, who is single and was described as very close to his Haitian dad and Mexican mom.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops have claimed that there was a fourth man in the car who escaped before the undercover could reach it, and they think he may have had the gun they were looking for and possibly tossed it as he fled.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officials said they had &quot;made progress&quot; in their hunt to identify the man.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60 uniformed cops scoured the area around Liverpool Street, looking for a gun. They focused on the AirTrain yard about a half a block away, using backhoes and rakes to sift through piles of dirt and debris.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities said they have found a third witness to the shooting and were talking to him. They also were scouring video footage from security cameras at the club to see who was coming and going -  and with whom - to try to root out more potential witnesses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two officers with Napoli were identified by sources as Paul Hedley and Mark Cooper.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hedley, who was driving the car, fired once before chasing down Bell's friend Trent Benefield, who was in the Altima. Hedley has been on the force eight years and is a former Army captain who recently spent a year in Kuwait.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, who fired four times, is a 17-year vet and a churchgoing family man with four kids.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fifth officer, Michael Carey, was with Oliver in an unmarked police van and fired three shots.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD and New Jersey authorities said they had received information that gangs may try to now target cops in retaliation for the shooting.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOR a very smart guy, Mayor Mike sometimes exercises stunningly bad judgment.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it has been this week, in the wake of Saturday morning's explosive 50-round burst of police gunfire in Queens; one man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died, and two companions were wounded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, Mayor Bloomberg proclaimed the fusillade &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;unacceptable&quot; - extraordinary words coming from New York City's chief executive.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He might better have termed the tragedy &quot;unfortunate&quot; - if not actuarially inevitable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would not have soothed those who prosper from such tragedies, but - given the lack so far of even a hint of bad faith on the part of the police officers involved - it would have better served the cold, hard truth.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is that the NYPD made 357,000 arrests in 2005 alone - each and every one of which represented a potential for conflict of the sort that ended so tragically in Queens at 4:30 a.m. last Saturday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cowboy cops?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardly. One needs to reach back to 1999, to the death of Amadou Diallo, to find circumstances similar to those present Saturday morning: Darkness, confusion, high tension, fear - and wild, reckless police gunfire.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Diallo shooting was a catastrophe of the first order, resulting from a gross breakdown of the good order and discipline for which the NYPD is universally known and admired.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a jury subsequently determined that no crime had been committed, despite the efforts of the usual suspects to elevate the incident to criminal status - indeed, many of those now practicing civil incitement were staples of the Diallo demonstrations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those disturbances, of course, had much more to do with then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani than they did with Amadou Diallo.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the shooting clearly had struck a chord in New York City, the fact is that the most vocal of the critics were demagogues whose high-decibel demands had once shaped city policy - but whom Giuliani had dismissed out of hand when he took office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They never forgave him for that, Sharpton and Barron and the rest, nor will they ever. So just imagine their joy Monday when Bloomberg invited them back into the public dialogue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven-plus years have passed since the death of Amadou Diallo. In the interim, 16 NYPD officers have died in the line of duty (not counting the 23 killed on 9/11) - with five slain in just the past two years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Brooklyn yesterday, testimony was being taken in the murder trial of Ronell Wilson - accused in the 2003 execution-style murder of NYPD undercover officers Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those killings, too, were a rare enough event: Again, with emphasis, city cops make hundreds of thousands of arrests each year - virtually all without incident.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the deaths doubtless hang heavy on the minds of New York's Finest - as do those of Eric Hernandez and Kevin Lee and Francis Hennessy and Daniel Enchategui and Dillon Stewart and so on down the roll of honor.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This does not, of itself, excuse the apparent breakdown of discipline that seems to have precipitated Saturday's shootings. In that regard, the NYPD has some work to do.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it certainly helps explain why it happened.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg's proper public-policy role in such cases is to keep silent as to culpability while a district attorney sorts out the facts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do otherwise - and yesterday he was cautioning vaguely against changes of venue in any criminal trials that might proceed from the shootings - is to empower the social vultures who feed off private sorrow and public discord.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Bloomberg needs to remember that he is mayor of all the city - and that includes its cops.   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an odd moment in the aftermath of the police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Rev. Al Sharpton posing with Mayor Bloomberg before TV cameras at a City Hall press conference but then bolting before the first word was uttered.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg explained Sharpton's hasty departure Monday by saying the reverend had to rush to a meeting with the victim's family.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Sharpton hadn't wanted to attend the press conference at all - but was persuaded by the mayor to put in a brief appearance, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Sharpton at his side, Bloomberg could demonstrate that he had reached out to the most fiery critic of the NYPD.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by leaving early, Sharpton avoided putting himself in an awkward situation where he might have to publicly disagree with the mayor, whom some had expected to defend the police.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the press conference, Sharpton attended a meeting set up by the mayor with community and elected officials.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One participant said Sharpton &quot;turned to [Police Commissioner Ray] Kelly and said, 'I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, I still support you being commissioner. The bad news is, most commissioners I support end up getting fired.' &quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that point, state Sen. Malcolm Smith declared that it was up to everyone to maintain peace in the community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton responded by saying: &quot;You invited me into your house. I'm not going to kick the chandelier.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Sharpton, representing the Bell family, who first reached out to the administration Saturday - not the other way around, say insiders.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rev. Sharpton has played an excellent role in this process,&quot; Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott told The Post. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A day after claiming police used &quot;excessive force&quot; in the strip-club car shooting that left an unarmed man dead on his wedding day, Mayor Bloomberg yesterday said he was speaking only as &quot;a civilian&quot; - but then stated he wants the cops tried in Queens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to criticism from the police unions for labeling the actions of five cops who unleashed 50 rounds &quot;unacceptable,&quot; Bloomberg stated, &quot;I said what I believed. I am a civilian. I am not a professional law-enforcement officer.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although not a single indictment has been handed up in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, the mayor -  who urged New Yorkers not to rush to judgment -  was already talking about where the jury should sit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember the [Amadou] Diallo case,&quot; Bloomberg told reporters after meeting with community leaders in Queens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trial actually got moved upstate because there was so much going on here. I think it would be better to have it, if there is [a trial], I'd certainly rather have it here. So I want to make sure that we do not prejudice the case.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg was referring to the trial of the Bronx cops who in 1999 fired 41 shots in gunning down Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, when they mistook his wallet for a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A judge, citing pretrial publicity, changed the venue from The Bronx to Albany, where a jury acquitted the officers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was killed Saturday and his two friends wounded when cops, thinking one of them had a gun, squeezed off dozens of rounds at their moving car. The unarmed trio had just left Bell's bachelor party at a Jamaica strip club.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Bloomberg has gotten high marks from some black leaders for keeping the lid on a volatile situation, Detective Endowment Association chief Michael Palladino said &quot;premature statements made without the benefit of facts only serve to inflame tensions.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts said the mayor's good intentions could backfire by poisoning the jury well.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing that baffles me is he talks about restraint, then makes statements condemning the cops, which is inconsistent and improper,&quot; said lawyer Joseph Tacopina, who represented one of the cops charged in the infamous 1997 Abner Louima torture scandal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another lawyer said Bloomberg doesn't risk anything by speaking out about the shooting because bids to change venue are very common -  but they rarely succeed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if the mayor did not say anything, the defense attorneys were going to argue for change of venue,&quot; said Kenneth Thompson, a former federal prosecutor who argued the case against cops convicted of assaulting Louima. &quot;That's the oldest trick in the book.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By meeting with community leaders and criticizing the cops, Bloomberg has avoided the criticism that dogged then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani during the Louima and Diallo cases.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one former Giuliani administration official, who declined to be identified, said Bloomberg &quot;gets a pass&quot; on a lot of issues -  including his decision to offer his high-level opinion during a sensitive investigation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giuliani, the official said, was excoriated for making prejudgments in defense of cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rudy would go in one extreme, and Mike [will] go to another extreme, but it's pre-judging,&quot; said the source.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly distanced himself from Bloomberg's &quot;excessive force&quot; comment, saying, &quot;We don't know all the facts.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg yesterday met with Bell's fianc&eacute;e, his parents and the Rev. Al Sharpton for about an hour at the family's church.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, Bell's family went on to the J. Foster Phillips funeral home to plan his rites, which are set for Friday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They just killed my son for what reason? I don't think they even know,&quot; Bell's father, William, told ABC-TV Channel 7.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 people later attended a rally at the NAACP's headquarters in St. Albans, Queens.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: Mayor Michael Bloomberg has weighed in on the uproar over a police shooting, saying officers appeared to use ''excessive force'' when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man outside a strip club hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what happened,'' the New York City mayor said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had just met with elected officials and community leaders including the Reverend Al Sharpton, a black civil rights leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early on Saturday after a bachelor party at the strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first public comments on the shooting, Mr Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, told a radio station that the people who shot her husband should not be called officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''They were murderers, murderers,'' she told hip-hop station Power 105.1. ''They were not officers. No one gives anyone the right to kill somebody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sharpton called the conference a ''very candid'' meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the message to Mr Bloomberg was: ''This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have questioned if the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former mayor Rudy Giuliani was hounded for what some viewed as a slow response to the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times, in the Bronx, by four white officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four were acquitted of criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gunfire in the current case stemmed from an undercover operation inside the strip club.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Miami coach Frank Haith was on the sideline for Tuesday's 61-59 loss to Northwestern in Evanston, Ill., while police in New York continue to investigate the shooting death of his nephew. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was shot and killed by undercover police outside a New York strip club early Saturday morning after he attended his own bachelor party. Bell was scheduled to marry Nicole Paultre hours after he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell is the son of William Bell, who is Haith's older brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith said Tuesday that he will attend his nephew's funeral Friday in New York. He called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a &quot;good kid&quot; who was &quot;looking forward to getting married and beginning a new chapter in his life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith said that Bell had two children with Paultre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our family is devastated, but I would prefer to wait until all the facts are known before commenting further,&quot; Haith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, five undercover officers fired 50 bullets at Bell's car after he drove toward one of them and an unmarked police van. Two passengers in Bell's vehicle were also shot numerous times but survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and the two passengers -- Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield -- were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the shooting &quot;inexplicable&quot; and &quot;unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds to me like excessive force was used,&quot; Bloomberg told The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack McClinton led the Hurricanes (4-3) with 30 points on Tuesday night. McClinton was 5-of-9 on three-pointers and 7-of-8 on free throws. Brian Asbury was the next-highest scorer for the Hurricanes with nine points. All of Asbury's points came on three-pointers, where he finished 3-for-6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wildcats were led by Craig Moore, who scored 24 points, including 7-of-10 on three-pointers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading 50-47 with5:56 left, Northwestern (4-2) scored seven straight points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McClinton then scored six consecutive points and after Doyle hit a free throw for Northwestern, McClinton hit a three-pointer to cut the Wildcats' lead to 58-56 with 1:05 left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asbury made a three-pointer to get the Hurricanes within 60-59 with 15.3 left. McClinton then missed a chance to take the lead in the final seconds by missing a long three-pointer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith said he learned of the shooting early Saturday, but decided to coach the Hurricanes in their 98-66 victory against Lafayette at the BankUnited Center. UM players and assistant coaches did not find out about the shooting until after that game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haith will return with UM to Miami today. After attending the funeral on Friday, Haith will fly back home in time to coach Sunday's ACC opener against Georgia Tech.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is a longtime Philadelphia journalist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three things about New York have created a maelstrom in waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First: Despite its reputation as a relatively safe city, New York is Nervoustown, USA. Every time somebody snaps his fingers there, the noise makes people jump. A city that requires more than 40,000 cops to maintain order is a city that lives with deep trouble. The real surprise is that shootouts involving men and women in blue don't occur more often than they do in the Big Apple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second: People in certain neighborhoods are convinced their lives are valued less than others throughout the city. There's a barely managed, ever-present clash of cultures on the street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third: When the ever-present issue of race is added to the mix, well, things can blow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops are nervous in Nervoustown. Many of them think every crowd of three or more may involve a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may have contributed to the mess last Saturday morning, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, died in a hail of gunfire from five undercover police officers, who riddled a car in which Bell and two other unarmed men of color were passengers. The police officers were patrolling the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club in Queens. The patrol was part of a crackdown instituted earlier this year after Jennifer Moore, a New Jersey teenager, was abducted, raped and slain in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and two friends left the Kalua Cabaret, and when the men's car struck one of the officers, the undercover cops shot more than 50 times, with 21 bullets hitting the car. When the smoke cleared, Bell, who had just left his bachelor party - yes, this was his wedding day - had been shot dead. His two companions are still in the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some argue that the rarity of such shootings &quot;proves&quot; the police usually act with restraint and have not earned their reputation in some communities as renegades in uniforms. New York's finest are not the so-called cowboys patrolling the streets and alleys of the world's most famous metropolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Mike Bloomberg was quickly put to the test. Several community leaders angrily descended upon City Hall to demand a thorough investigation of the circumstances. Bloomberg did the only thing a mayor can do: He decried the disaster yet stood behind the police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is life in the big city. Eleven years ago, in the Bronx, police officers coming upon a bodega robbery fired their guns 125 times, with one officer firing 45 bullets. In 1997, Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, was assaulted with a broom handle in the men's room of a Brooklyn precinct by three police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1999, the city nearly exploded when an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, was gunned down by police, who shot him 19 times while firing 41 bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, a 19-year-old man was shot to death on the roof of a housing project. The police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, later characterized the shooting as &quot;unjustified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many say the Bloomberg/Kelly administration is a dramatic improvement over the Rudy Giuliani days, when the former mayor often seemed to defend police shootings reflexively and waged a personal vendetta against crime in New York. Crime did decrease under Giuliani, but at the cost of some lives and liberty, as citizens complained of less freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg called the Bell shooting &quot;excessive.&quot; Even such measured language raised the ire of some critics, who charged that the mayor was playing politics and catering to long-standing African American grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gatherings and vigils started the morning after the shootings. Investigations are under way in City Hall and in Queens. Allegations of improper practices and inadequate training have already begun. That's precisely what increases citizen suspicion of police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D., N.Y.) spoke thoughtfully of the latest killing by New York City's finest and waited for word from the district attorney of Queens before he'd make further remarks. His concern was for the safety of citizens of the city and the police officers as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parents of the dead man grieved silently at the periphery of the chaos surrounding the killing of Bell and the injury of his two friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, Bell's fianc&eacute;e, 22-year-old Nicole Paultre, mother of their two daughters, pitifully pleaded with Bishop Lester Williams to perform the wedding for her and her dead fianc&eacute; anyway. But, of course, it could not be legally done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As politics and protests played out all around her, Paultre, Bell's former high school sweetheart, was left with an ache in her heart and a stunning wedding dress with no place to wear it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuning out the orange-clad partisans, Vasquez and teammate Mike Jones led No. 23 Maryland to a 72-66 win last night, ending Illinois' 51-game nonconference winning streak at Assembly Hall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not afraid. I'm ready for this,&quot; Vasquez said after scoring 15 of his 17 points in the second half as the Terps recovered after blowing a 15-point lead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm from Venezuela, and I didn't come here just to sit on the bench. I came here to play,&quot; Vasquez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vasquez' steal and layup with 1:22 left to play gave the Terps the 65-60 lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Jones scoring 19 and Vasquez playing like an experienced veteran, Maryland was able to overcome the absence of shot blocker and rebounder Ekene Ibekwe, who sat out with an ankle injury. The Terps' 8-0 start is their best since the 1988-89 team won its first 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It should have been closer in the second half than it was,&quot; Illinois (7-1) coach Bruce Weber said. &quot;Then in the second half, we didn't grab it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other games:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Duke, DeMarcus Nelson scored 19 points as the No. 11 Blue Devils held on to beat Indiana, 54-51, in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. Freshman Jon Scheyer had 10 points for Duke (6-1), which extended its nonconference home winning streak to 45 games and remained the only unbeaten team in the 8-year history of the challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At UCLA, Josh Shipp scored a career-high 24 points, Arron Afflalo added 20 and the No. 1 Bruins (5-0) routed Long Beach State, 88-58.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Florida, Al Horford scored 12 points, Walter Hodge added nine in place of Corey Brewer (mononucleosis) and the fourth-ranked Gators (7-1) routed Southern, 83-27. Brewer, the team's best defender and most versatile player, could miss several games while recovering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Kansas, Darrell Arthur and Darnell Jackson each scored 13 points to help the No. 5 Jayhawks (6-1) rout Dartmouth, 83-32, handing the Big Green one of its worst losses ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Alabama, Mykal Riley and Alonzo Gee scored 22 points each and the No. 6 Crimson Tide (6-0) rallied to beat Louisiana-Monroe, 75-61, despite missing guard Ronald Steele, out with tendinitis in his right knee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Wisconsin, Alando Tucker scored 22 points, including 18 after being poked in the eye, and the No. 12 Badgers (6-1) beat Florida State, 81-66, in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Connecticut, Mel Thomas and Charde Houston had 12 points each as the No. 7 Huskies (3-0) beat Boston University, 84-51.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Noteworthy</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg met Tuesday with the family of the man who was killed on his wedding day in a barrage of police gunfire as he left his bachelor party, and investigators questioned a third civilian witness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days after the fatal encounter, it remained unclear why four detectives and one police officer opened fire while conducting an undercover operation at a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified third witness was on a darkened block in Queens when five police officers killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and injured two friends as the three sat inside a car, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Bloomberg went to the Bell family's Queens church, where he met with the parents and fiancee of the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor stood by his comments Tuesday that officers appeared to use &quot;excessive force&quot; when Bell was killed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woman arrested, may have microwaved baby</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mother was arrested on suspicion of murdering her newborn daughter by microwaving the baby in an oven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China Arnold, 26, was jailed Monday on a charge of aggravated murder, more than a year after she brought her dead month-old baby to a hospital. Bail was set Tuesday at $1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have reason to believe, and we have some forensic evidence that is consistent with our belief, that a microwave oven was used in this death,&quot; said Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County coroner's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the evidence included high-heat internal injuries and the absence of external burn marks on the baby, Paris Talley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold was arrested soon after the baby's death in August 2005, then was released while authorities investigated further. Betz said the case was difficult because &quot;there is not a lot of scientific research and data on the effect of microwaves on human beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man dies month after a $1.1 million award</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who successfully sued a television station for naming him as a suspect in the BTK serial killings has died, a month after a jury awarded him $1.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Valadez, 66, apparently suffered a heart attack Monday evening at his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his death, the defamation verdict may be thrown out. Under Kansas law, decisions in libel cases do not survive the plaintiff's death, media attorney Mike Merriam said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, a jury found that Emmis Communications, owner at the time of KSNW-TV in Wichita, and news director Todd Spessard defamed Valadez for the coverage of his arrest on Dec. 1, 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valadez was never charged with the killings. Dennis Rader eventually confessed to all 10 killings from 1974 to 1991.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freshman Armon Bassett scored 16 to lead the Hoosiers (3-2), who were down 12 at halftime and had to fight for just about every basket but still put a scare into the Blue Devils. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, after Gerald Henderson's free throw, the Hoosiers had two late chances to tie. On the first, Bassett airballed a 3-pointer that went out of bounds to Duke.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Atlantic Coast Conference appears poised to win its eighth straight ACC-Big Ten Challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ACC took a 4-2 lead in the 11-game series by winning three of five games last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the ACC victories, however, was a surprisingly close 77-73 win by No. 21 Georgia Tech over unranked Penn State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 23 Maryland also earned a triumph for the ACC with a 72-66 victory over Illinois. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 11 Duke got the ACC's other victory last night, but the Blue Devils' 54-51 win over Indiana was not easy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Big Ten got wins last night by No. 12 Wisconsin over Florida State, 81-66, and by Northwestern over Miami (Fla.), 61-59.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Challenge started Monday with North Carolina State's 74-67 victory over Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final five games in the Challenge are set for tonight. The games are: Michigan State at Boston College, Virginia at Purdue, Iowa at Virginia Tech, Ohio State at North Carolina and Clemson at Minnesota. The ACC needs to win just two of those five games to again win the Challenge.<BR>ACC-BIG TEN CHALLENGE<BR>PSU HANGS TOUGH: At Atlanta, Lewis Clinch scored 20 points and Anthony Morrow's late free throws sealed the win for Georgia Tech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamelle Cornley led the Nittany Lions (4-2) with 20 points. Ben Luber, who added nine assists, hit two straight 3-pointers, the last coming with 44.4 seconds remaining, to keep Penn State close. Danny Morrissey's 3 from the left wing cut the lead to 74-71 with 21.1 seconds remaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nittany Lions had to monitor the minutes of star forward Geary Claxton, who came off the bench in just his second game since returning from a broken hand. Claxton had 30 starts in each of the last two seasons and averaged 15.2 points and 7.5 rebounds as a sophomore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 28 minutes, Claxton had 12 points and six rebounds. His layin with 3:58 remaining cut the lead to 67-61.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claxton is still limited,&quot; Penn State coach Ed DeChellis said. &quot;He has this thing on his hand and he can't shoot the basketball (effectively from the perimeter), and he can't drive it right-handed. We tried to get him around the basket. We tried to get him in the post.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nittany Lions fell to 1-16 against ranked opponents under DeChellis. Now in his fourth season at Penn State, DeChellis has a 5-28 overall road record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we have improved since a week ago when we played,&quot; DeChellis said. &quot;Is it a moral victory? No, it's still miserable. It's a loss, but I thought we did some positive things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRESHMAN LEADS TERPS: In Champaign, Ill., Maryland freshman Greivis Vasquez wasn't bothered by Illinois' loud homecourt that has been intimidating to visiting non-conference schools for eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terps teammate Mike Jones even likened the atmosphere to the raucous one at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuning out the orange-clad partisans, Vasquez and Jones helped Maryland end Illinois' 51-game non-conference winning streak at Assembly Hall dating back to 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not afraid. I'm ready for this,&quot; Vasquez said after scoring 15 of his 17 points in the second half as the Terps recovered after blowing a 15-point lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm from Venezuela, and I didn't come here just to sit on the bench. I came here to play,&quot; Vasquez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vasquez's steal and layup with 1:22 left to play gave the Terps the 65-60 lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Jones scoring 19 and Vasquez playing like an experienced veteran, Maryland was able to overcome the absence of shot blocker and rebounder Ekene Ibekwe, who sat out with an ankle injury. The Terps' 8-0 start is their best since the 1988-89 team won its first 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't feel like a hero,&quot; Vasquez said. &quot;I was just helping my team win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois (7-1) had 18 points from Shaun Pruitt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NELSON PACES DUKE: In Durham, N.C., DeMarcus Nelson scored 19 points as Duke held on to beat Indiana .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freshman Jon Scheyer had 10 points for the Blue Devils (6-1), who extended their nonconference home winning streak to 45 games and remained the only unbeaten team in the eight-year history of the Challenge. The win also gave Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski his 759th career victory, tying him with Western Kentucky's Ed Diddle for 10th on the all-time list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freshman Armon Bassett scored 16 points to lead the Hoosiers (3-2), who rallied from a 12-point halftime deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TUCKER SPARKS WISCON SIN: In Madison, Wis., Alando Tucker scored 22 points, including 18 after being poked in the eye, and Wisconsin beat Florida State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Badgers (6-1) took advantage in a physical game by capitalizing on sloppy play by Florida State (4-2), which turned the ball over 21 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kammron Taylor scored 18 points and Brian Butch added 13 for the battered Badgers. Toney Douglas scored 24 points, Jason Rich 12 and Al Thornton 10 for Florida State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOORE LEADS NORTH WESTERN: At Evanston, Ill., Craig Moore scored a career-high 24 points and Northwestern survived a late surge to beat Miami.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is leading the team in assists (26), steals (16), free-throw percentage (90.9) and points per game. The Marauders are 4-1.<BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg met yesterday with the family and fiancee of an unarmed black man killed by police gunfire outside a New York strip club on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50-bullet police volley - compared to a &quot;firing squad&quot; by the Rev Al Sharpton - killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after his bachelor party, wounded two of his friends and ignited concerns over police tactics. The three men were unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg went to the family's church in the borough of Queens and met with Bell's fiancee and father, and with Sharpton, a prominent civil rights leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor then met again with other community leaders at a restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor stood by his comments at a news conference that it was &quot;unacceptable or inexplicable&quot; how police could have fired 50-odd shots, but an investigation would determine what really happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seemed to me the number of shots fired, as I said, was excessive,&quot; he said. &quot;I wasn't there, maybe it will turn out to be not excessive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg said yesterday that he was steadfast in his support for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, despite demands from some community leaders that he step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the victims, Bloomberg said: &quot;There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong,&quot; referring to what led up to the moment their car struck an undercover officer outside the nightclub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard A Brown said his office was investigating the Saturday morning shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of Bell's friends were wounded after Bell's bachelor party at the strip club. The victims were black. The five police officers who fired shots included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic. The undercover operation at the Kalua Cabaret club was part of a citywide crackdown sparked by the case of a New Jersey teenager who was abducted, raped and killed following a night of partying earlier this year at a Manhattan nightclub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they had received several complaints about prostitution and drug dealing at the club in Queens before sending in two undercover detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation began to unravel when one of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officers alerted the back-up team outside that a man inside was possibly armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the undercover detectives retrieved his weapon and confronted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and his friends in their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly suggested it was unorthodox for the officer to blow his cover rather than rely on other officers to make the arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union officials insist the detective identified himself and ordered the men to stop before the car, driven by Bell, lurched forward and bumped him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vehicle then smashed into an unmarked police van, backed up and smashed the van again before the shooting began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, branded the officers &quot;murderers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Guzman, 31, was shot at least 11 times, Trent Benefield, 23, was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition and Benefield in a stable condition yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney has added her voice to a growing chorus of prominent Americans concerned about a spate of high-profile police shootings, including one that killed a New York man the day of his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congresswoman has asked the Justice Department to investigate police-involved shootings around the nation, including in her home district of DeKalb County, where police have fatally shot a dozen people this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a belief by some citizens that the police-involved shootings are steeped in the intentional use of excessive force, even deadly force,&quot; McKinney said in a Nov. 25 letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez. &quot;There definitely appears to be a developing national pattern of police misconduct and abuse resulting in an inordinately high number of serious injuries and deaths to the victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKinney has also asked the House Judiciary Committee to conduct hearings on &quot;the state of America's law enforcement agencies' use of force and deadly force and the impact on Americans on the basis of race and economic standing,&quot; her letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday that the shooting early Saturday of three unarmed men, in which 50 bullets were fired, was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who died in the shooting, was to have been married later that day.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd led by civil rights leader Al Sharpton protested in New York after police shot dead an unarmed black man on the day of his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of shots were fired by officers that also wounded two of 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> friends. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell was killed as he left a strip club on Saturday morning, hours before he was to marry the mother of his two young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those who were on the demonstration on Sunday called for the removal of the city's police commissioner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the vigil and rally, a crowd led by civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton shouted &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the crowd of a few hundred counted up to 50, the number of rounds that are estimated to have been fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; Sharp-ton said. &quot;We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.&quot; Some in the crowd called for the sacking of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, yelling &quot;Kelly must go&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's shootings happened around 4am outside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club where Bell's stag party was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car, driven by Bell, was struck by 21 bullets after the vehicle rammed an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD minivan. Other shots hit nearby homes and shattered windows at a train station, though no one else was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivors were Joseph Guzman, aged 31, who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, aged 23, who was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition and Benefield was stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers' group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care said it was issuing a vote of no confidence in Kelly. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAGHDAD, Iraq - Mortar rounds crashed into an oil processing facility near the northern city of Kirkuk on Monday, igniting a huge blaze, and a U.S. Air Force jet with one pilot crashed while supporting American soldiers fighting in Anbar province, a hotbed of Iraq's Sunni Arab insurgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire at the pipeline filtering facility shut down the flow of crude to the massive Beiji refinery to the southwest, according to an official at the North Oil Co., who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. The flames erupted at 6:30 p.m. and burned for several hours before they were extinguished, the U.S. military said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facility is 15 miles northwest of Kirkuk, a city that sits amid some of Iraq's richest crude oil deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Monday, a bomb exploded beneath an oil pipeline south of Baghdad and set it on fire, and Iraqi and American forces were deployed to secure the area, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No injuries were reported in the 7:30 a.m. blast near Mahmoudiya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad, said police 1st Lt. Haider Satar. The fire was put out about noon. The pipeline carries crude oil from storage tanks in nearby Latifiyah to the Dora refinery in Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert holds out hand in peace to Palestinians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM - Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached out to the Palestinians on Monday in one of his most conciliatory speeches yet, saying he was prepared to grant them a state, release desperately needed funds and free prisoners if they choose the path of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert's remarks sealed a dramatic policy shift and built on a day-old truce meant to end five months of violence in the Gaza Strip, but new rocket attacks by Palestinian militants threatened the latest rapprochement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hold out my hand in peace to our Palestinian neighbors in the hope that it won't be returned empty,&quot; Olmert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot change the past and we will not be able to bring back the victims on both sides of the borders,'' he said. &quot;All that we can do today is stop additional tragedies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert appealed to the Palestinians to form a new, moderate Cabinet committed to carrying out a U.S.-backed peace plan and securing the release of a captured Israeli soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once such a government was established, Olmert said, he would call for an immediate meeting with the moderate Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, &quot;to have a real, open, honest, serious dialogue between us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palestinian legislator Saeb Erekat, a top Abbas aide, said the Palestinians were ready to negotiate a final peace deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House says Iraq violence in 'new phase'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TALLINN, Estonia - President Bush intensified diplomatic efforts on Monday to quell rising violence in Iraq and Afghanistan, turning to allies as his national security adviser said the conflict in Iraq had entered &quot;a new phase&quot; requiring changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously everyone would agree things are not proceeding well enough or fast enough,'' National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley told reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew eastward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president was spending Monday night in this tiny Baltic nation ahead of a two-day NATO summit in Riga, Latvia, expected to deal with deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan, where NATO has 32,000 troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Estonia and Latvia are former Soviet republics that are strong allies in the war on terror.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident has provoked accusations of racism from the black and Hispanic communities in Queens, as well as calls for the sacking of New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed less than 36 hours before he was to have been married.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least seven plainclothes police officers were stationed in and around the club just after 4am on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and his friends were apparently involved in an argument as they left the club. One of the men allegedly yelled, ''Yo, get my gun'' before the groups separated and Bell and his friends got into their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five officers opened fire on the vehicle after it drove into an unmarked NYPD minivan. The officers' shots struck the men's car 21 times. Bell's friends were both hit, and one, Joseph Guzman, remains in a critical condition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg, who was in Bermuda when the shooting occurred on Saturday, returned to growing demands for an explanation as to why police fired 50 shots in under 30 seconds at the men's car as they left a strip club in Queens that they had visited for a stag party. The mayor said he was &quot;deeply disturbed'' by the barrage of gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, the driver, who was due to marry later that day, died after being hit in the neck and shoulder. He had been to the Kalua Cabaret, which undercover officers were investigating for suspected firearms and underage prostitution offences. Two other men in the car were wounded, one critically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting began after an officer investigating the club fired at the car when the men tried to run him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to some witness reports, the officer's shots passed through the car, convincing police on the other side of the vehicle that they were being shot at and prompting them to return fire. Raymond Kelly, the New York police commissioner, said 50 rounds were fired in a few seconds, 31 by one of the five officers involved. It was thought that the men in the car were armed after one was heard yelling outside the club &quot;Get my gun'', he said, but no weapon was recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg met community leaders yesterday and called for calm. &quot;It is unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired,'' Mr Bloomberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers involved have been placed on administrative leave while the district attorney investigates if criminal charges will be brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre, Mr Bell's fiancee and the mother of his two daughters, visited the shooting scene yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLACK police officers rounded on their chief last night as the crisis grew over the New York killing of a young groomtobe on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A powerful group called 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care issued a vote of no confidence in police chief Raymond Kelly as the tough Jamaica area of the city simmered with anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, which has grown to several thousand members since its launch in 1995, is made up of lawyers, police and probation officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid angry demonstrations, the city's billionaire mayor, Michael Bloomberg, flew from his Bermuda mansion to take personal control and meet black community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, died when police fired 50 shots at his car as he and a group of friends, all unarmed, left a nightclub after his stag party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of his friends were still in hospital last night. One is fighting for his life with 11 bullet wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg said he was 'deeply disturbed' by the tragedy. He told community leaders: 'It is unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Lester Williams, who had been due to marry Mr Bell and his childhood sweetheart Nicole Paultre, 22, said: 'It's like the Wild, Wild West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Fifty shots, and no one is shooting back at you? That's an execution. It's like putting these young men in front of a firing squad.' Demonstrators branded the police chief Machine- Gun Kelly because so many shots were fired in the 10 seconds of mayhem early on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reverend Al Sharpton, an activist and former presidential candidate, said: 'It's black victimisation again this would not have happened if the groom and his friends had been white.' He told a crowd: 'We cannot allow this kind of thing to continue to happen. We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.' Miss Paultre quietly visited the scene of the shooting before dawn yesterday. She lit candles placed around a photograph of her and Mr Bell smiling happily with one of their two daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Williams said: 'The family are in extreme shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young lady called me and said, &quot;Can I still be married?&quot;.' Mayor Bloomberg phoned Miss Paultre to express his condolences. He also contacted local councillor Leroy Comrie, who said: 'The mayor wanted to assure me we would get to the bottom of what happened.' Police refused to discuss the shooting because Queens District Attorney Richard Brown is investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He plans to take the case to a grand jury 'within days' to see if the officers involved should face murder or manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unofficially, police denied that race played a part in the shootings. Of the five policemen involved, one is a black Hispanic, two are Afro-American and two are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the white officers fired 31 bullets at the car, twice reloading his 9mm pistol with a new 15-round ammunition clip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said initially that the shooting began after Mr Bell drove his Nissan car at an undercover vice squad officer who had been part of a surveillanceoperation at the club, then rammed a van carrying other officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backup officers were said to have thought they were under fire from the people in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police sources said yesterday the bullets had in fact been fired by the undercover officer, on the other side of Mr Bell's car, and had gone straight through it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police version was also challenge by an eyewitness, however, deepening the anger in the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nightclub dancer Trini Wright, 28, told the New York Daily News: 'The police van came around the corner and smashed into their car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The cops jumped out shooting. There was no &quot;Stop!&quot; No &quot;Freeze.&quot; No nothing.' Mr Bell's cousin Kinglarry Crawford, 35, said Miss Paultre's father had been planning to buy the newlyweds a home 800 miles from New York in Atlanta, Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mr Bell had wanted to raise his children in a quieter area with more opportunities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN ANGRY crowd demanded today to know why police officers killed an unarmed man on the day of his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a vigil and rally the day after 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was supposed to have married the mother of his two young children, a crowd led by the black civil rights leader, the Reverend Al Sharpton, shouted ''No justice, no peace''. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the crowd of a few hundred counted off to 50, the number of rounds fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We cannot allow this to continue to happen,'' Mr Sharpton said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the wounded men was in a critical condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some in the crowd called for the ouster of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, yelling ''Kelly must go''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers' group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care said it was issuing a vote of no confidence in Kelly over the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the NYPD, said today, ''We are continuing to look for additional witnesses to shed light on the incident, and assisting the district attorney's office with its investigation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers had been placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, Mr Browne said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders planned a rally December 6 at police headquarters. The shootings occurred at about 4am Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club where Mr Bell's bachelor party was held. The survivors were Joseph Guzman, 31, who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, 23, who was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition today and Benefield was stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of all three men -- many of them stoic, and some crying -- attended today's vigil but none spoke publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said the department was still piecing together what happened, and that it was too early to say whether the shooting was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car, driven by Mr Bell, was struck by 21 of the police bullets after the vehicle rammed an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD mini-van.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">GRAPHIC: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo: Moshe Milner, Reuters , JERUSALEM Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached out to Palestinians yesterday in one of his most conciliatory speeches yet, saying he was prepared to grant them a state, release desperately needed funds and free prisoners if they choose the path of peace. Olmert's announcement followed a cabinet meeting in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Sde Boker on the annual memorial day for Israel's first prime minister, David Ben Gurion. Palestinian legislator Saeb Erekat, a top aide to moderate President Mahmoud Abbas, said Palestinians were ready to negotiate a final peace deal. But the Palestinian cabinet, led by Hamas militants who reject Israel's right to exist, accused Olmert of posturing.; Photo: Fatih Saribas, Reuters , TURKEY Pope Benedict, who arrives in Turkey today on a controversial visit, will enjoy tighter security than that accorded U.S. President George W. Bush in 2004. Some 3,000 police have been assigned to guard the Pope -- who angered Muslims worldwide with comments in September on Islam and violence -- on his arrival in the capital of Ankara. Police are also staking out spots in Istanbul, including St. Esprit Cathedral (the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit) shown here, where Benedict is expected to conduct a mass. Armoured vehicles and riot police will also be stationed near the areas the Pope is scheduled to visit during his four days in Turkey.; Photo: Javier Galeano, the Associated Press , CUBA Troops are massing for a huge parade in Havana, and guests are arriving from around the world to celebrate Fidel Castro's delayed birthday party. The only question is whether the ailing guest of honour, who turned 80 on Aug. 13, will appear for any of the five days of festivities starting today, giving clues to his health and ability to resume the power he held for 47 years.; Photo: Shannon Stapleton, Reuters , NEW YORK CITY New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said yesterday that police appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man in a weekend confrontation outside a strip club. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early Saturday after a bachelor party at the club. He was to be married later Saturday. Police, who were investigating alleged prostitution and drug use at the club, said Bell drove his car into an undercover officer and an unmarked police vehicle. Police policy states that officers cannot shoot at a vehicle being used as a weapon if no other deadly force is involved. The five officers involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave and stripped of their guns during the investigation.; Photo: Ward Perrin, the Canadian Press , VANCOUVER Vancouver-area residents braced for icy temperatures today as they continued to dig out from under a massive weekend snowstorm. Tree limbs downed by heavy snow have left thousands without power. And frustrated commuters faced a repeat of a disastrous morning after leaving their cars at home only to face jammed buses and trains. Forecast temperatures of -12 C to -25 C, put much of the Fraser Valley within frostbite range. Temperatures aren't expected to get above freezing for the rest of the week. The only good news yesterday was the lifting of a boil-water advisory for 900,000 people in the Greater Vancouver area after torrential rains 10 days ago overwhelmed treatment plants.; Photo: David Stonner, the Associated Press , MISSOURI Investigators are treating as suspicious a fire in a group home in Anderson, Missouri, that killed 10 of its mentally ill residents, and injured two dozen others. The dead ranged in age from early 20s to elderly. The blaze that broke out early yesterday stunned the rural community of about 1,800 people tucked in the Ozark hills about 55 kilometres south of Joplin.; Photo: Steve Parsons, the Associated Press , GREAT BRITAIN British Home Secretary John Reid has warned against rushing to conclusions over who might be responsible for the death of Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian spy turned Kremlin critic. An inquest has begun probing the death from what doctors said was poisoning by polonium 210, a radioactive isotope usually manufactured in specialized nuclear facilities. Three people were being tested for possible radiation exposure as officials began tracking radioactive hotspots in London to trace the poison.; Photo: Mark Baker, the Associated Press , AUSTRALIA Prime Minister John Howard declared himself vindicated yesterday after a probe cleared his government in an Iraqi oil-for-food scandal. But the inquiry urged charges against the nation's wheat exporter for paying more than $200-million US in kickbacks to then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of angry protesters shouted &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot; in New York on Sunday, demanding to know why police officers had killed an unarmed black man on the day of his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people at the vigil and rally called for the sacking of New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and many counted up to 50 - the number of rounds that are estimated to have been fired by police at three unarmed men in a car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bullets killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> early on Saturday, hours before he was supposed to marry the mother of his two young children. His two friends were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers have been placed on paid administrative leave and stripped of their guns, said New York Police Department chief spokesman Paul Browne. Police and prosecutors pledged a full inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, at the rally outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the two wounded men remains in a critical condition, prominent civil rights leader Al Sharpton insisted: &quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly says that police shot at the car after it drove forward and hit an undercover officer and an unmarked police minivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information was based on interviews with witnesses and two officers who did not fire their weapons, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But witness Trini Wright said: &quot;The minivan came around the corner and smashed into their car, adding that the police had &quot;jumped out shooting. No 'stop,' no 'freeze,' no nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said that it was unclear whether the officers, who were in plain clothes, had identified themselves before firing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an upside-down kind of police work, the opposite of the men and women in blue on sunny streets. There is no uniform, and often no gun, no badge, no bulletproof vest, no radio car with lights and sirens. Instead, officers drive rental cars and are armed with city-issued money and a two-drink limit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Undercover police work in the city's nightclubs is a dangerous and vulnerable assignment, the sort of work assigned to the new citywide Club Enforcement Initiative. That unit is under new scrutiny after a police shooting outside a Queens strip club shortly after 4 a.m. on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the police, five officers on the club detail shot into the men's Nissan Altima, killing a bridegroom and wounding two of his friends. The officers fired 50 rounds, the police said, after the men struck an officer with the car and twice slammed it into an unmarked police van. Officials have said the officers believed there was a gun in the car, but none was found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Club Enforcement Initiative was formed after a series of high-profile and violent crimes against people who visited city nightclubs this year, the police said, most recently the July 27 rape and murder of a woman, Jennifer Moore, 18, who was abducted along 12th Avenue after a night in bars and clubs. Her body was found in a garbage bin in New Jersey, near a hotel where the police say she was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under orders from the Organized Crime Control Bureau chief, Anthony J. Izzo, several officers from a Manhattan vice squad and the citywide narcotics office were assigned to the new detail, investigating nightclubs that were deemed chronic problems. The unit crossed the river to Queens and other boroughs after the situation in Chelsea stabilized, said Paul J. Browne, a police spokesman. New information from Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and interviews with former undercover officers described the unusual nature of the work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marq Claxton retired last year as a detective after 21 years with the department, and worked undercover narcotics operations in Brooklyn and Queens, sometimes unarmed and without a bulletproof vest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You have to really be prepared,'' Mr. Claxton said. ''You have to know when it's time to turn back around and get out. Sometimes you get a bad feeling.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Claxton is a spokesman for the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, which has criticized the shooting and raised questions about alcohol consumption on the job, suggesting that officers involved in shootings should undergo medical evaluations to test alcohol levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Club Enforcement Initiative, there are two teams of seven officers, said Julian Harper, a former lieutenant who retired in September and is familiar with the operation. Generally, two undercover officers work inside the club, or the ''set,'' while the others work outside as backup for an eventual arrest. The undercover officers are often unarmed, especially when there is a search for weapons at the door. This was the case on Saturday, when the undercover officers left guns, vests and badges outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officers are allowed two drinks. ''We authorize them to have two drinks, and no more,'' Mr. Kelly said at a news conference. ''This initiative started at one in the morning, so they were there for three hours.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To abstain from or refuse alcohol, said those familiar with the unit's tactics, could conceivably tip off other patrons that an undercover operation is taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officers are expected to carry hidden transmitters, disguised as pagers or cellphones, which allow them to communicate with the officers outside and record the night's events, Mr. Claxton said. ''You could have a cellphone that's really a transmitter,'' he said. It is unclear whether the officers in the club Saturday carried such devices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a routine operation, the undercover officers witness illegal activity, like prostitution or drug sales. ''You get into conversations with people who are inside,'' said, Mr. Harper, the retired lieutenant. ''You see if there's anyone dealing drugs. You make agreements with prostitutes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officer then alerts the officers outside, and ideally, leaves the set, thereby preserving his or her cover while the suspects are arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This was not the case on Saturday, when one undercover officer, suspecting the men had a gun, left the club and armed himself before following </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the bridegroom who was killed, and his friends to their car and ordering them to stop, then firing. Mr. Kelly conceded yesterday that such behavior by an undercover officer was unusual, but officials said it was not unheard of. What had started as an investigation of drugs and prostitution now focused on firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least one of the two undercover officers inside the bar had had two beers between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m., Commissioner Kelly said. That officer was one of the two who did not fire in the shooting. Five officers from the team of seven fired at the Altima. One officer with 12 years of experience fired 31 rounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The other undercover officer fired the first shots. Those familiar with that officer's account have said he believed the men were armed. It is unclear if that officer drank in the club. The police have not yet been able to question him while the Queens district attorney conducts an investigation, Mr. Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A commanding officer found all the officers fit for duty -- meaning they showed no signs of being impaired by alcohol -- during the operation outside Club Kalua in Jamaica, the police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Claxton said money for the drinks is given to the officers before the operation, and the bills are photocopied, so that all remaining bills can be accounted for later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not unusual in vice details for the other officers on the team to enter the set to see a suspect firsthand, and in doing so, have a drink, the former undercover officers said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The retired officers said it is the discomfort and the feeling of aloneness that keep some people from going into the undercover details. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everybody's not undercover,'' Mr. Harper said. ''Some people can do it. It can be kind of hairy.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much has changed in New York since Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was killed in a hail of 41 bullets fired by city police officers in 1999. Mr. Diallo's death sent racial tensions in the city nearly to a boiling point -- helped along by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who regularly shunned meetings with black leaders and failed to treat the crisis with the urgency it required. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, are dealing differently with their own Diallo-style disaster. Police officers firing 50 rounds early last Saturday killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an unarmed man who was to have married his high school sweetheart later in the day. The mayor and the commissioner moved quickly to answer questions and to hear the concerns of the victim's family and the community. But their responsiveness will not bring back </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge here is far greater than good communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers who killed Mr. Bell were part of a sting operation at a Queens nightclub suspected of narcotics, prostitution and weapons violations. According to published reports, the officers have said that as Mr. Bell and his friends left the club and headed toward their car, an undercover detective heard one of them say he was going to get a gun. They also reportedly said that when the men entered the car, the detective pulled his gun and identified himself, but the car suddenly gunned forward, hit him in the shin and then struck an unmarked police minivan. The officers then opened fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tragedy may simply involve two sets of very frightened men who reacted instinctively to what they thought was imminent danger. But only one of the sets was armed. There was no gun in the car, nor on the shooting victims, who sat helpless inside while five police officers began firing 50 rounds at them. One emptied his gun, a 9mm semiautomatic, reloaded and emptied it again, accounting for 31 rounds. The shooting appears to have been frantic, with bullets shattering windows as far away as the AirTrain station, hundreds of yards from the scene. Two of Mr. Bell's companions were injured; miraculously, there were no other casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unlike the Diallo tragedy, the officers involved in the Queens shooting were not all white. They were also not inexperienced. The first bullet came from an officer with five years on the job, and the detective who fired the 31 rounds had 12. But it is hard to explain their actions as anything but panic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police rules mandate that an officer pause after firing three rounds to assess the situation. If the shooters had followed procedures, they might have seen there was no threat before it was too late. Mayor Bloomberg has rightly called for a quick and impartial investigation. The officers must be held accountable for what has happened. But the Police Department must also confront the fact that a disaster that everyone swore to prevent seven years ago has repeated itself in Queens. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a vestibule leading to the Blue Room, the ceremonial parlor of City Hall, the countenances of former mayors gazed from the walls upon all who passed yesterday. There they were, the men who led New York across five decades: Wagner and Lindsay, Beame and Koch, Dinkins and ----</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hold on. The last previous mayor was not there. Circumstances have delayed the completion of his portrait, his representatives said; nothing more should be read into his absence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rudolph W. Giuliani's absence was conspicuous yesterday, not only in the vestibule but also more substantively in the Blue Room itself. Gone -- exorcised, really -- was the hardness that pre-9/11 was his default position in moments of civic anguish, a rigidity that earned him at least as many detractors as admirers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the unarmed Amadou Diallo was killed in 1999 by four police officers who fired 41 shots, Mr. Giuliani failed to grasp that whatever the wrongs or rights of the case, the collective New York hand needed a reassuring mayoral pat. Instead, it got a leader who stood in the Blue Room alone, lashing out almost Lear-like at his critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That mayor, in every respect, was absent yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his place stood Michael R. Bloomberg, who understood that flexibility of the spirit does not necessarily mean weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Something terrible happened over the weekend in Queens. Another unarmed man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed, and two other men were wounded by plainclothes police officers who fired not 41 shots but 50. The number boggled the mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AND so, while insisting that an investigation must take its course before judgments are rendered, Mr. Bloomberg articulated the bafflement that many New Yorkers felt over an event that, plain and simple, didn't smell right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It sounds to me like excessive force was used,'' he said, adding minutes later, ''It's hard to understand why 50-odd shots should be taken.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given that difference in tone from 1999, this mayor did not have to stand alone in the Blue Room. He was surrounded by elected officials and clergymen from Queens, all African-Americans, like Mr. Bell. For a symbolically important photo, the mayor was briefly joined by two men who were never invited to the Giuliani City Hall: the Rev. Al Sharpton and City Councilman Charles Barron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the interest of reaching out, Mr. Bloomberg chose to overlook remarks made by Mr. Barron, a former Black Panther, who came awfully close on Sunday to threatening violence against the police. If the city doesn't respond to the Bell case, ''don't ask us to ask our people to be peaceful while they are being murdered,'' said Mr. Barron, ever the statesman. ''We're not the only ones that can bleed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is true. Police officers also can bleed, not that Mr. Sharpton or Mr. Barron is known for speaking out when the spilled blood is blue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Did they call a rally after two black undercover detectives, James V. Nemorin and Rodney J. Andrews, were shot in the back of the head in 2003 while trying to rid the streets of guns? What do you think? Even as the killing of Mr. Bell held center stage, a Staten Island man went on trial yesterday in the detectives' murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps one result of the latest disaster will be a reordering of police undercover procedures. The Diallo case led to changes. But it may be worth noting that the New York police do not typically shoot at anything in sight, despite some of the overheated oratory heard in the last few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By any measurement -- number of shooting incidents, number of rounds fired, number of civilians shot or wounded -- police officers reach for their guns far less often than they did 10 years ago. And 10 years ago, under Mr. Giuliani, the numbers were well below those of previous decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the early 1970s, an average of 63 civilians a year were shot to death by the police. The figure for 1996 was 30. Last year it was 9. Before the Bell episode, the 2006 total was 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, statistics get you only so far. Inevitably, something like Mr. Bell's death reinforces a perception among some New Yorkers that the police are trigger-happy and the ones who pay, almost always, are black men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bloomberg said he did not believe that the latest shooting was racially motivated. Yet many people, he acknowledged, sense ''a pattern that is unacceptable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I find that pattern unacceptable as well,'' he said yesterday in the Blue Room, exorcised of the spirit that once held sway there.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg convened an extraordinary meeting of black religious leaders and elected officials at City Hall yesterday to calm frayed tempers over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in Queens, calling the circumstances ''inexplicable'' and ''unacceptable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It sounds to me like excessive force was used,'' the mayor said of the conduct of the officers, who fired 50 shots outside a Queens nightclub early Saturday, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, hours before he was to be wed, and injuring two others. ''I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloomberg made the remarks after meeting with some of the city's most influential black politicians and community leaders, including Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Rev. Al Sharpton and dozens of others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mayor's decision to meet with Mr. Sharpton and other black leaders was a stark turnabout from the approach of Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who did not reach out to black leaders in the immediate aftermath of the fatal 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who died in a hail of 41 police bullets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Bloomberg's blunt assessment of events still under investigation was striking, although he took pains to point out that the facts were not all in, saying several times that he did not yet know what happened in the shooting, but that he expected that a grand jury would be impaneled by the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a move that suggests the officers feel their actions were justified, the lawyer representing the men said he had contacted Mr. Brown's office and offered to have the officers speak to prosecutors and appear before a grand jury voluntarily without immunity. The police have not released the officers' names, saying they are trying to protect them from retaliation or harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Philip E. Karasyk, who is a lawyer for the Detectives' Endowment Association, said, ''We feel confident that once all of the facts and circumstances of this tragic incident are known, then our detectives will be exonerated.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This was a tragedy, but not a crime,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown said in a statement that he intended to convene a grand jury to hear evidence in the case. While Mr. Karasyk has represented the four men who are detectives in the preliminary stages of the investigation, three of the four will get new lawyers, possibly as soon as tomorrow, because each must have his own and it remains unclear whether they will pursue the same strategy. The fifth man, an officer, has different representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Participants at the private meeting at City Hall, which included Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and several high-ranking Bloomberg aides, described the discussions as frequently heated, with the mayor sitting next to leaders whom he counts as supporters. Those more critical of the administration's response to the shooting, including Mr. Sharpton and City Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn, sat on the opposite side of the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bloomberg's approach of reaching out to community leaders has drawn praise, and he plans to go to southeast Queens today to meet with community leaders there. But his efforts have left some unconvinced that the underlying conflicts between the police and predominantly black communities are being addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We prefer talking than not talking, but the object is not a conversation, the object is fairness and justice,'' Mr. Sharpton said as he left City Hall. ''Because we're not just interested in being treated politely, we're interested in being treated fairly and rightly. And that will happen when police are held as accountable as anyone else.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bloomberg pledged to do just that, saying that the city would review its policies and training procedures to ensure fair treatment, but he added that he did not believe that the shooting was racially motivated. Of the officers who fired on Mr. Bell's car, two are black, one is black and Hispanic, and two are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I do not at this point believe that there was anything racially motivated here, but we'll wait and see whatever the facts are,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''A lot of people feel that this on top of other incidents that have happened in the past is a pattern that is unacceptable. I find that pattern unacceptable as well,'' Mr. Bloomberg continued, adding that he saw the shooting as an isolated case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong,'' he said of the men who were shot, referring to the moments leading up to the confrontation with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some policies appear to have been violated in the shooting, which occurred when, according to the police, undercover officers fired 50 bullets at Mr. Bell's car after he drove into one of the officers and an unmarked police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officers are trained to shoot no more than three bullets before pausing to reassess the situation, Mr. Kelly said in his most detailed assessment of the shooting yet. Department policy also largely prohibits officers from firing at vehicles, even when they are being used as weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although several of the leaders at City Hall expressed confidence in the mayor and the police commissioner, the emotional meeting, which began with outbursts of anger and ended calmly, laid bare some of the rifts among New York's black leaders themselves. Some expressed support for the mayor's handling of the case or refrained from criticizing him. Many, however, expressed concerns that the administration was failing to deal with what they described as continuing tensions between black residents and police officers even when the officers are not white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There were some heated exchanges,'' said the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, an influential Pentecostal minister in Brooklyn. ''We all agree that there is a pattern of police abuse of power, and this abuse of power ranges from police killing to police brutal behavior to disrespect. We reiterated that over and over again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Daughtry warned the mayor not to confuse patience with complacency. ''There is a temperature in our communities that is rising, and the tension is intensifying,'' he said. ''While we don't want to try to ignite anything, we'd be blind to overlook what's happening and not to sound the alarm.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But other leaders played down the anger in the room, saying that some participants seemed determined to bring up past history or to pursue agendas with little bearing on this specific case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's always anger after incidents like this and there's always a lot of people that bring up other incidents,'' said City Councilman Leroy G. Comrie Jr. of Queens. ''People confuse history, and specific people are concerned about their individual actions.'' He added: ''You have different people that don't know each other, there's always room dynamics, you know, because people come in with different agendas or some people are off topic altogether.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shooting happened as the police were undercover in the club, Club Kalua, to investigate reports of prostitution and drug dealing. There was a dispute outside between two groups of men, and one group of three or four left. One undercover officer followed them, believing they might have been going to get a gun before returning to the club. In the officers' version of events, the undercover officer confronted the men in Mr. Bell's silver Nissan Altima, and they tried to run him over, prompting the fusillade from him and his backups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the leaders expressed dismay over Mr. Kelly's revelation that one of the undercover officers had had two beers in the course of the operation inside the nightclub, but was not given a breath analyzer test. Mr. Kelly said that undercover officers are allowed the two drinks and are not normally tested for intoxication. He said they were deemed fit for duty by their superior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the office of Mr. Brown, the Queens district attorney, will oversee the criminal inquiry, the tactics employed by the detectives and their supervisor during the events leading up to the shooting and the shooting itself will also be reviewed by the Police Department. Several people who have been briefed on the detectives' version of events raised questions about their tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For instance, they said that one undercover officer who had been inside the club without his weapon retrieved it from a police vehicle and then engaged the men in the Altima, even though that task should have been left to the backup team. Mr. Kelly said that sequence of events was unusual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saying there was a ''grave crisis'' of confidence in his southeast Queens community, Bishop Lester Williams, who was to have performed Mr. Bell's wedding, said there had been no improvement in police-community relations since the height of tensions under Mayor Giuliani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's Little Iraq, I'm sorry, especially toward the blacks in the community,'' he said before attending the meeting. ''We don't feel protected.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But others said that Mr. Bloomberg had made some progress simply by setting a new tone. ''Just the simple fact of meeting, or discussion, or expressing concern and outrage on the part of this administration, was different,'' said Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., the city's top black elected official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly after 5 p.m., many of the same black leaders who had attended the meeting with Mr. Bloomberg went to a briefing at the Queens County Courthouse with Mr. Brown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, 22, the mother of their two daughters, arrived with her father and Mr. Bell's mother, Valerie, and uncle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nearly two hours later, Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Bell's family left, pushing past reporters without saying anything. Several other civic leaders said the meeting had been emotionally difficult, with Ms. Paultre and Ms. Bell bursting into tears. The civic leaders declined to discuss the meeting's specifics, but said they were satisfied with what they had heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While officials met and discussed the case, Mr. Bell's father, William, 53, stood by his house on a quiet, suburban street near Cambria Heights and said that they were all missing the point. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's more about politics than human life,'' he said. Mr. Bloomberg has spoken with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fiancee and said he plans to visit the family soon, but William Bell said none of the officials had reached out to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At least they could say 'I'm sorry,' '' he said. ''Say 'I'm sorry, I'm going to find out what's going on.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's gone,'' he said of his son. Then, patting over his chest, he added, ''Not here in my heart he's not gone, but he's gone.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days after police shot and killed an unarmed man in Queens, critics are questioning police procedures for undercover investigations and city officials indicated that the shooting could lead to policy changes in the police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, said that the procedure followed by the undercover detective who first opened fire at the club in Queens was &quot;unusual.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover detective who was investigating possible illegal activity at the Kalua Cabaret did not carry a gun or badge when he entered the club because a bouncer was patting down bar-goers, but retrieved them later and later confronted a group of men who he suspected were going to use a gun in a dispute. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By confronting the men himself, the detective apparently violated police protocol which usually calls for an undercover officer to let back-up officers in uniform arrive. Instead, the detective made first contact, which Mr. Kelly said was &quot;unusual.&quot; Police experts said the policy of having uniformed police make arrests insures that suspects know that they are dealing with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelly said that when an undercover detective suspects a gun may be involved, the detective can take the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover detective jumped on the roof of the car wearing a badge around his neck, but it is not clear if the detective identified himself as a police officer or if the men in the car recognized him as one. The car, which struck the officer, then reversed into a shuttered garage before crashing again into the minvan, prompting four detectives and one police officer to fire a fusillade of 50 bullets at the car, hitting it 21 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All five officers who fired their weapons, including an officer with 12 years on the job who fired 31 shots, have been stripped of their weapons and placed on administrative leave while the Queens District Attorney investigates the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, who was celebrating his bachelor party and planning to get married on Saturday, was killed. He had four bullet wounds. Joseph Guzman, 21, was hit by 11 bullets and was listed in critical, but stable condition. Trent Benefield, 23, was in stable condition with three bullet wounds. No weapon was found in the car or at the scene, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kelly disclosed that one of the two undercover detectives who didn't fire his weapon had drunk two beers at the bar over a period of several hours to blend in with the crowd. The commissioner said that he didn't know if the detective who opened fire had been drinking, because the police aren't allowed to interview the officers until the district attorney finishes the investigation. It is standard police policy to allow undercover officers to consume two drinks, Mr. Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of shots fired was also contrary to police training, Mr. Kelly said, in which officers are taught to fire three shots and then stop and assess the threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average number of shots fired in a police incident for the year through November 19th was 3.8, down from 5.04 for the same period in 2005, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor said the shooting &quot;seemed excessive&quot; and questioned why police fired &quot;50 odd shots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the Detectives Endowment Association, Michael Palladino, criticized the mayor, saying: &quot;So much for withholding judgment before all the facts are in. I think his comments unfairly taint the entire situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's lawyers are representing the four detectives involved in the case, Mr. Palladino said. &quot;I think it is important to point out that we have contacted the Queen's District Attorney's office, and our detectives are anxious and ready and willing to be interviewed by the district attorney's office and testify before the grand jury in an effort to get the facts of the story out,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former police officer, Eugene O'Donnell, who is a professor of police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the incident would likely result in a &quot;top-down&quot; review of procedures involved in vice operations. The detectives involved in the incident were part of a citywide task force to reduce crime at nightclubs and shut down establishments that turn a blind eye toward wrongdoing. The Kalua Cabaret had a record of allowing prostitution and drug consumption, police said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg's response to Saturday's police shooting is dividing black leaders, with some demanding immediate action and others urging patience while an investigation takes place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloomberg yesterday said it seemed as if &quot;excessive force&quot; had been used in the killing of an apparently unarmed man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was leaving a strip club in Queens at 4 a.m. on the day he was to have been wed. The mayor met yesterday for two hours with more than 30 clergy and elected officials in an effort to quell anger over the shooting, in which police fired 50 bullets at a car driven by Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After leaving the meeting, participants staked out varying positions. On one end was the radical City Council member Charles Barron, whose call for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly to resign faced derision from others who attended the meeting. On the other end stood the city's comptroller, William Thompson Jr., and the incoming state Senate minority leader, Malcolm Smith, who each praised the mayor's initial steps and pledged to wait for the results of an investigation by the Queens district attorney, Richard Brown, before calling for specific changes in police policy or leadership. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference after the meeting, Mr. Bloomberg deferred to Mr. Brown's investigation while also offering his own impressions. &quot;It is, to me, unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that is up to the investigation to find out how that actually happened,&quot; the mayor said as he stood surrounded by many attendees of the meeting, including Rep. Charles Rangel; the City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, and several clergy members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am, to put it mildly, deeply disturbed,&quot; Mr. Bloomberg later added. The mayor will travel to southeast Queens to meet with community leaders this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In immediately reaching out to black leaders and the community, Mr. Bloomberg has struck a markedly different tone from that of his predecessor, Rudolph Giuliani, who battled often with the Rev. Al Sharpton and other black leaders. The mayor's response going forward will be a test of what has been one of his administration's top achievements: continuing the steady drop in crime while repairing the fractious relations that developed between predominantly black and Hispanic communities and City Hall. Those tensions peaked with constant protests at police headquarters following the death in 1999 of Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant who was shot 41 times by officers in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton, a longtime foe of Mr. Giuliani and a chief critic of police policies, said yesterday that Mr. Bloomberg's politeness was hardly enough. &quot;This mayor has better manners than his predecessor. Let's see if we have better policies,&quot; Rev. Sharpton said outside City Hall after attending the meeting with Mr. Bloomberg. &quot;We prefer talking than not talking, but the object is not a conversation. The object is fairness and justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton later met with the Queens district attorney, Mr. Brown, and said he was convinced that the police officers who killed Bell and wounded two others had acted &quot;beyond the law.&quot; Citing a pattern of &quot;disrespect, disregard, and absolute unfairness in our community,&quot; Rev. Sharpton said he told Mr. Bloomberg: &quot;Imagine, Mr. Mayor, living in a city where you have to live with the fear of the cops and the robbers. Some in the city worry about the robbers. We have to worry about both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton did not, however, echo Mr. Barron's call for Mr. Kelly to resign. Neither did most of the participants at yesterday's meeting. Mr. Thompson, a likely candidate for mayor in 2009, said: &quot;I don't think many people joined in that. I certainly don't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Barron said he asked the mayor directly for a &quot;regime change&quot; at the meeting. &quot;Everybody thought that was silly,&quot; the public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, said afterward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his news conference in City Hall, Mr. Bloomberg backed Mr. Kelly in the strongest possible terms. &quot;I have complete confidence in our police commissioner,&quot; the mayor said. &quot;He will be the police commissioner for the rest of my term. I think he is the best police commissioner the city has ever had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While expressing anger at Bell's death and the lingering animosity between police and minority communities, black leaders who attended yesterday's summit also stressed caution. Council Member James Sanders had joined in chants of &quot;Kelly must go&quot; at a vigil in Queens on Sunday, but after meeting with Mr. Kelly and the mayor, he apparently backed off that stance. &quot;I think it's too early to call for his resignation,&quot; Mr. Sanders said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Thompson issued a statement saying he was &quot;stunned and outraged at what appears to be a horrific and unjustified use of force by the police,&quot; but earlier in the day he praised the Bloomberg administration. &quot;What could have been done by this administration has been done right now,&quot; he said outside City Hall.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Mayor Dennis Walcott's primary job is to oversee the Department of Education and several other city agencies, but as the senior African American member of the Bloomberg administration and as a resident of southeast Queens, Mr. Walcott is playing a key role in handling Mayor Bloomberg's response to this weekend's fatal shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walcott got a call about the shooting - which left an apparently unarmed 23-year-old groom dead after police fired 50 shots - early Saturday morning. The deputy mayor and his wife had been getting ready to host a surprise 90th birthday for his aunt at their home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr. Bloomberg reportedly out of town, Mr. Walcott was the face of City Hall at the crime scene and then at Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens, where he spoke with the mother of the victim, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bell was to have been wed later in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Walcott, whose own son was shot in the leg earlier this year, said he was in &quot;constant contact&quot; with the mayor on Saturday and Sunday and that he was in touch with Rev. Al Sharpton and other community leaders throughout the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a Southeast Queens resident,&quot; Mr. Walcott said during a telephone interview.&quot;I have extensive contacts with both elected and community leaders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The beauty of our staff is that we are all team members and we are able to fit into a variety of areas,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to being the key liaison at a meeting yesterday morning between Mr. Bloomberg and more than 30 elected leaders and clergy members, Mr. Walcott made the rounds with interviews on the hip-hop radio station POWER 105 and an appearance on NY1, where he repeatedly highlighted the mayor's immediate outreach to the community. That note was sounded throughout the day and seemed designed to squelch comparisons between this latest police shooting and the Amadou Diallo shooting of 1999, when Mayor Giuliani waited to gather community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was not the Mr. Walcott's first time playing cheerleader and primary point man for Mr. Bloomberg. After the shooting of Timothy Stansbury Jr. by police in 2004, Mr. Walcott served as an a key mayoral emissary, visiting the victim's family and, according to the Daily News, bringing a plate of jerk chicken. He served a similar role the year before when a Harlem woman died after a botched police raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interview with POWER 105 radio host Ed Lover, Mr. Walcott, said his background is part of what he offers. &quot;I had my son, who was shot at one point, not by police, but by others in the street,&quot; Mr. Walcott said. &quot;So I bring, I think, a different perspective as far as people who have seen it from different angles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, a variety of African American leaders praised Mr. Walcott. The city's comptroller, William Thompson Jr., said the deputy mayor was &quot;very effective.&quot; And, City Council Member Robert Jackson, the co-chairman of the Black, Latino, and Asian caucus, said Mr. Walcott's history as head of the New York Urban League, which he ran for 12 years, offered &quot;credibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others said he could be more effective. Council Member Charles Barron, an outspoken critic of the Bloomberg administration, said: &quot;Dennis can be more effective,&quot; and should exert &quot;more influence on the mayor after the meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, when asked about Mr. Walcott, Rep. Charles Rangel, the Harlem Democrat who is the dean of New York's congressional delegation, said: &quot;I have some issues there that I don't want to discuss publicly.&quot; He did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stricken young fianc&eacute;e yesterday silently lit white prayer candles at the site where her unarmed boyfriend was shot dead by cops -  and later bitterly wept as she called the officers &quot;murderers&quot; who trapped and &quot;executed&quot; him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre, 22, quietly went to the spot in the middle of Liverpool Street in South Jamaica, Queens, before dawn and stood amid shards of car-window glass left by the cops' bullets that killed her high-school sweetheart.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then lit the candles, which were left near a beaming photo of her, Bell and the oldest of their two girls, Jada.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked on a radio program later what she would say to the five cops who unloaded 50 bullets on Bell and his friends as they tried to flee in their car early Saturday, on what would have been her wedding day, Paultre fought back tears as she responded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, I would start by not referring to them as officers. They are murderers. They are not officers,&quot; she told Power 105.1's &quot;Egypt and Ashy in the Morning.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaking her silence for the first time since Bell's death, Paultre added:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one gives anybody the right to kill somebody, to take someone's life. They don't know what they've done, what pain they've caused this family, my kids.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pretty mom then broke down in sobs for several moments before mumbling &quot;sorry&quot; and adding:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They barricaded him in, and they executed him.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre was supposed to marry her 23-year-old lover later that day in front of family and friends.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bell wound up shot after his bachelor party at a strip club when undercover cops, thinking his group had a gun, pounced on them and launched into a shootout among themselves, catching the groom-to-be in the crossfire.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know it was wrong,&quot; Paultre said. &quot;He [Bell] did nothing wrong.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fresh-faced mom said she first learned something may have happened to her fianc&eacute; when a relative called her.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't tell me what happened, just to come, come to the hospital. And that was it,&quot; she said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I showed up . . . they still wouldn't tell me anything,&quot; she said of authorities. &quot;Everything was completely messed up. I waited over an hour in the emergency-room waiting area just to find out what happened, what condition he was in.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre said one of the hardest things she's had to do since Bell's death is tell Jada, 3, that her father isn't coming home.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to explain that Daddy's with God, Daddy's an angel now,&quot; the mom said, breaking down again.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She knows all about prayers, so she was actually kind of happy when I explained it to her . . . We may not be able to see him, but he's here, shining on us, he's watching us.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre -  who spoke along with Bell's cousin, Marilyn Bell, an editor at Black Elegance magazine -  urged all New Yorkers to attend a rally Dec. 6 at One Police Plaza in downtown Manhattan.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want everybody to come out because this is not just my fianc&eacute;e and Marilyn's cousin and Mr. and Mrs. Bell's son,&quot; Paultre said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This could be anybody. This could be anybody's son, anybody's husband, anybody's father.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marilyn Bell spoke lovingly of her cousin, calling him generous and devoted to his family.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sean was a loving young man. He adored Nicole. He adored his daughters,&quot; she said.       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre's mother, Laura Paultre, visited the memorial dedicated to Bell later in the day and took a photograph of it, although she acknowledged, &quot;It doesn't help. I feel worse.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have been his mother-in-law, and they murdered him in cold blood. And he was only trying to go home.&quot;       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Bell's pals took issue with reports detailing his criminal past. Bell had been arrested three times: twice for drugs and once on a gun charge, although the case was sealed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't add up to 50 shots, regardless,&quot; the man said.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, the rattle of NYPD gunfire heralds a tragedy. Once again, rabble-rousing advantage-seekers ply their corrosive trade.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five cops fired 50 rounds outside a sleazy Queens strip-joint early Saturday morning, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - a 23-year-old black man who was to be married that day - and injuring two other African-Americans, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened?   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg cautions that an investigation is underway - and then, stunningly, indicts the cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It sounds to me like excessive force was used,&quot; Bloomberg said yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, it sounds to us as if Mayor Mike needs to hold his horses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, 50 shots are a lot. Happily, the probe is in more judicious hands: Queens DA Richard Brown can be trusted to pull no punches.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as the probe proceeds - and as was the case with the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999 - it must be remembered that as a matter of law, cops have an explicit right to use deadly force if they are in reasonable fear for their lives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is true regardless of any department regulations on the use of force.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary reports suggest such a fear was indeed reasonable, given that Bell apparently drove his car into an undercover cop. And that officers on the scene thought the men might have had a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, the deadly shooting in this case, as in all others involving cops firing their weapons, must be judged in context:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Start with the fact that the cops were probing a skeezy dive in Queens called Club Kalua. Their investigation was part of an NYPD operation called Club Enforcement Initiative, launched after the gruesome rape and murder of 18-year-old Jennifer Moore in July.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kalua certainly seems a choice target, following reports of drug and gun violations and prostitution at the club.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All three men had arrest records (even if cops didn't know it at the time): Bell had been nabbed twice for drugs and once on a gun rap; Guzman, nine times, including for armed robbery, and Benefield for gun possession and robbery.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An undercover cop reportedly heard Guzman say, &quot;Yo, get my gun.&quot; Before firing, the officer demanded to see the men's hands - a clear sign he thought they might have a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* As their car lurched forward, hitting him and a police minivan, the officer reportedly yelled, &quot;He's got a gun.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the attention, alas, has been focused on the fact that 50 shots were fired. Certainly, that seems a large number.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is reason to believe that in the confusion of the moment some officers believed that they had come under fire and - quite reasonably - retaliated.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's that word again: reasonable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this context, of course, matters to folks like Rev.-on-the-Spot Al Sharpton, or racial revolutionary City Councilman Charles Barron.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday Sharpton said, &quot;Some in the city have to worry about the robbers. We [in the minority community] have to worry about both&quot; cops and robbers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is utter nonsense.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Events such as Saturday's tragedy are big news precisely because they're so rare. In any event, as Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said yesterday, police shootings per capita in New York City are lower than in most other large cities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sharpton's almost pro forma protestations pale compared to Barron's vile race-mongering: &quot;I'm not asking my people to do anything passive anymore,&quot; Barron snarled.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't ask us to ask our people to be peaceful while they are being murdered. We're not the only ones that can bleed.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bleed?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was execrable rhetoric of that sort that made the sight of Bloomberg rubbing shoulders with Sharpton and Barron at City Hall so shocking.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'd think the Bloomberg folks had already done enough to show good faith and outreach to minorities - what with all the speeches Kelly's made at black churches and his quick admission that another cop's shooting, which killed Timothy Stansbury in 2004, was unjustified.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly, of course, can be counted on to do the right thing this time, too.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As can DA Brown.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Bloomberg, we expect, is operating in good faith - even if he does have ants in his pants.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so Sharpton, Barron and the rest of their ilk. It would be unreasonable to expect otherwise.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, or ever. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops who unleashed a fatal, 50-bullet barrage on an unarmed Queens groom used &quot;excessive force&quot; that was &quot;unacceptable,&quot; a grim-faced Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday - even as he urged New Yorkers not to rush to judgment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who fired 31 of those shots was 12-year-veteran Detective Mike Oliver, who was photographed yesterday by The Post leaving his lawyer's downtown office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his harshest criticism ever of police during his mayoralty, Bloomberg acknowledged that even though the probe into the racially charged shooting is ongoing, &quot;It's hard to understand - keep in mind I was not there at the time - why 50-odd shots should be taken.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, that sounds excessive and unacceptable,&quot; the mayor admitted to reporters at City Hall after an at-times tense, closed-door powwow with elected officials and black community leaders outraged over the killing.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you that it is unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, asked last night on NY1 if he agreed that excessive force was used, said only that the mayor is &quot;entitled to his opinion.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was set to marry his high-school sweetheart and mom of their two young daughters on Saturday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was cut down in a police undercover operation gone horribly awry only hours earlier, after he and his pals left a seedy strip joint in South Jamaica.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover officers involved in the shooting say they thought a man in Bell's group had a gun when one tried to stop him in his car outside the club, sources have said. Then, after Bell began ramming his Nissan Altima into one of the plainclothes cops, the officer started firing - and set off a deadly exchange of bullets between him and confused backup detectives who thought the gunfire was coming from the victim's car.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver told investigators he hadn't realized how many shots he had fired. He said when that when he emptied his first clip, he thought the gun had jammed after he squeezed off only a couple of bullets. So he quickly reloaded and emptied the new clip. The officer had never before fired his weapon in the line of duty. In fact, a source said, he'd been shot at years ago and did not fire back.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown is set to impanel a grand jury to investigate the incident, which has already led hundreds to take to the streets to protest the officers' actions and demand that Kelly resign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was black, as are his two friends who were wounded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver is of Syrian-Lebanese descent; his colleagues at the scene were two blacks and two whites.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg said that even if Bell's car was being used as a weapon against the cops, it was against NYPD policy to fire at it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The procedure is that you don't fire at a car if the car is being used as a weapon,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether or not the police had reason to believe that there was a gun involved, I don't know.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any event, he said, up until the point Bell struck the undercover with the Altima, &quot;There is no evidence that they [he and his friends] were doing anything wrong.&quot; Kelly said officers are taught not to fire more than three shots at a time without pausing to assess the situation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's something we stress all the time,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;This is part and parcel of our training.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting has already been compared to one of the city's most infamous fatal police slayings: that of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo. The innocent black man was shot 19 times in his Bronx by four white cops, who thought he was reaching for a gun when he was only fumbling for his wallet. The officers were acquitted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five cops in the latest shooting have been placed on administrative leave - stripped of their guns - while the probe continues.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Oliver, the other four cops had never before been involved in a shooting, officials said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical examiner said Bell was hit four times and died from wounds to the neck and torso.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been at the forefront of those calling for action against the cops, briefly stood onstage with the mayor after their meeting - then left before Bloomberg spoke.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later called the session &quot;very candid,&quot; adding that his contingent's message to the mayor was:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many other black leaders flanked Bloomberg as he spoke, although some vowed to punish the city if justice is not served.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're making sure that the actions of these police officers are addressed the way they should be,&quot; said Edward Williams, a friend of Bell's family and the president of the NAACP's Far Rockaway branch.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't expect to allow this to be another Amadou Diallo case and just move the venue and just let folks walk. We don't expect that, but if they do, they will hear from all over the city like they've never heard before.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams particularly homed in an NYPD regulation that permits undercover officers to drink on duty if it helps them blend in.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said one undercover cop had two beers in the club and was not given a Breathalyzer because &quot;we normally don't do that.&quot; Kelly added that the commander on the scene made an assessment that all the officers were fit for duty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harlem Rep. Charles Rangel, who attended the session with Bloomberg, hailed the mayor for reacting quickly to the crisis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest shooting &quot;reminds me of a tragedy that took place with Mr. Diallo. And we can't have that. We can't have that,&quot; Rangel said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton added, &quot;This man [Bloomberg] has better manners than his predecessor. Let's see if we have better policy.&quot; But Bloomberg was quickly castigated by police-union officials who accused him of rushing to judgment.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Premature statements made without the benefit of all of the facts only serve to inflame tensions and prejudice the rights of those who are presumptively innocent.&quot; Lynch's sentiment was echoed by the union representing detectives. &quot;In this particular situation, the amount of shots were not excessive,&quot; said Detective Endowment Association President Michael Palladino. &quot;They were having deadly physical force used against them.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino said the detectives in the case were so firm in their resolve that they were willing to testify before the grand jury without immunity.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   NEW YORK - Calling the hail of police gunfire that killed an unarmed man and wounded two others &quot;unacceptable,&quot; Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached out to angry community leaders.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,&quot; Bloomberg said  yesterday at a news conference after meeting with elected officials and community leaders including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Rep. Charles Rangel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg said bluntly that officers appeared to use &quot;excessive force&quot; when 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Two of the groom's friends were wounded in the shooting Saturday following a bachelor party at a strip club. Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, the officers fired 50 rounds into the men's vehicle. The three were unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   As anger simmered in the community over the weekend, Bloomberg - who was reportedly out of town and had been in touch by e-mail and phone - invited local leaders to city hall yesterday for a  meeting with him and police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev.  Sharpton called it a &quot;very candid&quot; meeting. He said the message to Bloomberg was: &quot;This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a mayor to question the actions of the officers and defend the shooting victims - while reaching out  to the grieving community - sets a decidedly different tone than in the past. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani was hounded for what some viewed as a slow response to the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times in the Bronx by four white officers. The shooters were later acquitted of criminal charges. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- Within the next 25 years, AIDS is set to join heart disease and stroke as one of the top three causes of death worldwide, according to a study published online Monday. When global mortality projections were last calculated a decade ago, researchers assumed the number of AIDS cases would decline. Instead, it's on the rise. Currently ranked fourth behind heart disease, stroke and respiratory infections, AIDS is set to become No. 3, say researchers in a report in the Public Library of Science's Medicine journal. It accounts for about 2.8 million yearly deaths. But the researchers estimate a total of nearly 120 million people could die in the next 25 years. Overall, researchers predict that in three decades, the causes of global mortality will be strikingly similar worldwide -- apart from the prevalence of AIDS in poorer countries. Most people will be dying at older ages of noninfectious diseases such as cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DOJ probes own eavesdropping role</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- After months of pressure from congressional Democrats, the Justice Department's inspector general, Glenn Fine, said Monday his office had opened a full review into the department's role in President Bush's domestic eavesdropping program and the legal requirements governing the program. Democrats said they saw the investigation as a welcome step that could answer questions about the operations and legal underpinnings of the program, which allows the National Security Agency to monitor, without getting court warrants, the international communications of Americans and others inside this country with suspected terrorist ties. Fine informed members of Congress in a letter he was opening an investigation after the White House had agreed to approve the necessary security clearances for members of his staff.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Parliament accepts Quebec as nation</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TORONTO -- Parliament formally recognized Quebec as a nation within Canada on Monday, a symbolic gesture that has led to a Cabinet resignation and ignited concerns over a renewed push for the French-speaking province's independence. The motion presented by Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, which calls Quebec a nation within a united Canada, is largely symbolic in that it requires no constitutional amendment or change of law. The opposition Liberals and New Democrats supported the motion, so it passed easily through the House of Commons.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court to allow Times record check</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled against the New York Times on Monday, refusing to block the government from reviewing phone records of two Times reporters in a leak investigation of a terrorism-funding probe. The one-sentence order came in a First Amendment battle involving stories written in 2001 by Times reporters Judith Miller and Philip Shenon. The stories revealed government plans to freeze the assets of two Islamic charities, the Holy Land Foundation and the Global Relief Foundation. Like the CIA leak investigation into who revealed the identity of Valerie Plame, the current Justice Department probe is being conducted by Patrick Fitzgerald, who is prosecuting Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff in the Plame case.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Health officials say flu vaccine plentiful</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- There's still time to get a flu shot. Federal health officials reminded people Monday that the flu season usually doesn't peak until February or later. There's more than enough vaccine to go around. Demand for flu shots typically tapers off after Thanksgiving. A record 110 million to 115 million flu shots are expected to be available this year; millions are likely to be discarded at the end of the flu season. The shots are brewed fresh before each season to match the strains of the flu virus expected to be most prevalent, and cannot be saved year to year.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">NYC mayor calls shots unacceptable</SPAN><BR></P>

The total cost of items gifted by a True Love who repeats all of the song's verses costs more than ever before -- $75,122 -- for all 364 items, up from $72,608 in 2005, a 3.5 percent increase.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton called it a &quot;very candid&quot; meeting. He said the message to Bloomberg was: &quot;This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.&quot; Some have also questioned whether the shooting was racially motivated because the victims were all black men. The five officers who fired their guns included two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the victims, Bloomberg said yesterday: &quot;There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong,&quot; referring to everything leading up to the moment they struck the officer with their car.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gunfire in the current case stemmed from an undercover operation inside the Kalua Cabaret, where seven officers in plain clothes were investigating alleged prostitution and drug use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has said the groom was involved in an argument outside the club after 4 a.m., and one of his friends made a reference to a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover officer walked closely behind Bell and his friends as they headed for their car. As he walked toward the front of the vehicle, they drove forward, striking him and an undercover police vehicle, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer who had followed the group on foot was apparently the first to open fire, Kelly said. One 12-year veteran fired his weapon 31 times, emptying two full magazines, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg also said police appeared to have violated the policy stating that officers cannot shoot at a vehicle being used as a weapon if no other deadly force is involved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blast was felt a mile away and sent debris through the walls of some of the other homes, police and neighbors said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary John Reid, speaking in the House of Commons, called for calm during the investigation of the death of Litvinenko, 43, who died Thursday from exposure to radioactive polonium 210.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haniyeh planned the tour, which was to have begun today, in part to help replenish his government's empty coffers. It was to have been his first trip abroad since the militantly anti-Israel Hamas took office in March, provoking crushing international economic sanctions on the Palestinian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip was delayed after Israel said security conditions didn't permit Europeans monitoring the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt to cross from Israel into Gaza, the European mission and Palestinian officials said.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A natural gas leak was suspected as the cause of the blast just after noon, though there were no complaints of gas odors before the blast and no work crews were in the area, said Columbia Gas spokesman Matt Pitzarella. Gas service to homes near the explosion was shut off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blast was felt a mile away and sent debris through the walls of some of the other homes, police and neighbors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Castle is about 45 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Henry and Jared Baker, both in their early 30s, were hospitalized, Henry in critical condition and Baker in serious condition, a hospital spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MURDER SUSPECT RUNS THROUGH SCHOOL: A murder suspect ran through an elementary school Monday in Columbis, S.C., as he fled police trying to arrest him, and schools in the area were locked down while officers tried to find him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was inside Watkins-Nance Elementary School only briefly, entering through the front and running out a rear door, Richland County sheriff's spokesman Chris Cowan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police didn't know whether the man was armed, but he was considered dangerous, Cowan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers had gone to a nearby house with arrest warrants for two men wanted in a killing during an apparent robbery at a motel last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAYOR BELIEVES POLICE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE: Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in Monday on the uproar over a deadly police shooting in New York, saying bluntly that officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man in a confrontation outside a strip club hours before his wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,&quot; Bloomberg said at a news conference after meeting with elected officials and community leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Rep. Charles Rangel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early Saturday after a bachelor party at the strip club. Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, police fired 50 rounds into the vehicle. The men were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DELIBERATIONS START IN SMUGGLING CASE: A jury began deliberating Monday in Houston to determine the fate of a truck driver whom a prosecutor called &quot;vile and heartless&quot; for his role in the nation's deadliest human smuggling attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyrone Williams is being retried in the deaths of 19 illegal immigrants who prosecutors say were among more than 70 illegal immigrants stuffed into his sweltering trailer. They said he ignored their pleas for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people did not have to die. There is only one reason they're dead, and he sits right over there,&quot; Assistant U.S. attorney Daniel Rodriguez said in closing arguments. He pointed at Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense attorney Craig Washington said that Williams is guilty only of transporting illegal immigrants and that he had no idea people were dying in the trailer and never meant them any harm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCE FOUND IN OFFICES: Traces of the radioactive substance responsible for the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko have been found in two downtown London offices, and three people who aren't feeling well have been referred for tests to determine if they might also have been exposed, officials said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Secretary John Reid, speaking in the House of Commons, called for calm during the investigation of the death of Litvinenko, 43, who died Thursday from exposure to radioactive polonium 210.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reid said that about 500 people have called government hotlines established following Litvinenko's death, and that only &quot;a small number&quot; had been referred for testing as a &quot;very precautionary measure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PALESTINIAN LEADER DELAYS FIRST TRIP: Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, of Hamas, has postponed a tour of Muslim countries because of Israeli travel restrictions, his office said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haniyeh planned the tour, which was to have begun today, in part to help replenish his government's empty coffers. It was to have been his first trip abroad since the militantly anti-Israel Hamas took office in March, provoking crushing international economic sanctions on the Palestinian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip was delayed after Israel said security conditions didn't permit Europeans monitoring the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt to cross from Israel into Gaza, the European mission and Palestinian officials said. Without the monitors, the passage doesn't operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BLAIR SORROWFUL ABOUT SLAVE TRADE: British Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned the African slave trade and expressed deep sorrow Monday for his country's role - but stopped short of offering an apology or compensation for the descendants of those victimized by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activists are pressuring Britain to offer an apology - and reparations - for its role in slavery before it marks the 200th anniversary of the law that banned the country's participation in the Atlantic slave trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair wrote in an article in the New Nation newspaper that it was right to recognize the active role Britain once played in the trafficking of human beings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Video:   Bloomberg Holds Meeting Over NYPD Shooting </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg weighed in on the uproar over a deadly police shooting, saying bluntly Monday that officers appeared to use excessive force when they fired 50 shots at an unarmed man in a confrontation outside a strip club hours before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50-odd shots fired, but that's up to the investigation to find out what really happened,&quot; Bloomberg said at a news conference after meeting with elected officials and community leaders including the Rev. Al Sharpton and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was killed and two of his friends wounded early Saturday after a bachelor party at the club. Suspecting that one of the men had a gun, undercover police fired into their car after it hit one officer. The men were unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton called the meeting &quot;very candid.&quot; He said the message to Bloomberg was: &quot;This city must show moral outrage that 50 shots were fired on three unarmed men.&quot; Some have also questioned whether the shooting was racially motivated because all the victims were black. The five officers who opened fire were two blacks, two whites and one Hispanic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the victims, Bloomberg said Monday, &quot;There is no evidence that they were doing anything wrong,&quot; referring to everything leading up to the moment they struck the officer with their car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High court says U.S. can see reporters' phone records WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled against The New York Times on Monday, refusing to block the government from reviewing telephone records of two Times reporters in a leak investigation concerning an examination of terrorism funding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-sentence order came in a First Amendment battle that involves stories written in 2001 by Judith Miller and Philip Shenon, then reporters for the Times. The stories revealed the government's plans to freeze the assets of two Islamic charities, the Holy Land Foundation and the Global Relief Foundation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald is trying to identify the reporters' confidential sources for the stories. Fitzgerald's spokesman, Randall Samborn, declined to comment on the Supreme Court's order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute stems from Shenon and Miller calling the two charities for comment after learning of the planned freeze on their assets from confidential sources. The Justice Department says the reporters' calls tipped off the charities that they would be raided. A federal judge who ruled in the Times' favor said there was no evidence in the case even suggesting that the reporters tipped off the charities about the raids or that the reporters even knew the government would raid either charity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in August that federal prosecutors could see the two reporters' phone records. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FBI to examine shootout that killed woman, 88 ATLANTA -- The FBI will lead the investigation of the shootout between plainclothes police officers and an 88-year-old woman who was killed in her home, which was suspected to contain drugs, Police Chief Richard Pennington said Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three officers were wounded when they entered Kathryn Johnston's home looking for cocaine based on tips from an informant, according to the search warrant released Monday by the Fulton County State Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the informant told officers he had purchased drugs in the home, prompting investigators to get a warrant. But Pennington said it was unclear whether there had been a drug deal or whether the suspected drug dealer exists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven narcotics investigators and a sergeant were placed on paid leave until the inquiry is complete, Pennington said. The informant is in protective custody and will be a key part of the investigation, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Medical Examiner's Office also reported Sunday that records show Kathryn Johnston was 88, despite her family saying she was 92. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massachusetts to sue Big Dig contractors after fatality BOSTON -- The state of Massachusetts will file a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against companies that worked on a Big Dig highway tunnel, claiming that their negligence led to the ceiling collapse that killed a woman in July, the state's attorney general, Tom Reilly, said Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reilly said he would seek unspecified damages for repairs, loss of tunnel use and toll revenue and other economic factors in a lawsuit to be filed Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the suit would name 15 firms involved in the management, design, construction or oversight of the Interstate 90 tunnel, but only one -- the project manager, Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff -- would face the more serious claim of gross negligence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm knew early on about problems with the epoxy bolt system used to secure 4,500-pound cement ceiling panels but still turned over the tunnel to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority in 2003 without warning of the &quot;potentially dangerous situation,&quot; Reilly said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the concrete panels fell onto a car July 10, killing a passenger, Milena Del Valle, 39, of Boston. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Device to prevent clot-forming heartbeat being tested WASHINGTON -- At least 120,000 Americans a year suffer strokes because of a common irregular heartbeat -- one that's on the rise, hard to treat and can shoot deadly blood clots straight to the brain. Now doctors are experimenting with a new way to prevent those brain attacks: a tiny device that seals off a little section of the jiggling heart where the clots form. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it works -- and a major study is under way -- the Watchman device might provide long-needed protection for thousands of people with atrial fibrillation, whose main hope now is a problematic blood-thinning drug that too many can't tolerate. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK Nov. 27</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again a hail of police bullets has ended the life of an unarmed black New Yorker, and the city's mayor finds himself walking an uncertain line between reassuring black and Latino residents and defending his police force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With a City Council member saying that black people are being &quot;murdered&quot; and some black clergy signaling their discontent with Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (R), who is white, walked into a news conference Monday and spoke of his profound unease with the  shooting by undercover police that claimed the life of a bridegroom on his wedding day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I can tell you that it is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50 shots fired,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;It sounds to me that excessive force was used, but that's up to the district attorney to find out.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a visible symbol of Bloomberg's concern, he was accompanied by a number of prominent black pastors and politicians, including activist preacher Al Sharpton and Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.). The night before, Sharpton journeyed to the Community Church of Christ in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens and vowed that he was going to &quot;keep this in the street.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shooting occurred early Sunday morning as an undercover officer trailed three men  --   </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23  --   as they left a bachelor party at the Kalua Cabaret club in Jamaica.  The trio had argued with two men inside the club and left, trying to avoid trouble, witnesses said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officer told the three men to stop, although witnesses differ about whether the officer identified himself and flashed his badge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bell and his friends, witnesses told the New York Daily News, feared that the undercover officer was a friend of those they had argued with and that he was carrying a gun. The men tried to pull away in their car, scraping the leg of an officer. An officer fired a shot, and four more officers pulled out their 9mm guns and began shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Three bullets fatally struck Bell, a delivery man and father of two, who died just hours before his marriage ceremony was to take place. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Benefield and Guzman were injured; the latter had 11 bullet wounds. None of the three men carried a gun, and police manacled the two survivors as they lay bleeding, a fact that concerned civil libertarians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's not as if people so seriously wounded were a flight risk,&quot; said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. &quot;Yet they were treated as criminals for having gotten shot by the police.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelly offered a carefully calibrated defense, noting that the Hispanic officer who opened fire was a 12-year veteran and apparently thought the car was trying to hit him. Three of the five officers who fired shots were black or Latino.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kelly's spokesmen released data showing that New York officers now fire 40 percent fewer shots per incident than in 1995. Police killed 30 people in 1996, compared with nine in 2005 and 10 so far this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maki Haberfeld, a John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor and specialist in the use of deadly force, said she was not inclined to second-guess officers operating under stress at night. &quot;There are distorted perceptions of time and motion, and fear and adrenaline, and it takes 20 seconds to fire 50 shots,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm taken aback by how the mayor indicted these officers. How could he know?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But such arguments and statistics soothed few nerves, particularly for those who live in neighborhoods with a history of frayed relations with the police. Sunday's shooting called to mind the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, in 1999. Diallo, a peddler and student, was returning home when undercover police officers told him to stop. He panicked and officers fired 41 shots, 19 of them hitting Diallo. His death came to symbolize the unsightly underbelly of then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's war on crime. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That history was very much alive in the minds of residents on the streets of Jamaica on Monday. Theirs is a prosperous lower-middle-class neighborhood with vibrant shops, the crack-fueled crime of 10 years ago a fading memory. Yet many said police officers still pat down young men for guns and stop cars with little reason. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The demeanor when they talk to people  --   they have a nasty attitude,&quot; said Wayne Johnson, 43, a car-service driver. &quot;They'll come and see us talking on the corner and say: 'What you doing here?' They think everyone is a drug dealer.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monique Holley, 23, attends the nearby Queensboro Community College and has passed her exam to become a police officer. Monday, she found herself struggling with second thoughts. &quot;If I become a cop, how would people look at me? That's what I am debating today.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bloomberg enjoys far better relations with the city's black leaders than Giuliani did. There was no more visible evidence of this Monday than the presence at the news conference of the rhetorically flammable Sharpton, who was persona non grata at City Hall throughout the Giuliani era.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Americans, Sharpton said on a radio show after the news conference, appreciate that the city's crime drop means that their neighborhoods are safer and that many young men are alive who might otherwise have died in violent crime. But he said that peace carries an unacceptably high price tag. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I told the mayor, 'Yes, we want crime down. Yes, crime is higher in many of our communities than elsewhere,' &quot;  Sharpton said. &quot;But it's worse to have to live in these neighborhoods and be afraid of the cops and the robbers.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York mayor 'disturbed' by killing NEW York's mayor said it appeared 'excessive force' was used when an unarmed black man was gunned down by police in a hail of bullets on the eve of his wedding. Black community leaders called on Michael Bloomberg and police commissioner Ray Kelly to show 'moral outrage' as they met the officials after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death at the weekend. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bloomberg said he was 'deeply disturbed' by the incident, which left two of the 23-year-old's friends injured, adding that it was 'unacceptable or inexplicable' to him how officers could have unleashed 50 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged prosecutors to carry out their investigation as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISRAELI Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached out to the Palestinians yesterday in one of his most conciliatory speeches yet, saying he was prepared to grant them a state, release funds and free prisoners if they choose the path of peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I hold out my hand in peace to our Palestinian neighbours in the hope that it won't be returned empty,' Olmert said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We cannot change the past and we will not be able to bring back the victims on both sides of the borders,' he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lilly Ledbetter sued Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., claiming that after 19 years at the company's Gadsden, Ala., plant, she was making $6,000 a year less than the lowest-paid man in the same job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists offer insights into death of King Tut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO (MCT) - When Egyptian scientists performed the first CT scan of the mummy of Tutankhamun, they turned up a key clue: Bone fragments from the pharaoh's first vertebra, near the skull, were not coated with embalming fluid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the fragments were clean at the breaks, meaning that the damage had to have occurred after the pharaoh's remains were prepared for burial. The evidence seems to rule out a blow to the base of the skull as the cause of Tut's death, a theory in play ever since X-rays of the boy king were taken in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's likely the bones broke when Englishman Howard Carter and his team rough-handled the mummy after they discovered it in 1922, said Dr. Ashraf Selim, who reported the first detailed findings from the scans Monday at the Radiological Society of North America's annual meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reached out to the Palestinians on Monday in one of his most conciliatory speeches yet, saying he was prepared to grant them a state, release desperately needed funds and free prisoners if they choose peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olmert's remarks sealed a dramatic policy shift and built on a day-old truce meant to end five months of violence in the Gaza Strip. But new rocket attacks by Palestinian militants threatened the latest rapprochement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day his honeymoon was to have started, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> memory and the manner of his death - shot many times by New York police - dominated the latest outcry against city officers' use of deadly force against an unarmed black man. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people held a vigil for Mr Bell on Sunday, some shouting &quot;No justice, no peace&quot; and demanding the sacking of New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many counted off to 50, the number of rounds estimated to have been fired by police at Mr Bell, 23, and two other unarmed men in a car early on Saturday - hours before he was to have married the mother of his two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers were placed on paid administrative leave and stripped of their guns, said chief spokesman Paul Browne for the New York Police Department. Police and prosecutors promised a full investigation, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly were planning to meet with community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of that stemmed the fury of a community outraged by the shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; the Rev Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights leader, said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the two wounded men was in critical condition..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly has said that police shot at the car after it drove forward and struck an undercover officer and an unmarked police minivan. The information was based on interviews with witnesses and two officers who did not fire their weapons, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shootings occurred after 4am on Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret in the borough of Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kelly said the confrontation stemmed from an undercover operation by seven officers investigating the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell was struck twice. Joseph Guzman, 31, was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, 23, was hit three times. Mr Guzman was in critical condition yesterday and Mr Benefield was said to be stable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday in a case that could determine whether the Bush administration must change course in how it deals with the threat of global warming. A dozen states as well as environmental groups and large cities are trying to convince the court that the Environmental Protection Agency must regulate, as a matter of public health, the amount of carbon dioxide that comes from vehicles. Carbon dioxide is produced when fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas are burned. It is the principal ``greenhouse'' gas that many scientists believe is flowing into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate, leading to a warming of the earth and widespread ecological changes. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">LEXINGTON, S.C.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c8">Bet leads to slaying</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journey home at the end of the long Thanksgiving weekend was smooth sailing for many travelers Sunday as the weather cooperated and more people had scheduled their flights to avoid the rush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travelers across most of the nation had dry and relatively mild weather for their drives and flights home, except for freezing temperatures on the northern Plains and gray, slushy weather in parts of the Pacific Northwest. Chicago's temperature edged above 60 degrees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midday crowds also weren't as bad as expected at Boston's Logan International Airport. People are spreading out Thanks-giving travel plans over several days instead of hitting the airport all at the same time, said Danny Levy, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Logan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Retailers got what they wanted over the Thanksgiving weekend - a strong start to the 2006 holiday shopping season as consumers crowded stores in search of huge discounts on flat-screen TVs and other hot merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stores and malls that opened as early as midnight Friday drew a bigger-than-expected turnout, and robust sales for the first day of the season offset slower business as the weekend wore on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest winners appeared to be electronics chains such as Best Buy Co. Inc. and popular-priced department stores including J.C. Penney Co. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which had promised its most aggressive discounting ever, said same-store sales for November will be slightly below its already lackluster forecast.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK police officers shot dead an unarmed man on the day he was due to get married as he left his stag night at a strip club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers fired about 50 rounds at a car in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his friends were travelling after the vehicle crashed into an unmarked police van. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, 23, who was driving, was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital after being shot in the neck arm and shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been due to marry the mother of his two young daughters hours later. Instead, Nicole Paultre, 22, was driven to a New York hospital to identify the body of her high school sweetheart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other men in the car were also hit, one 11 times. Raymond Kelly, the New York police commissioner, said it was too early to say if the shooting was justified. The district attorney's office is investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident stemmed from an undercover police operation inside the Kalua Cabaret, a strip club in Queens, Mr Kelly said. The club, which had a &quot;chronic history of narcotics, prostitution and weapons complaints'', was one violation away from being shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At around 4am, there was an altercation outside the club in which one man was heard shouting: &quot;Yo, get my gun.'' Police followed a group of men as they got into a car and drove off. It was thought they were armed, Mr Kelly said, but no weapons were found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell and his friends apparently did not realise the plain clothes officers were police and fled. The officers opened fire after the men twice rammed an unmarked NYPD van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spray of bullets hit the car 21 times. One officer fired his gun 31 times, emptying two full magazines, Mr Kelly said. He would not say whether the collision was what prompted the officers to open fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A train station and nearby homes were also hit but no residents were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Guzman, 31, who was in the front seat and shot at least 11 times, was critical in hospital. Trent Benefield, 23, was hit three times and described as stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four officers were treated at hospital for minor injuries. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting by New York police has sparked fury in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spray of bullets hit the car 21 times, after the vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and then an unmarked police minivan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Front-seat passenger Joseph Guzman, 31, who is in a critical condition in hospital, was shot at least 11 times, while Trent Benefield, 23, a passenger in the back seat, was hit three times.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted that one veteran officer fired 31 shots, emptying two full magazines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City mayor Michael Bloomberg said: &quot;Officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, died in a hail of bullets after police fired 50 rounds at his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His two passengers were critically injured after being hit multiple times during the shooting in the early hours of Saturday morning prompted after the stag-night revellers struck a police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Guzman, 31, was hit 11 times and Trent Benefield, 23, three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three were found to be unarmed and the incident has provoked an outcry from their families and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, who has two babies, aged three and five months, had been due to get married hours later that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His fiancEe, instead of getting married in front of 250 people, spent the weekend at the bedside of the injured men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting took place after an undercover operation at a lap-dancing club called Kalua Cabaret in the borough of Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven officers were staking out the club which was under investigation for drugs and prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed one of the undercover police overhead a remark 'get my gun' from one of the trio inside the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three men later got into a car and as Mr Bell was driving away he struck an officer on foot it is thought by accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car backed up onto the pavement and hit a police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers then jumped out and opened fire .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One, a veteran of the NYPD, fired his 9mm handgun 31 times, emptying two magazines. Some of the bullets hit nearby houses and a train station, but no passers-by were injured.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING (AP) - Explosions in two Chinese coal mines have left at least 53 workers dead and six missing, China's Xinhua News Agency and safety officials said Sunday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both blasts occurred the same day and together represent the highest reported death toll for one day in China's notoriously dangerous mines in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first occurred Saturday in the Yuanhua Coal Mine in Jixi, a city in northeastern Heilongjiang province, Xinhua said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Sunday, the remains of 21 miners had been found, while six miners were still missing, Xinhua said. Four managed to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the southwestern province Yunnan, the death toll from a gas explosion in a shaft in Fuyuan county rose overnight from 20 to at least 32 miners as rescuers found more bodies, Xinhua said. Another 28 miners were injured in the blast, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community outraged over fatal shooting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his fiancee had already shared a high school romance, then two children. In the early hours of what was to be their wedding day, the reception hall lay waiting, covered in satin and adorned with balloons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ceremony never occurred Saturday. Police shot 50 rounds at the groom's car as he drove away from his bachelor party, killing the 23-year-old hours before he was to walk down the aisle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hail of gunfire at a car full of unarmed men drew an outcry from family members and community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers' shots struck the men's car 21 times after it rammed into an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD minivan, police said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said it was too early to say whether the shooting was justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One man dies on Calgary's frigid streets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CALGARY (CP) - Despite the best efforts of city officials and volunteers to provide emergency shelter for Calgary's homeless as a severe cold snap hit the city, one person was found dead on the street early Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insp. Steve Barlow said the cause of death has not been confirmed, but the weather could have been a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man was found by a passerby, who called paramedics. He was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cat, dog, exotic snake and six people escape Calgary house fire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CALGARY (CP) - Six people - along with a cat, a dog and an exotic snake - are homeless after a fire ripped through a home Saturday, sending clouds of black smoke into the cold winter sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter Christie was watching television with his 16-year-old daughter around noon when she said she thought she smelled something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natasha Christie rushed to get their dog, Chyna, out while Christie ran back into the house to alert his downstairs neighbours and rescue his cat and a 1.7- metre royal ball python named Zeus, who was attempting to break out of its cage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christie got on the phone with a fire dispatcher who advised him to drop to the floor and crawl toward any voice he could hear - in this case Natasha.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WALLACE and Gromit scooped a children's Bafta to add to their clutch of awards. Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit won the feature film category at the British Academy Children's Film and Television Awards. The absentminded inventor and his dog fended off competition from The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police shoot man on wedding day THERE were calls today for the sacking of New York's police commissioner after officers killed an unarmed black man on his wedding day and wounded two friends. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, who had been due to marry the mother of his two young children, was shot at 4am on Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret strip club. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally yesterday led by civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton, the crowd called for the removal of Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. A police spokesman said: &quot;We are continuing to look for additional witnesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five officers are on paid leave pending an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man dies after fight over parking A MAN died after a fight with one of his neighbours over a parking space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Rolfe, 60, suffered a heart attack after he came to blows with another man during a row outside his house in Aldershot. Neighbours said there had been frequent arguments in the cul-de-sac where both men lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resident said: &quot;Parking around here causes a lot of grievances because people get constantly blocked in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabbies have toughest job in UK DRIVING a taxi in London is Britain's most difficult job, according to Discovery Channel show Hard Labour which conducted eight months of research. It says cab driving is far more stressful than working on a Scottish trawler in the North Sea, chopping trees in the Great Yorkshire Forest or drilling for oil off the coast of the Shetlands. A spokesman for Discovery Channel said: &quot;Navigating dangerous roads all day is seriously underestimated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metroline bus strike is called off A STRIKE set for today at one of London's busiest bus companies has been called off after bosses agreed to drivers' pay demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transport &amp; General union has already staged two 24-hour walkouts and had threatened more, including today, unless Metroline increased its original five per cent offer. But at the last minute the company agreed to boost hourly and weekend pay by 6.5 per cent - twice the inflation rate. The revised offer will go to a new ballot this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afghan suicide blast kills three A SUICIDE bomber attacked a convoy of foreign troops in southern Afghanistan today, killing two Canadian soldiers and an Afghan civilian, police said. The car bomb also injured a second civilian and killed 15 camels being herded by a group of nomads, Kandahar police chief Ismatullah Alizai said. A spokesman for Nato's International Security Assistance Force said two soldiers had been killed but did not release their nationalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News in brief Humpbacks have human neurons HUMPBACK whales have a type of brain cell seen only in humans, the great apes and other cetaceans such as dolphins. The finding of this cell, the spindle neuron in the cortex, may help explain whales' abilities to form alliances, co-operate, and use tools, say researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Spindle neurons probably first appeared in the common ancestor of hominids, humans and great apes about 15 million years ago.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York authorities were scrambling to contain an angry backlash yesterday after police shot a group of three unarmed black men, killing one of them on his wedding day. The shooting took place after a stag party at a strip club in Queens, a few hours before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was due to marry the mother of his two small daughters. He was struck in the neck and arm and was dead on arrival at hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of his friends, Joseph Guzman, was in a critical condition after being hit 11 times, and another, Trent Benefield, was in a stable condition with wounds to his leg and buttocks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage at the shooting was compounded when it emerged that Mr Guzman and Mr Benefield had been shackled to their beds. New Yorkers have also been startled at the apparent wildness of the fusillade. The police claim to have overheard one of three men mention a gun, but no weapon was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers on the scene fired a total of 50 bullets, but fewer than half hit the intended target, a car carrying the three men, despite being fired at close range. The rest sprayed nearby cars and buildings, as local residents leapt out of bed and huddled on the floor. One of the stray bullets shattered a window at a train station in the neighbourhood, injuring two transport police officers with flying glass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting quickly became political with the appearance of community leaders - including the Reverend Al Sharpton, the black civil rights leader who has led previous protests against police brutality - alongside the victims' relatives outside the hospital where the wounded men were being treated. &quot;I will stand with this family,&quot; Mr Sharpton said. &quot;This stinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, urged patience, saying it was too early to draw conclusions. &quot;We know that the officers on the scene had reason to believe an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Brown, the borough's district attorney, promised a &quot;full, fair and complete investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York officials' greatest fear is a repeat of the Amadou Diallo affair in 1999, from which the city's race relations took years to recover. Diallo was a Guinean immigrant who was killed in a hail of 41 police bullets after he reached for his wal let at the entrance to his block of flats. The four white officers involved in that incident were all acquitted of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Saturday's shooting, the police who opened fire were a mixed group, two white, two black and one Hispanic, and the circumstances were less clear cut. According to the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, a fight broke out outside the Club Kalua in the Jamaica district of Queens, and one of the stag party group shouted &quot;Yo, get my gun&quot;. According to an undercover officer on the scene, Mr Bell then said, &quot;Let's fuck him up&quot;, referring to a man involved in the scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club was under surveillance by a unit looking for evidence of prostitution, illegal guns and drug dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the undercover officers alerted other policemen staking out the club, saying: &quot;It's getting hot on Liverpool (a local street) for real. I think there's a gun.&quot; The officer followed Mr Bell and his friends as they got into their Nissan Altima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the undercover officer approached the front of the car, the car moved forward, striking the undercover (officer),&quot; Commissioner Kelly said. &quot;It then ploughed into the front of the police minivan that had just turned south of Liverpool street. The driver of the Altima put the car in reverse and drove backward on to the sidewalk, slamming into a roll-down gate of the building there, close to where the undercover officer was located. The driver put the car into forward and rammed the police minivan a second time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is when the shooting started. One of the officers who jumped out of the minivan, a 12-year veteran, fired 31 shots, emptying two magazines of his 9mm pistol. Another let off 11 bullets. All the police on the scene were armed with 9mm automatic pistols and none had been involved in any previous shooting incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the silver Nissan stood where it came to rest against the police minivan and the road around it was sown with little flags marking bullet casings and other evidence. The reception hall where Mr Bell had been due to marry his high school sweetheart was still festooned with satin and balloons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Porter, Mr Bell's cousin who was due to be the DJ at the wedding, said 250 people had flown in from around the country for the event. &quot;I can't really express myself. It's a numb feeling,&quot; Mr Porter said. &quot;I still don't want to believe it, a beautiful day like this, and he was going to have a beautiful wedding, he was going to live forever with his wife and children. And this happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rodney King March 1991 Twenty six year-old black man brutally beaten by officers after resisting arrest for speeding; a bystander, George Holliday, videotaped attack. Acquittal of the LAPD officers led to riots in May 1992. King given $3.8m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amadou Diallo February 1999 Street trader from Guinea, shot 19 times when white NYPD officers mistook his wallet for a gun and fired 41 bullets. Four officers acquitted; family paid $3m compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">GRAPHIC: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photo: Osman Orsal, the Associated Press , TURKEY Some 25,000 protesters denounced Pope Benedict as an enemy of Islam at a rally yesterday that underlined deep divisions straining Turkey ahead of the pontiff's visit this week. Officials hoping to promote closer ties with the West urged calm, but Islamic groups wary of western ways united in anger over Benedict's remarks two months ago linking Islam to violence. The protest, organized by an Islamist political party, was the largest mass gathering so far against Benedict's four-day visit scheduled to begin tomorrow, his first papal journey to a mostly Muslim country. Turkish officials hope to use the visit to promote their ambitions of becoming the first Muslim country in the European Union and to showcase Turkey's secular political system. But Islamic groups, which have been gaining strength, see Benedict as a symbol of western intolerance and injustices against Muslims.; Photo: Fabrizio Giovannozzi, the Associated Press , ITALY Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was admitted to the intensive care unit of a Milan hospital for tests yesterday after collapsing while giving a speech. Apparently vigorous and looking younger than his 70 years, he collapsed while delivering a speech to a youth rally in Tuscany. Aides rushed to carry him from the stage. An ambulance arrived, but he walked to leave in his own car. His spokesman, Paolo Bonaiuti, said at the time that he had merely suffered from a drop in blood pressure. Berlusconi, who overcame prostate cancer in the 1990s, told reporters yesterday's problem was a mixture of fatigue, heat and antibiotics he had taken after a recent operation on his knees.; Photo: Jeff Mcintosh, the Canadian Press , ALBERTA Canada's home of bedrock conservatism is a heartbeat away from a seismic shift that could see Alberta's governing Progressive Conservatives move to the far right and perhaps fracture a party that has dominated the province for 35 years. Ted Morton, a rookie backbencher but with deep roots in the Reform party, finished a close second on the weekend to front-runner Jim Dinning, above, denying the former provincial treasurer a first-ballot victory in the race to replace Ralph Klein as party leader and premier. Morton and Dinning, along with veteran cabinet minister Ed Stelmach, square off in a second and final vote this coming Saturday, in which party members will rank the three in order of preference. Morton, 57, worked behind the scenes on the national stage as policy director when the Reform party morphed into the Canadian Alliance before he himself jumped into provincial politics in 2004.; Photo: Ben Curtis, the Associated Press , LEBANON Lebanese troops are on high alert after a top Hezbollah official said the militant Shiite Muslim group will press ahead with threatened street protests seeking to topple Lebanon's western-backed government. The comments by Sheik Naim Kassem came a day after the Lebanese cabinet approved a plan for an international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, overriding objections from Hezbollah and other factions allied with Syria, which many Lebanese blame for the killing. The country is divided between opponents and supporters of Syria, which dominated Lebanon for nearly 30 years until mass street protests and international pressure forced Damascus to withdraw occupying troops last year.; Photo: Peter Morrison, the Associated Press , NORTHERN IRELAND Michael Stone, centre, the Protestant extremist tackled Friday by guards at the Northern Ireland Assembly, has been charged with attempting to murder four people, including Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Stone, 51, has been an icon of extremism since March 16, 1988, when he single-handedly attacked more than 20,000 mourners at an IRA funeral, killing three people and wounding about 60. Later sentenced to more than 700 years in prison, he was paroled in mid-2000 as part of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord. Legal officials now hope to send him back to prison to resume his previous sentence, likely delaying any resolution of the new charges. Stone opposes efforts to have Protestants share power with Sinn Fein.; Photo: Lynne Sladky, the Associated Press , FLORIDA Marlie Casseus, centre, is eager to return to school in her Haitian homeland after a series of operations in Miami have given her hope of a more normal life. The surgeons rebuilt much of the 14-year-old's face and jaw after removing a basketball-sized tumour that has been growing for 10 years. Doctors said her condition is a rare form of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, a nonhereditary genetic disease, which affects every bone in her body, though not to the severity with which it disfigured her face. Doctors say she may need more cosmetic surgery when she stops growing. But she will soon be able to speak again and her liquid diet will slowly be replaced by pur&eacute;ed, soft foods. In her room at Ronald McDonald House near the Miami hospital, Marlie has a book bag packed for the day she returns home. On the Net: Int'l Kids Fund: http:,,www.internationalkidsfund.org,; Photo: Fred Chartrand, the Canadian Press , MALI An African village that has endured a near-biblical string of hardships threw a party yesterday to thank Canada for helping to build a future of hope. The guest of honour in Benieli, Mali, was Governor General Micha&euml;lle Jean, currently on a tour of five African nations, who joined in the dancing. The improvements all began seven years ago when a local woman learned that Canadian help was available to establish a contraceptive program that would prevent the spread of AIDS and help control population growth. Then came a microfinance program that has grown tenfold, cereal banks that stabilized grain prices, and a health centre built with $50,000 from Canada but run with local funds. &quot;We can only thank Canada,&quot; said a village spokesman.; Photo: CANADA Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois Leader Gilles Duceppe sought the support of prominent sovereigntists before grudgingly agreeing to vote in favour of a Conservative motion on Quebec nationhood, says Montreal's La Presse. The newspaper says Duceppe consulted several political allies, including former premiers Jacques Parizeau, Bernard Landry and Lucien Bouchard. He also spoke with his counterpart at the Parti Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, Andr&eacute; Boisclair, before stunning the country with news that the separatist party would vote in favour of the Conservative motion. Sources said Duceppe also consulted constitutional experts who convinced him that the motion, which recognizes a Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois nation &quot;within a united Canada,&quot; will have no negative effect on provincial hopes of becoming a sovereign nation.; Photo: Salvatore Laporta, the Associated Press , ENGLAND British police will question Italian security consultant Mario Scaramella, above, who admits eating at a restaurant with former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko before he fell ill with radiation poisoning.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was to have been the day Nicole Paultre married her high-school sweetheart. The reception hall had been decorated with flowers and balloons; a portable altar and the three-tiered wedding cake were standing by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having been dating for eight years - and having had two children together - Ms Paultre and her fianc&eacute;, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were finally tieing the knot. Their first dance was to be &quot;Here and Now&quot; by Luther Vandross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, on Saturday morning Ms Paultre, 22, was at the Jamaica Hospital in the Queens borough of New York, being told by doctors that her fianc&eacute; had died after being caught in a hail of police gunfire. Officers fired more than 50 bullets at the car that Mr Bell was driving after he and his friends - all young black men - left his stag night party at a strip club. Two of his friends were seriously injured. The details and circumstances of the shooting outside the Kalua cabaret club in the early hours of Saturday are still being investigated but, amid the claims of police brutality and racism, the tragedy of what had transpired is all too clear for the family of Mr Bell and for his bride-to-be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was his wedding day - not his death day,&quot; Mr Bell's aunt, Oniaja Shepherd, said. &quot;We were supposed to go to a wedding. Now we're going to a funeral.&quot; The New York Police Commissioner, Raymond Kelly, said the incident resulted from an undercover operation taking place inside the strip club, which had been linked to drugs and prostitution. He said seven officers in plain clothes were involved in the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said that Mr Bell, 23, and his friends - all unarmed - had left the club at about 4.15am, got into their silver Nissan Altima and driven off. With Mr Bell driving, the car turned a corner and then struck an unmarked police minivan, inside which were several plainclothes officers. Mr Bell then reversed, hit the protective metal screen covering a storefront, and struck an undercover officer, before moving forward and slamming into the police van again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that point, five officers started firing at Mr Bell's car. Mr Kelly said one veteran officer had fired his weapon 31 times, emptying two full magazines. Mr Bell was struck in his neck, shoulder and right arm, while two friends were also hit. Joseph Guzman, 31, who was sitting in the front seat was shot at least 11 times, while 23-year-old Trent Bene-field, who was in the back seat, was hit three times. Mr Guzman was said to be in a critical condition in hospital, while Mr Bene-field was described as stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York police have previously been involved in controversial shootings of black men and the incident has sparked memories of the videotaped beating of Rodney King in 1991, and the beating of William Cardenas, 24, by two Los Angeles policemen in August which was recorded and posted on the YouTube website earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the weekend, New York's Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said it was still too early to draw conclusions: &quot;We know the NYPD officers on the scene had reason to believe an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspaper reports suggested that Mr Bell and his friends had been involved in an altercation outside the club. One of the undercover officers allegedly heard Mr Bell shout: &quot;Let's fuck him up.&quot; Mr Guzman reportedly replied: &quot;Go get my gun.&quot; But Mr Bell's mother retorted: &quot;The police are covering up, because they know the police did wrong. You know how society works. They label all African-American men the same. They should have pulled out a badge before they started shooting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family has been supported by the civil rights campaigner the Rev Al Sharpton, who said: &quot;How does one justify 50 shots at unarmed men?&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US: The New York authorities were scrambling to contain an angry backlash yesterday after police shot a group of three unarmed black men, killing one of them on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting took place after a stag party at a strip club in Queens, a few hours before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (23) was due to marry the mother of his two small daughters. He was struck in the neck and arm and was dead on arrival at hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of his friends, Joseph Guzman, was in a critical condition after being hit 11 times, and another, Trent Benefield, was in a stable condition with wounds to his leg and buttocks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outrage at the shooting was compounded when it emerged that Mr Guzman and Mr Benefield had been shackled to their beds. New Yorkers have also been startled at the apparent wildness of the fusillade. The police claim to have overheard one of three men mention a gun, but no weapon was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers on the scene fired a total of 50 bullets, but fewer than half hit the intended target, a car carrying the three men, despite being fired at close range. The rest sprayed nearby cars and buildings, as local residents leapt out of bed and huddled on the floor. One of the stray bullets shattered a window at a train station in the neighbourhood, injuring two transport police officers with flying glass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting quickly became political with the appearance of community leaders - including the Rev Al Sharpton, the black civil rights leader who has led previous protests against police brutality - alongside the victims' relatives outside the hospital where the wounded men were being treated. &quot;I will stand with this family,&quot; Mr Sharpton said. &quot;This stinks.&quot; New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, urged patience, saying it was too early to draw conclusions. &quot;We know that the officers on the scene had reason to believe an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,&quot; he said. Richard Brown, the borough's district attorney, promised a &quot;full, fair and complete investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York officials' greatest fear is a repeat of the Amadou Diallo affair in 1999, from which the city's race relations took years to recover. Diallo was a Guinean immigrant who was killed in a hail of 41 police bullets after he reached for his wallet at the entrance to his block of flats. The four white officers involved in that incident were all acquitted of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Saturday's shooting, the police who opened fire were a mixed group, two white, two black and one Hispanic, and the circumstances were less clearcut. According to the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, a fight broke out outside the Club Kalua in the Jamaica district of Queens, and one of the stag party group shouted &quot;Yo, get my gun&quot;. According to an undercover officer on the scene, Mr Bell then said, &quot;Let's f*** him up&quot;, referring to a man involved in the scuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club was under surveillance by a unit looking for evidence of prostitution, illegal guns and drug dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the undercover officers alerted other policemen staking out the club, saying: &quot;It's getting hot on Liverpool [ a local street] for real. I think there's a gun.&quot; The officer followed Mr Bell and his friends as they got into their Nissan Altima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the undercover officer approached the front of the car, the car moved forward, striking the undercover [ officer],&quot; Mr Kelly said. &quot;It then ploughed into the front of the police minivan that had just turned south of Liverpool street. The driver of the Altima put the car in reverse and drove backward on to the sidewalk, slamming into a roll-down gate of the building there, close to where the undercover officer was located. The driver put the car into forward and rammed the police minivan a second time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is when the shooting started. One of the officers who jumped out of the minivan, a 12-year veteran, fired 31 shots, emptying two magazines of his 9mm pistol. Another let off 11 bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Porter, Mr Bell's cousin, said 250 people had flown in from around the country for the event. &quot;I can't really express myself. It's a numb feeling,&quot; Mr Porter said. &quot;I still don't want to believe it, a beautiful day like this, and he was going to have a beautiful wedding, he was going to live forever with his wife and children. And this happened.&quot; - (Guardian service)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRIDEGROOM was shot dead on his stag night when police fired more than 50 bullets into his car ... after they were wrongly told he had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, who was due to marry today, had just left a strip club with two friends when five officers opened fire. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One officer fired 31 shots. Sean, a father of two, was hit in the neck and arm. Both friends were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police pounced after an undercover officer said he heard the three men claim they had a gun. But no firearm was found on them or in their bullet-ridden car. A detective at the scene allegedly told a reporter the shooting was &quot;a major screw-up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean's 22-year-old fianc[#x17d]e Nicole, mother of his two daughters, rushed to the bar and told officers: &quot;I am the intended bride&quot; - before fainting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His weeping mum Valerie said yesterday: &quot;I'm numb.&quot; Aunt Oniaja Shepherd added: &quot;We were supposed to go to a wedding. Now we're going to a funeral.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean had been in the New York club with about 20 friends. Photographer Roy Brown said: &quot;No one seemed drunk. They were just regular guys.&quot; Two undercover officers were also in the club on a drugs and prostitution investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five more plain-clothes police were in an unmarked van outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At about 4am there was a scuffle allegedly involving Sean and his two close friends Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One undercover cop says he heard Sean say &quot;Let's f*** him up&quot; and Guzman reply &quot;Yo - go get my gun.&quot; His colleague followed the trio as they left the club and got into their car. The victims' friends say the officer then pulled his gun but failed to identify himself as a cop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say Sean panicked and tried to drive off, clipping the officer and smashing into the unmarked van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover officer opened fire - then four colleagues leapt from the van and also started shooting. An inquiry was last night under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton said: &quot;There's no way we can see how 50 shots had to be fired.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sean's friend Trent, 23, has 17 wounds. Joseph, 31, was hit in the foot and neck. Both are stable in hospital. Police say a fourth man may have fled the car as shooting began.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It haunted him. Bishop Lester Williams had known </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for 12 years, and yesterday, he could not forget the sense of urgency Mr. Bell felt recently to finally marry his high school sweetheart, Nicole Paultre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Almost two weeks ago, at the couple's last meeting with Bishop Williams before their wedding, he said he asked Mr. Bell one last time if he was sure that marriage was for him, and the answer came easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He said, 'Yes, definitely,' '' Bishop Williams recalled. ''He was so sure, he wanted to sign the marriage license right then. He was in a hurry to get this thing done.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday afternoon, Bishop Williams, pastor of the Community Church of Christ in Jamaica, Queens, stood outside the sanctuary, where instead of marrying the couple on Saturday, he led a service to mourn Mr. Bell's death. He died early Saturday after being shot by the police following his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I should have just married them in my office, then had the ceremony later,'' Bishop Williams said. ''I wanted to make sure he was doing this for the right reasons. Now, I feel terrible.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I can't get his face out of my mind,'' he added, remembering how Mr. Bell, who was 23, stopped in the doorway as he left their final meeting. '' 'I'll be back,' he said.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As details of the shooting came to light Saturday afternoon, Bishop Williams said Ms. Paultre, 22, called him and asked if he could somehow still legally marry them. ''We can't do it,'' the bishop said he told her. ''I'm sorry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell's funeral will be at the church at 10 a.m. on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a rally yesterday in front of Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica, where two of Mr. Bell's friends were recovering from wounds suffered in the shooting, community and religious leaders remembered him as a star pitcher for John Adams High School in Ozone Park and a devoted father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Summing up the season of his senior year, The Daily News reported in June 2001 that Mr. Bell had ''dominated'' as a pitcher, finishing his final season with an 11-0 record, a 2.30 E.R.A. and 97 strikeouts in 62.2 innings. Newsday said in July 2001 that he had led John Adams to ''a sixth straight division title.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But his dreams of pursuing a baseball career were put off when he learned that his girlfriend, Ms. Paultre, was pregnant, according to one of his cousins, Kinglarry Crawford. Three years ago, she gave birth to their daughter Jada. Five months ago, their second daughter, Jordyn, was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was a great baseball player. He would have signed professionally,'' Bishop Williams said. ''He gave up all that baseball and everything to be with his high school sweetheart.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell worked odd jobs while the couple lived with Ms. Paultre's parents in an apartment on Beach 27th Street in Far Rockaway, Mr. Crawford said. Still, Mr. Bell kept in shape, running and lifting weights, Mr. Crawford added, hoping to return to the sport one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As time passed, new dreams, beyond baseball, emerged. Mr. Bell hoped to move next year from New York and settle with his bride, possibly, in Atlanta, Mr. Crawford said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He didn't want any more of ''New York life,'' Mr. Crawford said. ''New York is violent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, Mr. Bell seemed to want to leave behind the community, where for him, crime was difficult to avoid. According to a city Department of Correction official, Mr. Bell had been arrested four times, once in 2003, once in 2004, and twice this year, most recently on Nov. 7. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The charges were not available yesterday, but after all four arrests he was released on his own recognizance, suggesting that the arrests involved relatively minor offenses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the couple began the next phase of their lives, Ms. Paultre's parents were planning to help them buy a house if they went through with the move, Mr. Crawford added. Activists, politicians and other speakers at a rally yesterday pledged that they, too, would help support Ms. Paultre and the couple's daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was doing the right thing,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke at the rally. ''He was going to marry the mother of his children.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover police officer who fired the first shots at a carload of men in Queens early Saturday, setting off a storm of police bullets that killed a bridegroom and injured two of his friends, suspected at least one of the men had a gun and was intent on returning with it to a nearby strip club, according to a person briefed on the officers' version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In all, five plainclothes officers -- two of them detectives working under cover -- fired 50 bullets at a silver Nissan Altima, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, who was to be married Saturday, and injuring Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23. Moments earlier, just after 4 a.m., the three had left a bachelor party at Club Kalua, a strip club under surveillance on 94th Avenue in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover detective who fired first had been monitoring the group in the club. Once outside, the detective heard Mr. Guzman say ''Yo, get my gun, get my gun,'' and head with the others to his car, according to police. The undercover officer followed the group on foot, then positioned himself in front of their car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the person briefed on the accounts, the detective, his police badge around his neck, then pulled out his gun, identified himself as a police officer and ordered the occupants to show their hands. They did not comply, the person said, but instead gunned the car forward, hitting the undercover officer and, seconds later, an unmarked police minivan. The undercover officer fired the first of 11 shots, yelling, ''He's got a gun! He's got a gun!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The undercover officer's version of Saturday's shooting came on a day when he and the four other officers involved in the shooting were put on paid administrative leave and stripped of their weapons. The police publicly offered few additional details about the shooting, refusing to even release the names of the officers involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, hundreds of people in Queens angrily protested the shooting, prayed and mourned in vigils, and demanded that the officers resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But one law enforcement official who had information about Mr. Benefield's account said the young man told investigators that Mr. Bell panicked when he saw the undercover officer with a gun because he did not realize the man was a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, for his part, on Saturday night called Mr. Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, 22, who is also the mother of the couple's two young daughters, to express sympathy, city officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No weapons were found in the Altima, which Mr. Bell had been driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In numerous previous police shootings, officers who fired their weapons were reassigned to administrative duties and allowed to keep their guns. Often after those shootings, police spokesmen quickly stated that the shootings appeared to be within department guidelines, and thus justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Saturday's shootings may have violated department rules, which largely prohibit officers from firing at vehicles. According to police guidelines, officers can fire only when they or another person is threatened by deadly physical force, but not if that physical force comes from a moving vehicle alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The theory is that if the cops have time to set up a clean shot, they have time to get out of the way,'' said Eugene O'Donnell, professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ''The cops shouldn't be firing unless they have a clean line of fire. If they have the time to establish that shot they probably have time to get out of the way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said it was too early to characterize the shootings. Mr. Browne said it was the department's prerogative to put the officers on leave until the department learned more about how the night's events unfolded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police investigators will not be able to interview the five men who fired their weapons -- four detectives, two of them working undercover in the nightclub, and one police officer in plain clothes -- until the Queen's district attorney's office finishes its investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said yesterday that there would be &quot;a full and fair investigation,&quot; but that his inquiry was in the preliminary stages. He said it would include a review of autopsy and medical reports, the police reports of the shootings, 911 tapes and video recordings from inside and outside the club. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said it was too soon to say whether the case would be presented to a grand jury. Mr. Brown said that later today, he planned to meet with the Rev. Al Sharpton, other community leaders and some of the victims' family members. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in past police shooting cases, when the facts were in dispute, evidence was put before a grand jury. He said the inquiry likely would go on for a number of weeks, but could not say precisely how long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Roughly 300 protesters gathered at a fiery rally led by Mr. Sharpton in front of Mary Immaculate Hospital yesterday, where Mr. Benefield and Mr. Guzman were recovering from their bullet wounds. Some protesters called for the ouster of Mr. Kelly; others demanded that the five officers resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Malcolm Smith, a Democratic state senator from Queens, urged calm, saying an impartial investigation was under way, but was drowned out by a chorus of shouts and boos. When Thomas White Jr., a councilman who represents the 28th District in Jamaica, said ''We are not going to be angry,'' the crowd roared back: ''Oh, yes we are!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many at the protest saw parallels between Saturday's shooting and the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed Western African immigrant who was fatally gunned down by police officers in 1999. One sign read, ''41 now 50,'' a reference to the number of shots fired at Mr. Diallo and the number fired Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Mr. Diallo's shooting death, though, the four officers who fired at him were white. The undercover officer who fired the first shots Saturday was a Hispanic black, according to the police. Two other officers who fired at the Altima were black, and another two were white, one of whom went through one clip and reloaded his pistol, firing a total of 31 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell's fiancee, Ms. Paultre, collapsed while walking from Community Church of Christ, where supporters were gathered, to the rally, her face twisted with grief. After the rally, protesters marched around the hospital, filling the street and sidewalks and chanting. They marched to the 103rd police precinct station, where officers stood at metal barricades, but the tension broke, and the crowd returned to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After night fell, people gathered in front of Mr. Benefield's apartment building on 123-65 147th Street in Queens, holding candles, laying flowers and murmuring prayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Those shootouts are like the Wild Wild West out there,'' said Bishop Lester Williams, the pastor at the Community Church of Christ, who was going to officiate at the wedding. ''That's an execution -- that's like putting someone in front of a firing squad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Benefield, who had been struck three times in the leg and buttock, was alert and in stable condition, and Mr. Guzman, who had at least 11 bullet wounds along his right side, was in stable but critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. Mr. Guzman, according to the state Department of Correctional Services, has a criminal record including convictions for robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal sale of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sanford Rubenstein, the lawyer representing the two men and their families, said he had not yet spoken with either man and did not know their accounts of the night's events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police, in describing the events leading to the shooting, said that undercover officers and detectives from the Manhattan South vice enforcement squad and the department's narcotics division were patrolling Club Kalua Saturday following a string of violations there for prostitution, under-age drinking and weapons complaints. Eight of the violations this year had resulted in arrests, three of them involving patrons who were arrested for criminal possession of a weapon, the police said. One more violation at the club would result in its closing, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The undercover officer who eventually fired the first shots Saturday had been in the club, the police said. He saw one patron pat his waistband, indicating he had a gun; the undercover officer then radioed his supervisor, who was in an unmarked police car outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The undercover officer then went outside, and saw a group of eight men, including two men believed to be Mr. Guzman and Mr. Bell, arguing with another man. Mr. Guzman then asked for his gun, according to the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group then apparently split up into two groups of four, though it was unclear whether that patron who had patted his waistband was with them, the police said. Mr. Guzman and Mr. Bell's group turned the corner onto Liverpool Street and got into the Altima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  James M. Moschella, a lawyer for the detectives' union who is representing the four detectives during the preliminary stages of the investigation, defended their actions yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Each officer who discharged their weapons believed that their lives and the lives of their partners were in imminent danger,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael J. Palladino, the president of the Detective Endowment Association, insisted that deadly force was being used against the detectives, which could have justified their response. ''The amounts of shots that were fired do not necessarily spell out the word excessive,'' he said.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is known in police parlance as ''contagious shooting'' -- gunfire that spreads among officers who believe that they, or their colleagues, are facing a threat. It spreads like germs, like laughter, or fear. An officer fires, so his colleagues do, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The phenomenon appears to have happened last year, when eight officers fired 43 shots at an armed man in Queens, killing him. In July, three officers fired 26 shots at a pit bull that had bitten a chunk out of an officer's leg in a Bronx apartment building. And there have been other episodes: in 1995, in the Bronx, officers fired 125 bullets during a bodega robbery, with one officer firing 45 rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just what happened on Saturday is still being investigated. Police experts, however, suggested in interviews yesterday that contagious shooting played a role in a fatal police shooting in Queens Saturday morning. According to the police account, five officers fired 50 shots at a bridegroom who, leaving his bachelor party at a strip club, twice drove his car into a minivan carrying plainclothes police officers investigating the club. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bridegroom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was to be married hours later, was killed, and two of his friends were wounded, one critically. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the layman, and to the loved ones of those who were shot, 50 shots seems a startlingly high number, especially since the men were found to be unarmed. And police experts concede that the number was high. Yet they also note that in those chaotic and frightening fractions of a second between quiet and gunfire, nothing is clear-cut, and blood is pumping furiously. Even 50 shots can be squeezed off in a matter of seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We can teach as much as we can,'' said John C. Cerar, a retired commander of the Police Department's firearms training section. ''The fog of the moment happens. Different things happen that people don't understand. Most people really believe what it's like in television, that a police officer can take a gun and shoot someone out of the saddle.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The five officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative duty yesterday -- without their guns -- as the Police Department and the Queens district attorney investigated the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and relatives of Mr. Bell, joined by the Rev. Al Sharpton, staged a rally and a march to demand answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officers have not yet been interviewed by police investigators or prosecutors to give their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Again and again, the focus of the day returned to the number of bullets that went flying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the officers fired more than half the rounds, pausing to reload, and then emptying it again, 31 shots in all, according to the police. Another officer fired 11 shots. The others fired four shots, three shots and one shot apiece, the police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it is the total number of shots that shook and angered the families of the men and community leaders. ''How many shots?'' Mr. Sharpton asked yesterday, over and over, in a chant at a rally in a park near Mary Immaculate Hospital, where the wounded men were being treated. The crowd called back, ''Fifty!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Statistically, the shooting is an aberration. The number of shots fired per officer who acted in the 112 shooting incidents this year, through Nov. 19, is 3.2, said Paul J. Browne, a department spokesman. Last year, that number was 3.7 shots fired per officer in 109 incidents. They are down from 4.6 in 2000 and 5.0 in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But shootings with high numbers of shots fired, however rare, call to mind dark events of the city's past, like the 1999 killing of Gidone Busch, who was clutching a hammer when officers fired 12 times, and, most notably, the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who died in a hail of 41 bullets, also in 1999. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the 1995 Bronx bodega robbery in which officers fired 125 shots, the suspects did not fire back. ''They were shooting to the echo of their own gunfire,'' a former police official said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shooting on Saturday unfolded in a flash. An undercover officer posted inside the Club Kalua, a site of frequent drug, weapon and prostitution complaints in Jamaica, overheard an exchange between a stripper and a man that led the officer to suspect the man was armed, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said on Saturday. The undercover officer alerted the officers acting as backup outside -- there were seven officers in all -- about 4 a.m., setting into motion the events to follow later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eight men left the club and argued briefly with another man, with one from the group saying, ''Yo, get my gun,'' Mr. Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The eight men apparently split into two groups of four, with one group piling into a Nissan Altima driven by Mr. Bell, Commissioner Kelly said. As an undercover detective who had been following the group on foot approached the vehicle, Mr. Bell drove into him, striking his leg, before plowing into a minivan carrying two backup officers, the commissioner said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Altima reversed, mounting a sidewalk and hitting the lowered gate of a building before going forward and striking the van again. The officers opened fire, striking Mr. Bell, 23, twice, in the right arm and neck, Commissioner Kelly said. The critically wounded man, Joseph Guzman, 31, was struck 11 times, and the third man, Trent Benefield, 23, three times. Mr. Kelly said it was unclear whether there was a fourth man in the car and what became of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A person familiar with the case who knows the detectives' version of events said yesterday that it was Mr. Guzman who asked for his gun, and that the first undercover detective on foot clearly identified himself to the occupants of the car and, gun drawn, told them to get out. Instead, the person said, they roared toward him. That detective fired the first shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the ensuing barrage, one shot struck the window of a house, another a window at an AirTrain platform, injuring two Port Authority police officers with flying glass. It appeared that the Altima was struck by 21 shots, fewer than half of the number fired, the police said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The whole thing most likely took less than a minute. The officer who fired 31 times could have done so in fewer than 20 seconds, with the act of reloading taking less than one second, Mr. Cerar said. The 49 shots that followed the undercover detective's first may have been contagious shooting, said one former police official who insisted on anonymity because the investigation is continuing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He shoots, and you shoot, and the assumption is he has a good reason for shooting. You saw it in Diallo. You see it in a lot of shootings,'' the official said. ''You just chime in. I don't mean the term loosely. But you see your partner, and your reflexes take over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The phenomenon of officers' firing dozens of shots at a time dates back in part to 1993 and the department's switch from six-shot .38-caliber revolvers, cumbersome to reload, to semiautomatic pistols that hold 15 rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber. The change, like any of its magnitude, followed years of studies and differences of opinion, and finally came into effect after the 1986 murder of a police officer, Scott Gadell, who was reloading his six-shooter when he was fatally shot. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commissioner Kelly, during his first term in the office, in 1992 and 1993, ordered a switch to semiautomatics, but ordered the clips modified to hold only 10 rounds. That modification was later undone, prompting him, after Mr. Diallo's shooting six years later, to speculate in a New York Times op-ed article, ''Now may be the time to re-impose it and to intensify training that teaches police officers to hold their fire until they know why they are shooting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College, said a high number of shots fired underscores the threat the officers felt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The only reason to be shooting in New York City is that you or someone else is going to be killed and it's going to be imminent,'' he said. ''It's highly unlikely you fire a shot or two shots. You fire as many shots as you have to, to extinguish the threat. You don't fire one round and say: 'Did I hit him? Is he hit?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cerar said, ''Until we have some substitute for a firearm, there will always be a situation where more rounds are fired than in other situations.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The men split into two groups and disperse. An undercover detective follows one, including the person alleged to have made the remark about his gun, as they make their way east on 94th Avenue and turn south on Liverpool Street. Backup teams, a Toyota Camry with a lieutenant and two officers and a minvan with two officers, follow. The men enter a Nissan Altima parked on Liverpool Street.<BR><BR>4.The undercover detective approaches the front of the Altima, and the car moves forward, striking him. The Altima then continues forward and crashes into the minivan. The Altima drives backward onto the sidewalk, striking the gate in front of a building, then forward, striking the minivan again. According to the police, the undercover detective fires first, a total of 11 times.The two officers in the minivan get out and fire 34 shots between them. Two officers in the Camry fire a total of five times.</SPAN></P>

Officers fired 107 rounds at the robbers -- not 125, the number initially provided by the police; and the robbers did in fact return fire. (The number of shots fired by the police was revised during the investigation, which also revealed that the robbers had fired back, according to law enforcement officials.) A reader pointed out the errors in an e-mail message in November; this correction was delayed while the Police Department and the Bronx district attorney's office checked their records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City police officers fire dozens of rounds of bullets, and an unarmed 23-year-old black man is killed. In its simplest terms, the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by police officers in Queens on Saturday morning has inevitably led to comparisons to the case of Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant who died in a hail of police gunfire in February 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, as the Queens district attorney and the Police Department investigated Mr. Bell's death and as community leaders, elected officials, and clergy members staked out their positions yesterday, there is much about the principals -- and indeed the city -- that has changed in seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's mayor has an established, politically useful record of reaching out to black leaders at times of crisis, and his police commissioner has shown a willingness to publicly question shootings by members of his force. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this case, as well, the racial makeup of the five officers involved in the shooting -- two white, two black and one Hispanic -- reflects a more diverse police force than when Mr. Diallo was shot by four white officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, much about the shooting -- what prompted it, and whether it was justified -- remains to be settled, and nothing will change the fact that a young man, hours from his wedding, lost his life, leaving two children without a father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the first hours of the tragedy appeared to follow a distinctly different script from the Diallo case, as city officials worked to maintain calm. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans to meet Queens community leaders today at City Hall to discuss the shooting; he talked to prominent black elected officials and religious leaders throughout the weekend, and has spoken with Mr. Bell's fiancee on the phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, Mr. Bloomberg's police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, has generally received favorable reviews from minority leaders over the course of his two terms at the top of the department. Indeed, hours after a police officer shot and killed a 19-year-old man on the roof of a Brooklyn public housing project in January 2004, Mr. Kelly called the shooting unjustified, a move that many saw as a break from the days when the city seemed to reflexively defend the use of deadly force by its officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even the one person who is playing a role similar to the one he played in 1999 -- the Rev. Al Sharpton -- finds himself at a different moment in his career, and in a far different relationship with City Hall. Mr. Sharpton, who has said much about the shooting ''stinks,'' and who has called for a thorough investigation, has nonetheless been in direct contact with the mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Diallo case in 1999 shook the administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was then the mayor, and led to waves of protests. Mr. Giuliani had waged a successful, but unrelenting and unapologetic war against crime during his first five years in office. All along, he seemed to go out of his way to dismiss people who saw a racial aspect to the department's work, and its use of force. When the Diallo shooting happened, Mr. Giuliani certainly had no reservoir of good will among the city's minority population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It clearly, for example, would have been out of character for Mr. Giuliani and Howard Safir, the police commissioner when Mr. Diallo was shot, to reach out to Mr. Sharpton. In fact, it took Mr. Giuliani a month after the shooting to meet with black elected officials to discuss the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bloomberg, by comparison, immediately enlisted his administration's highest-ranking black official, Dennis M. Walcott, the deputy mayor for education and economic development as his point person on the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Walcott, who lives near the scene of the shooting, went to the scene of the shooting in Jamaica, Queens, Saturday morning, has spoken with Mr. Sharpton repeatedly, and attended a rally and prayer vigil yesterday for Mr. Bell and two other men who were injured in the shooting. At the vigil, Mr. Walcott also spoke with Mr. Bell's mother and relatives of the other men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Relations between minority communities and the police in the Bloomberg-Kelly years have improved considerably from before,'' said Jerome H. Skolnick, a New York University law professor who has studied the use of excessive force by the police. ''The low point of police-community relations may well have been the Diallo shooting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To be sure, the changed dynamic and cast of characters do not mean the new shooting will less inflammatory and painful than past fatal police shootings have been. And there were some signs yesterday of growing dissatisfaction with Mr. Kelly, who was police commissioner from 1992 to 1994 and again since 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Michael Bloomberg was and is a breath of fresh air since Giuliani,'' said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, the pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and one of the city's most prominent black clerics. But he added: ''People really believe that the mayor does not have control of his commissioner and that the commissioner is insensitive. He's got the politically correct language, but not the proper back-office training. All that glitters is not gold. Kelly is getting another look.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among black elected officials from Queens, however, there has so far been praise for Mr. Bloomberg. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Senator Malcolm A. Smith, a Democrat from Queens, said he spoke with Mr. Bloomberg by phone about the shooting at least four times on Saturday. ''He was very disturbed by the incident and very concerned about the family,'' Mr. Smith said. ''He indicated that he would make sure there would be a clear, impartial investigation that would bring out all the facts, and wherever the chips may fall, they fall.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Smith said he was at the home of Nicole Paultre, whom Mr. Bell was to marry, when Mr. Bloomberg called him on his cellphone. At the mayor's request, Mr. Smith said, he put Ms. Paultre on the phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Smith said that he believed the mayor was committed to a full investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  David N. Dinkins, who was mayor from 1990 to 1993, said he received a message from Mr. Bloomberg yesterday about the Bell case. ''The difference in the behavior and attitudes of this police commissioner, this mayor, contrasted with Giuliani, is night and day,'' said Mr. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States Representative Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat from Queens, whom the mayor called on Saturday, echoed that comparison. ''This mayor is more open, more inclusive, more honest and less secretive -- as opposed to the former mayor, who basically shut everyone out and refused to meet most of the time and was very combative,'' Mr. Meeks said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, would not say yesterday where the mayor was over the weekend, but said that the mayor was in touch by phone and e-mail messages constantly with his top assistants. The Daily News reported that Mr. Bloomberg had an appointment Saturday at the Mid Ocean Club, an exclusive golf resort in Bermuda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andrew Hacker, a political scientist at Queens College, cautioned that Mr. Bloomberg will have to walk a fine line between showing sensitivity and giving the police -- for now -- the benefit of the doubt. ''It's always necessary for any mayor to back up his police department; he's done this with Kelly just as strenuously as Giuliani did with Safir,'' Mr.Hacker said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Mr. Sharpton, who led angry street protests in the wake of the Diallo shooting, took the city to task yesterday, signaling that he will not shirk from confrontation in this case. He compared the death of Mr. Bell to Mr. Diallo and to Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant who was brutalized in a police station house in Brooklyn in August 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It'll be the first major case of its kind of the 21st century in New York,'' Mr. Sharpton said of the Bell case. ''People are very energized about it. I think the city should be working to suspend those cops and show they're seriously going after some justice here.''<BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, had hardly been dead for a day before the usual crowd began calling for the resignation of the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly. While the facts of the police shooting in which Bell was killed are still under investigation, enough is known to make some essential points. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is that the officers who shot Bell were risking their own lives to protect the community in which he lived. They were out in the dark and cold early on a holiday weekend morning, monitoring what Mr. Kelly later called an establishment with a &quot;chronic history of narcotics, prostitution and weapons complaints.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second is that Mr. Kelly himself has far more personal credibility than many of the protesters. This is true both on matters of crime and on the matter of race, which the protesters have a way of injecting even where it isn't relevant. On crime, the reductions attained under Mr. Kelly's leadership have been historic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is plenty of credit to go around - Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg and Governor Pataki and Senator Bruno and the local district attorneys and United States attorneys and FBI agents and some of the tougher judges, not to mention the officers and brass of the NYPD share it - plenty of the credit belongs to Mr. Kelly. His first term as police commissioner was as the appointee of Mayor Dinkins, and he has made a concerted effort to improve relations with minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the protesters, City Council Member Charles Barron has favored freeing the convicted murderer of two police officers, and he hosted the exceptionally brutal dictator of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, at City Hall. As for the Rev. Al Sharpton, after Tawana Brawley, Crown Heights, and Freddy's, he has been left without credibility. Rev. Sharpton, doubtless hoping to re-live the mass arrests of the Giuliani-Diallo days, needs Bell's grieving friends and relatives far more than they need him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically motivated prosecutions of police officers involved in unintended mistakes tend to backfire. Witness the acquittal on all counts in 2000 of the four officers charged with killing Amadou Diallo. The death of any unarmed innocent man at the hands of police is a tragedy that bears serious investigation. But calls for Mr. Kelly's resignation only discredit the protesters.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg will return to the public stage this morning and begin dealing firsthand with a fatal police shooting that has produced tensions that the Reverend Al Sharpton and City Council Member Charles Barron are vowing will culminate on December 6 in a large protest against police brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloomberg and the police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, will meet with community members this morning at City Hall to discuss the shooting. Though Mr. Bloomberg was out of town when the incident happened, he has reached out to local politicians and spoken to the woman who was to be wed on Saturday to the man killed in the shooting, a spokesman said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, one day after the fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Queens, the Rev. Sharpton, a longtime critic of the New York Police Department, called the shooting part of a systemic abuse of power by the department. He spoke with other politicians and black leaders in a park in front of Mary Immaculate Hospital in the Jamaica section of Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Council members Charles Barron and James Sanders, Jr., called for Mr. Kelly to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other city politicians took a more cautionary stance about the shooting, saying they would wait for the results of the investigation before making a judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tragedy,&quot; a council member and chairman of the Public Safety Committee, Peter Vallone, Jr., said. &quot;But our police are forced to make split-second, life-or-death decisions almost every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton predicted, &quot;This is going to be a watershed case.&quot; He said that after the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx, the NYPD disbanded the street crime unit. He said he wanted a similar system-wide change in response to Bell's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to happen,&quot; Rev. Sharpton said. &quot;This man should be on his honeymoon with his wife this morning. ... We're not going to stop until we get an answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Sharpton led the crowd in several count-offs to 50, the number of bullets fired by police at the car driven by Bell, 23, who was killed, and his two friends, Joseph Guzman, 21, and Trent Benefield, 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Guzman was in critical condition at Mary Immaculate Hospital with 11 bullet wounds yesterday, and Mr. Benefield was listed as stable with three bullet wounds. Bell was pronounced dead at the hospital after the incident. He was shot four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three men were leaving Bell's bachelor party at Kalua Cabaret on 95th Avenue at about 4 a.m. on Saturday when the shooting occurred, according to a police account. An undercover detective, who was investigating possible illegal activities at the club, followed the men after they got into a dispute with another man outside the bar. Based on earlier comments that the detective heard, including one of the men allegedly saying, &quot;Yo, go get my gun,&quot; the detective believed at least one of the men was armed, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, the men then got into a Nissan Altima and drove into the undercover officer, hitting him in the shin, before crashing into a minivan with two police officers inside, police said. The car then reversed onto the sidewalk and into a garage gate, before going forward and crashing into the minivan again, police said. The two officers in the minivan fired 34 shots, including one 12-year-veteran who fired his gun 31 times, stopping to re-load once. Two officers and a lieutenant in a Toyota Camry fired a total of five times. The undercover officer fired 11 times, police said. No weapon was found at the scene, but police said they were investigating whether a fourth person fled during the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five police officers involved with the shooting have had their guns confiscated and put on paid administrative leave until further notice, a spokesman for the police, Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Paul Browne, said. The Queens District Attorney, Richard Brown, is conducting an investigation into the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers are not allowed to shoot at or from a moving vehicle &quot;unless deadly force is being used against the police officers or another person present by means other than a moving vehicle,&quot; according to the NYPD patrol guide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was going to marry his high school girlfriend, Nicole Paultre, 22, on Saturday at 5 p.m. He has two daughters with Ms. Paultre, Jada, 3, and Jordyn, who is five months old. He worked most recently as a milk deliveryman, but had aspirations of becoming a professional baseball player, friends said. After the marriage he planned on taking his family to Atlanta, where his father-in-law had promised to buy them a house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is devastated,&quot;a cousin of Bell's, Kinglarry Crawford, 35, said. &quot;Some can't even talk right now. They're speechless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the speakers invoked the 1999 case of Diallo, who was shot 41 times by police, as a comparison to Bell's shooting. Diallo, who was unarmed, was shot and killed by four officers who allegedly mistook him for a serial rapist as he reached for his wallet. A Bronx grand jury indicted the four officers in the Diallo case on 2nd degree murder, but a jury acquitted the officers of all counts in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The godfather of Mr. Guzman, Greg Jones, said the incident had shaken his faith in the police department. His father was an officer in the 79th precinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am disgusted at being the son of a member of the New York Police Department with them shooting us down like this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop of the church where Bell was to be married, Lester Williams, led the crowd in a prayer vigil before the families of the victims marched around the hospital arm in arm. One group of protesters then broke off and marched up Jamaica Avenue to the 103rd precinct, where they rallied before a wall of police officers and listened to more speeches. The protesters blocked traffic, but police facilitated the march and no arrests were made yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families of the three men went to the Community Church of Christ for a 3 p.m. memorial service, where Ms. Paultre officially joined the congregation, Mr. Crawford said. Bell's funeral is expected for Friday. Rev. Sharpton and Mr. Barron said they would hold a large anti-police brutality rally outside One Police Plaza on December 6. In the aftermath of the Diallo shooting, which took place during the Giuliani administration and under a different police commissioner, such rallies were regular occurrences, with Rev. Sharpton and many politicians and activists getting themselves arrested in acts of civil disobedience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A doomed young groom was caught in the crossfire of an undercover cop, whose bullets went clear through his car, and confused officers who returned their own blistering barrage, sources told The Post last night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blaze of gunfire lasted just 10 seconds outside the seedy Kalua Cabaret strip club in South Jamaica early Saturday. But it ended the life of 23-year-old, unarmed Queens dad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was set to marry his high-school sweetheart and the mother of his two young daughters hours after his bachelor party at the club.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dramatic new details of the deadly mayhem include the undercover cop at one point climbing onto the hood of Bell's car -  his gun drawn and his police shield around his neck -  screaming, &quot;Police! Turn off your car! Let me see your hands!&quot; said sources who talked to some of the cops involved in the shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bell then tried to run down the plainclothes officer -  twice -  the cop began shooting, with some of his 11 bullets piercing the rear window of the man's Nissan Altima, the sources said.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This left the cop's backup unit -  which was just arriving on the scene amid shattering glass and the undercover's shouts of &quot;He's got a gun!&quot; -  thinking they were being fired upon from inside the vehicle. That's when they returned fire with another 39 bullets. One 12-year veteran, a narcotics detective, pumped 31 bullets, authorities said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources recounted step-by-step how quickly things spiraled out of control after a dispute inside the club involving one of Bell's associates.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the sources, two undercovers were at the strip joint as part of the NYPD's new Club Enforcement Initiative. The program was started after the July slaying of 18-year-old Jennifer Moore of New Jersey, who partied at a Chelsea club before being abducted, raped and killed in a Weehawken hotel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercovers, who usually worked in Manhattan, were on the last night of their two-month Queens job to try to nail the Kalua and other clubs on such violations as drugs and underage prostitution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the club, one of the plainclothes cops sat next to a woman he thought was a hooker and might proposition him, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, a burly man approached them and told the woman that he had heard she had gotten into a fight with a group of guys earlier in the club. It was unclear what it was over.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man said, &quot; 'Don't worry, baby, I got you covered,' and he takes her hand, and he rubs it across [the gun in] his waistband,&quot; a source said. &quot;Then he tells her, 'That's what I'm here for.' &quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear how the man smuggled his weapon past the metal detector outside the club. He likely was a regular who knew the bouncer at the door and may have worked there part time, helping with security, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover then went outside the club and radioed his backup to tell them there was a man inside with a gun. It was around 3:30 a.m.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the undercover was outside, the suspect came out along with the girl and others, since it was around closing time.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover watched as an argument erupted between Bell's group, which included three male pals and the beefy man with the gun, and four other men -  with the woman in the middle of them, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman was overheard saying to the men arguing with Bell's pals, &quot;I'm not doing you all. I'll do one or two, but not all,&quot; according to the sources.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the same time, the undercover said he heard Bell's friend Joseph Guzman tell his buddies, &quot;Yo, get my gun! Get my gun! Let's get my gun from the car! Yeah, we're gonna f- - - him up!&quot; the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undercover, thinking there was about to be a drive-by shooting in front of the club involving Bell's group, followed Guzman, Bell and two others to their car.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's getting hot! Something's going to happen! Something's going down!&quot; the undercover radioed to his backup.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hurried to the front of Bell's Altima, which was parked on the side of nearby Liverpool Street, and jumped in front of it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's when the undercover put his right leg up on the hood of the Altima and began screaming that he was a cop, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cop was leaning over the hood of the car to try to see the hands of the people inside and make sure they didn't have any guns, they said. But Bell floored the gas pedal and headed for the cop, the sources said, striking him and badly cutting his knee.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Altima's passengers -  who possibly had a gun -  jumped out of the back of the car, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the same time, an unmarked Toyota Camry driven by a plainclothes police lieutenant and another cop behind him pulled up, but overshot Bell's car. A police van with an officer and the narcotics detective then managed to block Bell's car in.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's Altima first struck the police van in the driver's desperate bid to escape, then backed up and struck the roll-down metal doors of a commercial building behind him. He then revved his car again toward the undercover -  which prompted the cop to scream, &quot;He's got a gun!&quot; and start firing, according to the sources, with the bullets passing through Bell's car.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The undercover thought they had more than one gun. He thought they would do anything to get away. He was yelling, 'Let me see your hands!' &quot; one source said.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other cops, thinking they were under attack, started firing at the car, too.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point, the detective thought his gun had jammed and so reloaded his magazine and emptied the clip again at the car, firing 31 bullets.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was killed, Guzman critically injured, and a third friend, Trent Benefield, was shot. They are expected to live.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield later told a friend from his hospital bed that he and his buddies didn't know the undercovers were cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told investigators, &quot;I got into the car, and there was all this shooting.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear when the other four men who were originally fighting with Bell and his pals fled the scene. They were spotted leaving in a black SUV.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell had been arrested three times in the past: twice for drugs and one on a gun rap in a case that was sealed. Guzman has been busted nine times, including for armed robbery. He spent two stretches in state prison in the '90s. Benefield has a sealed record as a juvenile for gun possession and robbery.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some marijuana was later found near the Altima, and investigators believe that it may have been tossed out by the group before the gunfire. Two bullet casings also were recovered from the Altima, although cops said they do not believe they were from a police gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting of Bell, who was black, has ignited racial tensions in the city -  even though the cops involved included two blacks, a Hispanic and two whites.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five cops who fired shots were put on administrative duty. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said it was the first time that any of the officers were involved in a shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said the cops were justified in firing off a total of 50 bullets at unarmed men because Bell was using his car as a lethal weapon.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE furious crowd was cau  tioned not to forget the les  sons learned from the case of Amadou Diallo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The idea is to show we're with the family, not that the family is with us,&quot; the Rev. Al Sharpton told the several hundred people gathered at the Community Church of Christ in Jamaica, Queens, yesterday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is their burden. We are here to help them and to support them, and if you're so mad that you can't do it, then step back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton was urging supporters to remain level-headed in their protests against the cops who fatally gunned down an unarmed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, a dad of two, on his wedding day Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said the community must avoid any behavior that could taint a potential jury pool if a case against the officers involved is ever brought to trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reminded them of Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who was killed in The Bronx in February 1999, when cops fired 41 shots at him after he reached for a wallet they mistook for a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The venue in that case was changed to Albany, where the police officers involved were eventually acquitted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's mourners remembered that case as they clasped the silver-bell party favors from a wedding that never was. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still in shock, Bell's bride-to-be, Nicole Paultre, asked pastor Lester Williams, who was supposed to marry the couple, if he could perform the ceremony anyway so that she could fulfill her promise to Bell and their two small daughters. Williams could not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So yesterday, after all the prayers were prayed and all the songs were sung, Nicole followed through on another promise: She joined the church. But not before telling Jada, 3, that Daddy was gone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Sean was alive, he had to console Jada about the death of a puppy, Williams said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He always told Jada, 'When you see the sun, you'll see the puppy,' &quot; Williams said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had to tell her that Daddy was taking care of the puppy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church where Williams saves souls every Sunday is a long way from Marengo County, Ala., where the bishop grew up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in Alabama, in searing heat and soaring tension, that Williams saw firsthand the racial struggle that would change his life and the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His adolescence was marked by pivotal moments of the civil-rights movement: the violent Selma-to-Montgomery march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the church bombing in Birmingham that killed four little girls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He never dreamed he'd be fighting the same fight 40 years later in New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was Williams at the pulpit yesterday, consoling a heartbroken family of another unarmed black man gunned down by police in a shooting that has all the hallmarks of unjustifiable homicide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were some things we endured as children that I thought would have passed and gone,&quot; Williams said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have thought in 2006, we would have moved beyond this type of racism.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Saturday's shooting, Williams recalled, &quot;I said to myself, 'I took it when I was growing up. I'm not taking it anymore.' &quot; </SPAN></P>

The attacker drove his car up to the convoy and then blew himself up, said Kandahar provincial police chief Ismatullah Alizai. Another civilian was wounded, and some 15 camels who were with a group of nomads were killed, he said. On Sunday, a Pakistani suicide bomber detonated himself in a crowded restaurant, killing 15 people and wounding 24, including an Afghan special forces commander and a district chief, who appeared to be the target of his attack, the provincial governor said. Also Sunday, one NATO soldier and an estimated 57 insurgents were killed in four other attacks in southern Afghanistan.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Man killed in dispute over $20 bet</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEXINGTON, S.C. -- A man fatally shot his friend with a high-powered rifle in a dispute over a $20 bet on the annual South Carolina-Clemson college football game, authorities said Sunday. James Walter Quick, 42, has been charged with murder in the shooting of Richard Allen Johnson, 43, authorities said. The two, who drank beer all afternoon and watched the game Saturday at Johnson's home, began arguing about the bet after the game. Lexington County Sheriff James Metts said Quick got his hunting rifle from his car and fired one shot, hitting Johnson in the chest. Deputies arrested Quick without incident. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Brit slams Putin, calls ties strained</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- A British Cabinet minister accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of &quot;attacks on individual liberty and on democracy&quot; and said Sunday that relations with Moscow were strained after a former KGB agent was poisoned to death in London. The comments by Peter Hain, the government's Northern Ireland secretary, were the strongest leveled at Moscow since Alexander Litvinenko died Thursday. &quot;His success in binding what is a disintegrating nation together with an economy that was collapsing into Mafioso style chaos ... must be balanced against the fact there have been huge attacks on individual liberty and on democracy,&quot; Hain said of Putin. British officials have so far avoided blaming Moscow for Litvinenko's death and Hain did not comment directly on the case.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Answers sought in police shooting</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- An angry crowd demanded Sunday to know why police officers killed an unarmed man on the day of his wedding, firing 50 shots that also wounded two of the man's friends. At a vigil and rally the day after 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed, a crowd led by the Rev. Al Sharpton shouted &quot;No justice, no peace.&quot; &quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; Sharpton said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the wounded men was in critical condition. The police officers' group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care said it was issuing a vote of no confidence in Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly over the shooting. The five officers involved in the shooting were placed on paid administrative leave pending investigation.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Oaxaca protestors torch buildings</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAXACA, Mexico -- Leftist protesters trying to force out the Oaxaca state governor set fire to another building Sunday after a night of torching government offices and vehicles in running street battles with police that injured at least 43 people. The violence broke out late Saturday after masked youths broke away from a protest march by about 4,000 people and began attacking police and buildings. Police drove off attackers hurling rocks, fireworks and gasoline bombs in the main square with tear gas and jets of water from tanker trucks and also drove protesters from a camp at a smaller plaza two blocks away. In a press statement, the federal police said 152 people had been arrested. State prosecutors said at least 43 people were injured.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rebels in Chad press on to capital</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels who overran the largest city in eastern Chad on Saturday disappeared almost as quickly as they had arrived, as government soldiers re-established control Sunday. But even as government forces retook Abeche, a rebel column headed toward the capital, N'Djamena, the French Embassy said. It was impossible to say if the group had come from Abeche or was another group of rebels. The government of Chad accuses neighboring Sudan of supporting rebels' attempts to overthrow the president, and on Sunday Chad's communications minister accused Saudi Arabia of supporting them also.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hezbollah plans surprise protests</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Hezbollah's deputy secretary-general said Sunday the militant Shiite Muslim group will press ahead with threatened street protests and other peaceful means seeking to topple Lebanon's Western-backed government and will stage its actions without warning. Sheik Naim Kassem's comments came a day after the Cabinet approved a plan for an international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, overriding objections from Hezbollah and other factions allied with Syria, which many Lebanese blame for the killing.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Somalia militia nears Ethiopia</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOGADISHU, Somalia -- The Islamic militia that controls much of southern Somalia dispatched thousands of troops Sunday to within nine miles of the border with Ethiopia. &quot;All our troops in the region are now ready at the front lines to face their enemy,&quot; said Mohamed Mohamud Agaweine, the military commander for the Council of Islamic Courts in central Somalia. A local reporter also said the Islamists were recruiting people for a holy war against Ethiopia, a largely Christian nation that supports Somalia's fragile government. On Saturday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said he expected legislators to back a resolution giving him authority to use military force against Somali extremists if they attack Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>

Afghan officials say the majority of suicide bombers in the southeastern province of Paktika come from neighboring Pakistan. Also Sunday, one NATO soldier and an estimated 57 insurgents were killed in four other attacks in southern Afghanistan. President Bush and Afghan President Hamid Karzai in a call Saturday evening discussed proposed plans for an upcoming meeting involving tribal leaders from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Karzai hopes the meeting can help solve the problem of militants from Pakistan launching attacks in Afghanistan.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Man killed in dispute over $20 bet</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEXINGTON, S.C. -- A man fatally shot his friend with a high-powered rifle in a dispute over a $20 bet on the annual South Carolina-Clemson college football game, authorities said Sunday. James Walter Quick, 42, has been charged with murder in the shooting of Richard Allen Johnson, 43, authorities said. The two, who drank beer all afternoon and watched the game Saturday at Johnson's home, began arguing about the bet after the game.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- A British Cabinet minister accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of &quot;attacks on individual liberty and on democracy&quot; and said Sunday that relations with Moscow were strained after a former KGB agent was poisoned to death in London. The comments by Peter Hain, the government's Northern Ireland Secretary, were the strongest leveled at Moscow since Alexander Litvinenko died Thursday. &quot;His success in binding what is a disintegrating nation together with an economy that was collapsing into Mafioso style chaos ... must be balanced against the fact there have been huge attacks on individual liberty and on democracy,&quot; Hain said of Putin. British officials have so far avoided blaming Moscow for Litvinenko's death and Hain did not comment directly on the case.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Answers sought in police shooting</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAXACA, Mexico -- Leftist protesters trying to force out the Oaxaca state governor set fire to another building Sunday after a night of torching government offices and vehicles in running street battles with police that injured at least 43 people. The violence broke out late Saturday after masked youths broke away from a protest march by about 4,000 people and began attacking police and buildings. Police drove off attackers hurling rocks, fireworks and gasoline bombs in the main square with tear gas and jets of water from tanker trucks, then advanced in massed ranks to drive protesters from a camp at a smaller plaza two blocks away. In a press statement, the federal police said 152 people had been arrested. State prosecutors said at least 43 people were injured.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Chad's army tries to divert rebels</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAMIDJA, Chad -- As a rebel convoy headed toward N'Djamena, the capital of this volatile central African nation, government troops set up roadblocks and began searching cars and fighting-age men. In a radio broadcast Sunday, Chad's communications minister, Moussa Doumgor, repeated accusations that neighboring Sudan is financing the rebels, which Sudan denies. For the first time, h accused Saudi Arabia of supporting the rebels as well.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several hundred people gathered yesterday for a vigil and rally to demand answers about why officers fired a flurry of bullets at 23-year-<BR>old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> early Saturday, hours before he was supposed to marry the mother of his two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers were placed on paid administrative leave, said a spokesman for the NYPD. Police and prosecutors promised a full investigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of that stemmed the fury of a community outraged by the shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot allow this to continue to happen,&quot; the Rev. Al Sharpton said at the gathering outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, where one of the two wounded men was in critical condition. &quot;We've got to understand that all of us were in that car.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has said that police shot at the car after it drove forward and struck an undercover officer and an unmarked police minivan. The information was based on interviews with witnesses and two officers who did not fire their weapons, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a witness account emerged today disputing that version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trini Wright, a dancer at the strip club where Bell's bachelor party was held, told the Daily News she was going to a diner with the men when the police minivan appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minivan ... smashed into their car. And they (the police) jumped out shooting,&quot; Wright, 28, said. &quot;No 'stop.' No 'freeze.' No nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly had said Saturday the police department was still piecing together what happened and that it was too early to say whether the shooting was justified. He said it was unclear whether the officers, who were in plain clothes, identified themselves before firing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Browne said, &quot;We are continuing to look for additional witnesses to shed light on the incident and assisting the district attorney's office with its investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Kelly planned to meet with community leaders at City Hall. Bloomberg and his aides were in contact with Bell's family and community leaders throughout the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre, made a quiet visit to the site of his shootings before dawn today, lighting candles clustered around a photograph of the smiling couple with one of their daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shootings occurred after 4 a.m. Saturday outside the Kalua Cabaret in Queens. Kelly said the incident stemmed from an undercover operation by seven officers investigating the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was struck twice. The survivors were Joseph Guzman, 31, who was shot at least 11 times, and Trent Benefield, 23, who was hit three times. Guzman was in critical condition Sunday and Benefield was stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers' shots struck the men's car 21 times. They also hit nearby homes and shattered windows at a train station, though no residents were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police thought one of the men in the car might have had a gun, but investigators found no weapons. It was unclear what prompted police to open fire, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kelly, the groom was involved in a verbal dispute outside the club, and one of his friends referred to a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover officer walked closely behind Bell and his friends as they headed for their car. As he walked toward the front of the vehicle, the car drove forward, striking the officer and minivan, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer was apparently the first to open fire, Kelly said. He had served on the force for five years. One 12-year veteran fired his weapon 31 times, emptying two full magazines, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total, it is believed 50 bullets were fired, he said. It was the first time any of the officers, all of whom carried 9 mm handguns, had been involved in a shooting, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point, Bell backed the car onto a sidewalk, hitting a building gate, police said. He then drove forward, striking the police vehicle a second time, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police department's policy on shooting at moving vehicles states: &quot;Police officers shall not discharge their firearms at or from a moving vehicle unless deadly force is being used against the police officers or another person present, by means other than a moving vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers' group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care said it was issuing a vote of no confidence in Kelly over the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community leaders planned a rally Dec. 6 at police headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't the first time the NYPD has come under scrutiny over officer-involved shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1999, police killed Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from Guinea in western African who was shot 19 times. The four officers in that case were acquitted of criminal charges. And in 2003, Ousmane Zongo, a native of Burkina Faso in western African, was hit four times, twice in the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSH MOTORCADE <BR>Police officer dies<BR>HONOLULU -- President Bush sent his condolences to the family of an officer who died less than a week after three police motorcycles crashed while escorting the presidential motorcade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Favela, 30, and two other officers crashed as the motorcade traveled across Hickam Air Force Base to meet troops for breakfast early Tuesday. Light rain had been falling, and some roads on the base were slick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Favela, who suffered internal injuries and had been in critical condition at The Queen's Medical Center, died yesterday. The other officers were treated at the medical center and released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush said in a statement that he and the first lady were &quot;deeply saddened&quot; by the death, and sent their condolences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Officer Favela risked his life every day to protect the people of his community,&quot; Bush said. &quot;In this time of great sadness, we give thanks for his life of service.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers across the state will place black bands across their badges in honor of Favela, an eight-year veteran of the Honolulu Police Department and father of four, Police Capt. Frank Fujii said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I received the phone call that Steve had passed away, quite frankly my heart just sank to the guts of my stomach,&quot; Fujii said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the White House medical team -- including an ambulance -- were cut loose from the motorcade to help with the crash. Local ambulance and fire units also responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bush had spent the night on the base on his way back from a trip to Indonesia and Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate incident, a fourth solo motorcycle officer crashed and injured his wrist when attempting a U-turn on loose gravel while escorting the president last Monday night. He was treated and released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also during the president's 16-hour stopover, a White House staff member was hospitalized early Tuesday after being mugged by three assailants near Waikiki Beach.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Police fired 50 rounds Saturday at a car of unarmed men leaving a bachelor party at a strip club, killing the groom on his wedding day in a shooting that drew a furious outcry from family members and community leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spray of bullets hit the car 21 times, after the vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and then an unmarked NYPD minivan twice, police said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly would not say if the collisions were what prompted police to open fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was too early to say whether the shooting was justified, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police thought one of the men in the car might have had a gun. But armed with a search warrant, police found no weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it is too early to draw conclusions about this mornings shootings ... we know that the NYPD officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,&quot; Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the incident stemmed from an undercover operation inside the strip club. Seven officers in plain clothes were investigating the Kalua Cabaret, and five were involved in the shooting. The gunfire also hit nearby homes and a train station, though no residents were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A veteran officer fired his weapon 31 times, emptying two full magazines, Kelly said. All the officers carried 9mm handguns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, who was driving, was identified as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23. Joseph Guzman, 31, was in the front seat and was shot at least 11 times. Trent Benefield, 23, who was in the back seat, was hit three times. Guzman was listed in critical condition and Benefield was in stable condition. Police shoot 3 people near strip club in NYC; man killed on day of his wedding</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours before he was to be married, a man leaving his bachelor party at a strip club in Queens that was under police surveillance was shot and killed early yesterday in a hail of police bullets, witnesses and the police said. Two of his friends were wounded, one critically, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many details of the shooting were not immediately clear, but relatives of the dead man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, and community leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, demanded an investigation into what some called an overreaction by officers that killed a man on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses told of chaos, screams and a barrage of gunfire near Club Kalua at 143-08 94th Avenue in Jamaica about 4:15 a.m. after Mr. Bell and his friends walked out and got into their car. Mr. Bell drove the car half a block, turned a corner and struck a black unmarked police minivan bearing several plainclothes officers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell's car then backed up onto a sidewalk, hit a storefront's rolled-down protective gate and nearly struck an undercover officer before shooting forward and slamming into the police van again, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In response, five police officers fired at least 50 rounds at the men's car, a silver Nissan Altima; the bullets ripped into other cars and slammed through an apartment window near the shooting scene on Liverpool Street near 94th Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell -- who was to have been wed at 5 p.m. yesterday to Nicole Paultre, 22, the mother of his two small daughters -- was shot in the neck, shoulder and right arm and was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two wounded men, Joseph Guzman, 21, and Trent Benefield, 23, were taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital, where Mr. Guzman was listed in critical condition and Mr. Benefield in stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said at a news conference last night that the men's car had been hit at least 21 times. He said he did not know what triggered the shooting and that it was too early to tell if it was justified. No guns were found at the scene, and no charges have been filed against the men, the police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement last night that it was too early to draw conclusions about the case. ''We know that the N.Y.P.D. officers on the scene had reason to believe an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and were trying to stop it,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Angry relatives of Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield charged that both had been arrested and manacled to their hospital beds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police acknowledged that the men had been handcuffed, but said it had been a precaution at a time when it was unclear whether they were armed. Through the day, the police gave few details about what had happened, calling it a matter under investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly acknowledged last night that much about the episode was unclear, partly because police investigators are precluded for now from questioning the officers involved; a lieutenant and another officer who did not fire any shots were questioned, though. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, Commissioner Kelly said that about 4 a.m. a group of men confronted a man outside the strip club and that one man in the group yelled, ''Yo, get my gun.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The altercation broke up, and the men separated into two groups, with an undercover officer following one group. The men being followed by the undercover officer got into the Altima that then hit the minivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police said that one officer who leaped from the minivan, a 12-year police veteran, fired 31 times, and an undercover officer with nine years on the force fired 11 times. The other officers fired three, four and five times. Shell casings from the officers' 16-shot, 9-millimeter semiautomatic weapons littered the street; at least 40 were later recovered. A fourth person may have been in the Altima, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legal experts said that investigators, at the behest of prosecutors, almost never interrogate officers involved in fatal shootings, even if criminal conduct is suspected, because doing so might grant a form of immunity and jeopardize prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, declined last night to comment on the substance of the case, but promised a ''full, fair and complete investigation.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shootings reverberated with echoes of the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed street vendor and Guinean immigrant who was killed in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment by four police officers who were later acquitted of criminal charges in his death. That killing raised questions of racial profiling and excessive force by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One police official denied any racial motivation in yesterday's shooting and said that two of the officers involved were white, one Hispanic and two black. The victims were either black or Hispanic. None of the officers had been involved in previous shootings, Mr. Kelly said. He said several officers were injured, but none seriously. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton, a civil rights leader who has often protested police actions in high-profile and racially charged cases, challenged the police to explain what had happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a shocking case,'' he said at an afternoon news conference outside Mary Immaculate Hospital, his second of the day in the case. He was flanked by relatives and friends of the victims, most of them somber and some sobbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton said Mr. Guzman might have been struck by anywhere from 8 to 17 bullets. ''The doctor told us it was 17 wounds,'' which could have included entry and exit points, he noted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At an earlier news conference at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Mr. Sharpton, standing with Ms. Paultre and other relatives and friends of the shooting victims, said he had been called in by Mr. Bell's family and had protested to the city ''that this stinks.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Paultre and Mr. Bell, who lived at 91 Beach 27th Street in Far Rockaway, Queens, had been sweethearts since high school. Relatives said Mr. Bell had been a baseball star at John Adams High School in Ozone Park, and noted that Ms. Paultre had attended a bridal shower on Long Island on Friday. The relatives identified their daughters as Jordyn, 3, and Jada, 5 months old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A woman who said she was Mr. Benefield's mother but did not give her name, said her son had been treated like a criminal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's got a shattered leg,'' she said. ''And he's handcuffed. Right hand, left leg.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An aunt of Mr. Guzman, who also did not give her name, said her nephew had been shot repeatedly. ''He got shot 17 times by the police,'' she said. ''Unbelievable. My nephew is laying up there fighting for his life, shot 17 times. It's not right.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marie Gillion, an aunt of Ms. Paultre, said in a telephone interview that the families had been overjoyed at the prospect of the wedding. ''Sean is a good kid,'' she said, choking back sobs. '' The family wanted them to be married. And for this to happen. This is so sad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert Porter, who said he was Mr. Bell's cousin and was to have been a disc jockey at the wedding, said that 250 people had been invited to the ceremony and that many were flying in from around the country. ''I can't really express myself,'' Mr. Porter said. ''It's a numb feeling. I still don't want to believe it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The events that led to the shooting began with a bachelor party at Club Kalua, a cabaret in a largely residential neighborhood. A police official said that a female undercover officer had been posted inside, backed up by plainclothes officers in two vehicles outside, to investigate chronic reports of drugs and prostitution. Similar surveillance operations have been mounted at clubs in Chelsea in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was unclear what time Mr. Bell and 20 friends arrived at the club. Eric C. Arrington, 43, said he had been there and noted that the party was not rowdy. The men had platters of rice and chicken. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly after 3 a.m., Commissioner Kelly said, the undercover officer inside overheard a club dancer complain about a patron who appeared to be armed, and she went out to alert her supervisor and the backup team of possible trouble. About 4 a.m., as Mr. Bell and some of his friends left, a fight erupted outside. It was unclear who was involved, but it ended and those involved split into two groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four men were then observed getting into Mr. Bell's Nissan Altima, which drove a half block east on 94th Avenue and turned south into Liverpool Street. There it plowed into the unmarked police minivan on the driver's side, apparently just missing a head-on collision. Witnesses said the car suddenly went into reverse, backing up onto a sidewalk where the undercover officer was positioned, then pulled forward and rammed the minivan a second time. That's when the police opened fire, Mr. Kelly said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One neighbor said his car was hit by three bullets and a fourth smashed through his front window, piercing a lamp in the living room. ''There was bullets all over the place,'' said Paul Gomes, 31, who awoke to the barrage of gunfire and pulled his wife and children onto the floor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert and Vivian Hernandez, residents of Liverpool Street, were watching television when they heard the crashing of bullets and people yelling. When the gunfire finally died down, they went outside and saw a man leaning on a fence and moaning, ''They shot me in the leg.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly said that two Port Authority Police Officers suffered minor facial injuries at a nearby AirTrain facility when one of the bullets shattered a window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Within minutes, a swarm of police cars converged on the scene and a helicopter appeared overhead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The block where the shooting occurred was sealed off by police tape yesterday afternoon. But the cars involved in the collision were still in the middle of the street, with the Altima pressed up against the driver's side of the minivan. Investigators were tagging shell casings where they lay, numbering them. There was one large cluster near the victims' car, and others were littered about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At La Bella Vita, the Ozone Park catering hall where the Bell-Paultre reception was to have taken place, there was still a sign up late in the day, announcing the celebration. About 200 people were to have attended, said the owner, Tony Modica. He said he had taken 50 phone calls from people seeking directions, and had found himself breaking the terrible news, over and over. <BR><BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">CORRECTION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;An article on Sunday about a police shooting in Queens in which a bridegroom driving away from a strip club was killed and two of his friends wounded gave an erroneous age, supplied by the police, for one victim. (The same error appeared in some copies on Monday in a front-page article about ''contagious shooting'' -- gunfire that spreads among officers who believe that they, or their colleagues, are facing a threat.) The victim, Joseph Guzman, who was critically wounded, is 31, not 21. A map with the article on Monday misstated the location of a storefront gate that the bridegroom backed his car into; it is on the east side of Liverpool Street in Jamaica, not at 94-08 Liverpool, which is on the west side. (A corrected version is at nytimes.com/region.) A picture caption in some copies with a related article on Monday misspelled the surname of another victim, who was also wounded. He is Trent Benefield, not Benfield.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the groom is dead at the hands of police, and his mother is devastated.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm numb,&quot; said Valerie Bell, whose son, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was one of three men shot by cops near the Kalua club in Jamaica, Queens. &quot;He was supposed to get married today. I'm numb.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's cousin Robert Porter, who was supposed to be the DJ at the wedding, said Bell was eager to take the next big step in his life.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was going to have a beautiful wedding, live his life with his children, and now this,&quot; Bell said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a good young man, never caused any problems, and now he's dead.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and fianc&eacute;e Nicole Paultre, 22, began dating eight years ago as students at John Adams HS in Ozone Park, where Bell was a star baseball player.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago, the two had their first daughter, Jada, and five months ago, they had their second girl, Jordyn.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was after the second child that they decided to tie the knot &quot;because it's the right thing to do,&quot; said Paultre's godfather, Ray Hargrove, 53.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've been sweethearts since high school, and they stuck together. And now they were going to make it righteous.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple expected 160 people from around the country to attend their wedding reception at the La Bella Vita restaurant and catering hall, just a few blocks from their high school.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that is where they will hold the funeral reception.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He did not deserve to be killed execution-style on his wedding day,&quot; said Paultre's mother, Laura. &quot;He was a beloved son, father, soon to be husband.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salmon, roast beef and pork loin highlighted the buffet menu, but alcohol was not to be served, except for one champagne toast.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not celebrating,&quot; said Paultre's father, Les. &quot;I'm supposed to be celebrating my daughter's wedding.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">La Bella Vita owner Tony Modica said he saw only    good things in the    young couple.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were really    in love, you could    just tell,&quot; he said. &quot;They were a very nice family.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flowers never arrived and the cake was never baked.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families have now shifted their focus toward justice, enlisting the aid of the Rev. Al Sharpton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, she's preparing for his funeral rather than his wedding,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;We need real answers.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Queens bachelor party turned into a bloodbath early yesterday when five cops opened fire on a car with 50 shots - killing the groom-to-be, wounding his two friends and leaving furious relatives demanding answers from the NYPD.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 4 a.m. shooting in Jamaica happened just after the trio had left a strip club called the Kalua Restaurant and Lounge, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, celebrated his last night as a single man, police said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said an undercover officer, part of a seven-cop unit conducting surveillance on the troubled nightspot, followed the men from Kalua after overhearing a fight in which Bell had said, &quot;Let's f- him up.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the undercover cop then heard Bell's pal Joseph Guzman shout, &quot;Yo, go get my gun!&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments later, a second undercover cop confronted the three men as they got into their Nissan Altima on Liverpool Street. The Altima pulled forward and hit the cop, then continued and crashed into an unmarked police minivan that had just turned the corner from 94th Avenue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Altima then backed up, jumped the curb, hit the rolled-down gate of a building, went forward and clipped the minivan a second time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the undercover cop hit by the van, just prior to his run-in with the trio, had yelled, &quot;It's getting hot on Liverpool! For real, I think there's a gun!&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That detective squeezed off the first shot, Kelly said, and four other cops began firing what became dozens of rounds into the Nissan, bullets flying in all directions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said a total of 50 shots were fired - including 31 by one detective.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police source said the undercover cop had identified himself before he was hit by the car.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw two cars facing each other. I saw the [detective] jump out and start shooting,&quot; said Daniel Rafael, 23, who had been on his way home from a party. &quot;I saw them fire about six or seven shots. That's when I ran inside.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, whose wedding to Nicole Paultre, his longtime girlfriend and the mother of his two daughters, had been scheduled for 5 p.m. yesterday, was shot in the neck and arm. He was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman, 31, was shot in the foot and neck, Kelly said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third friend, Trent Benefield, 23, suffered 17 wounds, though it was unclear how many were from bullets.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources said there may have been a fourth man who ran from the Altima before the shooting started.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One detective on the scene shook his head as he told The Post that the shooting was &quot;a major screw-up.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cop later said, &quot;It could be like the guy with the wallet&quot; - referring to unarmed Bronx man Amadou Diallo, who in 1999 was hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired by cops as he grabbed for his wallet.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg said in a statement: &quot;Although it is too early to draw conclusions . . . we know that the NYPD officers on the scene had reason to believe that an altercation involving a firearm was about to happen and [that they] were trying to stop it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources said detectives from a Manhattan South vice squad were at Kalua, a known prostitution and drug den, conducting surveillance as part of a citywide crackdown on club crime.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had been targeting prostitution, but their attention was diverted when two undercover cops inside the club noticed a bouncer signaling to a dancer that he had a gun and telling her that he could take care of any problems for her.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops radioed detectives in the unmarked van about the gun. That's when Bell, Guzman and Benefield were overheard getting into a fight.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said that the shooting was now the subject of a grand-jury investigation and that he could not say whether it was justified.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me assure everyone that this will be a full, fair and complete investigation,&quot; Queens DA Richard Brown said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the cops involved ranged in experience from five to 17 years. The detective who fired 31 times has been on the force 12 years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standard-issue police pistol holds 16 rounds. There were at least 45 evidence markers, normally used to document the location of shell casings, on the ground.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the three victims - none of whom was charged with any crime - each had a rap sheet with multiple arrests and at least one gun-related charge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops were searching last night for evidence in their vehicle, including a secret compartment where a gun could be stored, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A doctor said Guzman and Benefield were in stable condition at Mary Immaculate Hospital - where relatives and the Rev. Al Sharpton demanded an explanation for what they insisted was an unjustified shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no way in anyone's mind that we can see how 50 shots had to be fired,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;For this kind of shooting to happen based on their story is absolutely unthinkable.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was black, as are Guzman and Benefield. Two of the five cops involved in the shooting are white, two are black, and the other is Hispanic.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among unanswered questions are:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Why did Guzman spend half of yesterday handcuffed to his hospital bed?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* And why was Benefield shackled hand and foot to his?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives said the two were initially placed under arrest, but the cuffs were removed after press inquiries.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Club photographer Roy Brown said the three friends were having a quiet, well-behaved evening at Kalua. He said they didn't have any drinks and were just enjoying the entertainment, at one point posing for pictures.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were just in there like the other guys, watching the girls, all having fun,&quot; he said. &quot;None of them seemed drunk to me. They were just regular guys.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men left the club just before the 4 a.m. closing time and had planned to go to a diner with a stripper named Trini, Brown said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were celebrating. The guy was getting married,&quot; said Benefield's mom, Denise Ford. &quot;They left the club. They made a mistake and ran into a [detective's] car.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford said the shooting left her son &quot;angry, very angry.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said the cops were too &quot;hotheaded.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Something needs to be done about them,&quot; she said. &quot;They do things and get away with it. It's not right or fair to us. Something needs to be done, and I'm going to start.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One bullet struck an AirTrain elevated platform above 94th Avenue, shattering a window and spraying glass on two Port Authority cops. None of the six people on the platform was hurt, but service was shut down for seven hours.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of last night, cops had not yet recovered a gun from the Altima.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield's pregnant fianc&eacute;e, Nyla Paige, 18, didn't expect them to find anything.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you ask me, it's an outrage,&quot; she said - &quot;innocent people in a car getting shot for no reason.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents on Liverpool Street said they were startled as bullets went through windows, into cars and even hit a lamp in one man's living room.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard several shots one after the other - pow-pow-pow,&quot; said a college student named Sad&eacute;. &quot;I thought it was a dream, but then I heard, like, sirens and helicopters and ambulances.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cops had a guy in handcuffs on the ground. He was shot in the legs,&quot; she said. &quot;Somebody was wiping his leg. There was a lot of blood around. They picked him up by the shoulders, and he was screaming, 'My legs! My legs!' &quot;     </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Police opened fire early yesterday on a car full of men driving away from a bachelor party at a strip club, killing the groom on his wedding day after an undercover officer was rammed with the car. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said it was too early to say whether the shooting was justified. At least three officers were injured, he said. The incident, which occurred around 4 a.m., stemmed from an undercover operation inside the club, Kelly said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police fired 50 rounds Saturday at a car of unarmed men leaving a bachelor party at a strip club, killing the groom on his wedding day in a shooting that drew a furious outcry from family members and community leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spray of bullets hit the car 21 times after it rammed into an undercover officer and then an unmarked NYPD minivan twice, police said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly would not say if the collisions were what prompted police to open fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was too early to say whether the shooting was justified, Kelly said. Police thought one of the men in the car might have had a gun. But armed with a search warrant, police found no weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the incident stemmed from an undercover operation inside the strip club. Seven officers in plain clothes were investigating the Kalua Cabaret, and five were involved in the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groom, who was driving, was identified as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">MINNESOTA</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officials to scale back search for missing boys</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four days of combing through a vast wooded stretch of land, but finding no sign of two young brothers who went missing on the Red Lake Indian Reservation, authorities said Saturday they are likely to scale back the air and ground search later today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pending decision follows the most intensive and expansive day of searching for Tristan A. White, 4, and Avery Lee Stately, 2. The effort included dive teams from three counties, remote-controlled aerial vehicles peering overhead and about 100 professionals, plus scores of volunteers, withstanding below-freezing temperatures looking for the boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tristan and Avery were last seen Wednesday morning as they played outside their home in the remote Walking Shield area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FBI Special Agent Paul McCabe said Saturday afternoon that authorities are taking a two-pronged approach, trying to determine whether the boys wandered off or whether foul play was involved.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">FLORIDA</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="c8">Woman found dead behind her bookcase</SPAN><BR></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weber, 38, returned home Oct. 28 and greeted her mother, then wasn't seen again. Her family thought she had been kidnapped and contacted authorities. Family members scoured her room for clues but found nothing, though they did notice a strange smell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nov. 9, Weber's sister went into her bedroom and looked behind a bookcase, where she saw the woman's foot. Using a flashlight the family saw Weber was wedged upside-down behind the unit.</SPAN></P>

The Health Protection Agency, however, urged anyone who had been at a sushi bar and a hotel visited by Alexander Litvinenko on Nov. 1 to be tested by the National Health Service. Litvinenko, 43, died Thursday, killed by the radioactive isotope polonium-210. Police have found radioactive traces at the Itsu sushi bar in central London, the Mayfair Hotel bar and at the Kremlin critic's home in north London. Friends accuse President Vladimir Putin of orchestrating the assassination, a charge Putin has denied.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Retail sales strong, except for Wal-Mart</SPAN><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- The nation's retailers had a strong start to the holiday shopping season, according to a national research group. But a big exception was Wal-Mart, which expects November same-store sales to be below its already lackluster forecast. ShopperTrak RCT, which surveys more than 45,000 mall-based retail outlets, Saturday reported sales rose 6 percent to $8.96 billion on Friday, compared with the same day a year ago. &quot;This data shows an even larger increase than expected as consumers proved they were willing to spend,&quot; said Bill Martin, of ShopperTrak. Wal-Mart, however, estimated it will post a 0.1 percent decline in November in same-store sales, or sales at stores opened at least a year. Meanwhile, J.C. Penney reports it's off to &quot;a good start&quot; with strong sales in home entertainment, fashion jewelry, decorations and women's shoes.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police kill groom on wedding day</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- A bachelor party at a strip club ended Saturday with police opening fire on a group of men, killing the groom on his wedding day. Two men were wounded, one critically. Bullets hit the car used by the three men 21 times after the vehicle rammed into an undercover officer and then an unmarked NYPD minivan twice, police said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly would not say if the collisions were what prompted police to open fire. Police searched the car and found no weapons. None of several officers near the Kalua Cabaret in Queens was reported injured.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- A Protestant militant was charged Saturday, a day after being arrested in an attack on Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, leaders of the main Roman Catholic party Sinn Fein, as they and other legislators worked on a power-sharing agreement for Northern Ireland. Michael Stone, who served time for sectarian killings, rushed the entrance to the provincial Assembly with a fake gun and a bag of pipe bombs. He was disarmed in the lobby by security guards. Stone, 51, faces five counts of attempted murder.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pinochet defends coup on birthday</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANTIAGO DE CHILE -- Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, in power from 1973 to 1990, took full responsibility for the first time Saturday for the killings and torture that occurred during his reign. At his 91st birthday party, Pinochet also defended the military coup that ousted the elected president, Marxist Salvador Allende. The general sat by his wife as she read his statement, which said in part, &quot;I take political responsibility for everything that was done which had no other goal than making Chile greater.&quot; Pinochet said the coup was staged to protect the country's integrity. About 200 supporters later sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to him. Pinochet -- who previously blamed the abuses on subordinates -- has been indicted for tax evasion and in two human rights cases.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">10 million deaths marked in Ukraine</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KIEV, Ukraine -- Holding candles, thousands massed on a fog-shrouded square Saturday to mourn 10 million Ukrainians who died in a famine orchestrated by Soviet leader Josef Stalin -- an ordeal they say should be recognized as genocide. The 1932-33 famine wiped out a third of Ukraine's population in a calamity known as Holodomor -- Death by Hunger. Stalin ordered villagers to meet grain quotas that typically exceeded crop yields. Officials then would seize all the grain and stop starving residents from leaving. Russia has warned the leaders of the former Soviet republic against using the term genocide, saying the event should not be &quot;politicized.&quot; However, 10 nations, including the U.S., have agreed the famine should be described as genocide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel and the Palestinians agreed yesterday to a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip to end a five-month Israeli military offensive and the firing of rockets by Palestinian militants into the Jewish state. It was to take effect this morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas phoned Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert last night to tell him he'd arrived at an agreement with all Palestinian factions to stop firing rockets into Israel from the coastal strip, an Olmert spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lebanon's U.S.-backed government has approved the creation of an international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri, overriding objections by Hezbollah and the country's pro-Syrian president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approval was expected to deepen the country's political crisis and spark mass street demonstrations threatened by Hezbollah and its allies to topple the government of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora. An ongoing UN investigation into the February 2005 truck bombing that killed Hariri and 22 others has said the killing's complexity suggests the Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services played a role.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - A column called &quot;Ask a Mexican&quot; began as a one-time feature - written with tongue only partly in-cheek - by staff writer Gustavo Arellano for the OC Weekly in Orange County, Calif. It became a surprise hit and very popular continuing column. Judging by some of my own mail, I'm not surprised. In fact, I have long wanted to write a similar column and call it &quot;Ask a Black Man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is probably as good a time as any. People have questions about other people in our diverse society and it's often hard to find answers without worrying about offending somebody. Recent racial eruptions seem to have left some with so many questions and confusion that they are even willing to turn to a newspaper columnist for answers. For example: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Page:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it when blacks use the word &quot;nigger&quot; there is no outcry? If you're offended by Michael Richards' use of this word, how do you feel when you are sitting in your car waiting for the light to change and the radio in a car next to you is blaring this word, and worse, the driver's kids are in the car? I guess it's only wrong if a nonblack uses the word. Both parties are wrong, but like we would say when we were kids, &quot;Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names can never hurt me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sincerely,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed L., Honolulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Ed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good points. And &quot;aloha,&quot; Honolulu. Be careful, however, about what you say to that guy in the next car or you might get your own bones broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But seriously, the Rev. Jesse Jackson is trying to extend the legs of the controversy stirred up when Michael &quot;Kramer&quot; Richards of Seinfeld fame hurled the N-word at hecklers. Jackson has called on all entertainers and everyone else to stop using the word. Frankly, I don't expect much. The late, great comedian Richard Pryor turned against the word quite convincingly after using it so liberally in the 1970s. Pryor's condemnation of the word hasn't caught on yet, either, although I am always ready to be pleasantly surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Page:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black-on-black crime (especially murder) is such a huge and rampant reality in this country, but God forbid a policeman might make a mistake and hurt or kill a black thug and they're ready to loot and riot at the drop of a hat. The question is: Can you make sense of this African-American hypocrisy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M.D., Chicago</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear M.D.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am often asked why so many black Americans still support the Rev. Jesse Jackson or the Rev. Al Sharpton, even though their tactics seem mostly to be stuck in the 1960s. I find my answer in wire stories like this recent dispatch from New York City: &quot;The morning 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was shot to death by police, his grieving relatives did something that has become almost routine in such cases: They called the Rev. Al Sharpton. Within hours, the longtime civil-rights activist had consoled relatives, held two news conferences, and begun organizing a community rally for the next day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, just ask yourself: If police shot your son to death before his wedding and wounded two friends after firing 50 shots into their car and there was no gun found in their car, whom would you call?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Page:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I found it interesting that ESPN found an obscene gesture by Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick after the game Sunday to be offensive enough to blur it out. Did you notice this was not done with Mr. Richards' actions? So help me understand why you as well as other journalists and broadcasters have not written one sentence to crucify his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for your time,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred T.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Fred:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You're welcome, but I don't do sports. Besides, in the entertainment industry known as professional football, stars don't get stigmatized easily for affronts to mere decency. They have to blow a lot of touchdowns first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Page:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may very well be that Mr. Richards is not a racist, if you consider a racist to be someone who harbors negative perceptions about and feelings toward anyone and everyone from a certain race. A likely scenario is that Mr. Richards realized from the lack of audience response that his act was not going over well, was thus already uptight and flew into a rage when heckled. I could be wrong, but I can't help thinking that if his hecklers had been two overweight white folks, he would have burst into an expletive-laden monologue about Moby Dick, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Best wishes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil from Libertyville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Phil:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, but I don't think being called a big, fat whale carries quite the same sting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NUEVA YORK -- La polic&iacute;a cometi&oacute; un crimen cuando mat&oacute; a un hombre desarmado que sal&iacute;a de su despedida de soltero en un bar, dijo el activista por los derechos civiles Al Sharpton, quien destac&oacute; el mi&eacute;rcoles que uno de los polic&iacute;as implicados en el tiroteo recarg&oacute; su arma al menos en una ocasi&oacute;n. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consideramos que se cometi&oacute; un crimen en contra de Sean. Consideramos que se cometi&oacute; un crimen contra los otros dos&quot;, dijo Sharpton, refiri&eacute;ndose a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> de 23 a&ntilde;os, y otros dos hombres, uno de ellos puertorrique&ntilde;o, que lo acompa&ntilde;aban en una celebraci&oacute;n en un bar con bailarinas nudistas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los tres fueron acribillados mientras estaban a bordo de un autom&oacute;vil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uno de los polic&iacute;as recarg&oacute; su arma. Se le acabaron las balas y la recarg&oacute;. Perm&iacute;tanme destacar algo, eran armas semiautom&aacute;ticas. Ellos ten&iacute;an que jalar el gatillo conscientemente cada vez. No hubo pausa alguna&quot;, dijo Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El jefe de polic&iacute;a Raymond Kelly dijo que un polic&iacute;a, veterano de 12 a&ntilde;os, dispar&oacute; al menos 31 veces su pistola, con capacidad de 16 cartuchos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton y el tambi&eacute;n activista afroamericano Jesse Jackson se presentaron el mi&eacute;rcoles junto con la familia de las v&iacute;ctimas en la cuadra del barrio de Queens donde ocurri&oacute; el tiroteo. Cerca de un altar improvisado con flores y velas, una corona en un tr&iacute;pode estaba adornada con la foto de Bell, su novia y una de sus hijas peque&ntilde;as, con la leyenda: &quot;Amate a ti mismo, det&eacute;n la violencia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El malestar de la comunidad qued&oacute; claro con una serie de letreros pegados con cinta adhesiva a un muro cercano. &quot;Muerte a la Brutalidad Polic&iacute;al y el Asesinato&quot;, dec&iacute;a uno de ellos, escrito a mano. &quot;Maten a los cerdos que le disparan a nuestros muchachos&quot;, dice otro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson dijo en el sitio que &quot;esto es un s&iacute;mbolo, no una aberraci&oacute;n. Nuestro sistema de justicia penal est&aacute; averiado&quot; en relaci&oacute;n &quot;a la Norteam&eacute;rica negra, a los j&oacute;venes negros&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Guzm&aacute;n, de 31 a&ntilde;os e hijo de padre puertorrique&ntilde;o, recibi&oacute; 11 balazos, y estaba herido de gravedad, mientras que Trent Benefield, de 23 a&ntilde;os, fue alcanzado tres veces y se hallaba estable. Todas las v&iacute;ctimas eran negras, mientras que los polic&iacute;as eran dos blancos, dos negros y un hispano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El alcalde de Nueva York, Michael Bloomberg, dijo el martes que era &quot;inaceptable e inexplicable&quot; c&oacute;mo la polic&iacute;a pudo haber hecho 50 disparos, pero agreg&oacute; que una investigaci&oacute;n va a determinar lo que sucedi&oacute;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Me parece que el n&uacute;mero de disparos hechos ... fue excesivo&quot;, declar&oacute; Bloomberg en una conferencia de prensa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seg&uacute;n informes de prensa, uno de los polic&iacute;as dice que escuch&oacute; que uno de los hombres en el veh&iacute;culo hablaba de buscar un arma. Seg&uacute;n informes, los polic&iacute;as estaban encubiertos, y uno de ellos orden&oacute; al autom&oacute;vil detenerse, identific&aacute;ndose como polic&iacute;a. A pesar de ello, seg&uacute;n los reportes, el autom&oacute;vil embisti&oacute; varias veces el veh&iacute;culo policial no marcado.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> died and two mates were seriously wounded because officers believed firearms were about to be used and were trying to stop it happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the victims - who had crashed into an unmarked police van - were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems more likely they'd simply driven drunk and had a prang.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor of New York acknowledged yesterday that excessive force was used when police shot a bridegroom outside his stag party in a fusillade of 50 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As activists planned a big rally against police violence for next week, Michael Bloomberg invited local black leaders to City Hall in an attempt to quell outrage over the killing of the young black man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is to me unacceptable or inexplicable how you can have 50 shots fired,&quot; Mr Bloomberg said, promising a full investigation. &quot;The community is outraged and I am, to put it mildly, deeply disturbed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, 23, was killed in his car outside the topless club in the Jamaica section of New York early on Saturday, hours before his planned wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two passengers were wounded when undercover officers who had been staking out the club unleashed the hail of shots on the car in the apparently mistaken belief that one of the men was armed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black activists, led by the Rev Al Sharpton, staged protests against what they called police brutality and scheduled a demonstration for December 6. But the shooting did not provoke a repeat of the racial tension that followed the 1999 death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant shot by police in a burst of 41 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five officers who fired on Mr Bell were stripped of their guns yesterday and placed on administrative duty while the district attorney decides whether to prosecute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, was shot dead in the early hours of his wedding day when five officers opened fire at his car in an apparent mix-up outside the Kalua Cabaret strip club in Queens on Saturday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said that undercover officers had been monitoring the club for prostitution. An officer was tipped off that a gunfight was about to break out and followed Mr Bell and his friends outside at about 4am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fight began outside, with Mr Bell and several other men allegedly shouting at someone else. One officer reported that he heard one of the men shout: &quot;Yo, go get my gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer followed the men as they got into Mr Bell's car. Mr Bell allegedly drove forward, brushing past the officer, before hitting an unmarked police surveillance van as he turned the corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, the first officer, who was in plain clothes, then identified himself and fired the first shot. Mr Bell backed the car into a building, then drove forward into the van again. Officers inside the van then responded, firing 50 shots, 21 of which hit the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, who was due to marry his high-school sweetheart and the mother of his two children later in the day, was fatally hit by two shots to the neck and arm. Two other passengers were also hit. One was left in a critical condition. Police did not recover any weapon from the victims. Although the victims were black, officials rejected accusations of racism.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NUEVA YORK -- Las autoridades de Nueva York dijeron creer que es demasiado pronto para concluir si estuvo justificado el controversial tiroteo ocurrido el s&aacute;bado en el que sus agentes mataron a un hombre que se iba a casar horas m&aacute;s tarde, pero se&ntilde;al&oacute; que hay indicios de que los agentes actuaron de forma preventiva. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agentes de la polic&iacute;a de Nueva York dispararon la madrugada del s&aacute;bado unas 50 balas contra un autom&oacute;vil donde viajaban tres hombres desarmados que acababan de salir de una despedida de soltero en un club de desnudistas, matando al novio e hiriendo a dos de sus acompa&ntilde;antes, uno de ellos un hispano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Los proyectiles alcanzaron al veh&iacute;culo 21 ocasiones despu&eacute;s que el conductor atropell&oacute; a un polic&iacute;a de civil y choc&oacute; contra una furgoneta policial en dos ocasiones la madrugada del s&aacute;bado, dijo la fuerza p&uacute;blica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El comisionado de la Polic&iacute;a de Nueva York, Raymond Kelly, dijo que es prematuro indicar si el homicidio estuvo justificado y no quiso aclarar si las colisiones motivaron los disparos de los agentes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">En una declaraci&oacute;n, el alcalde Michael Bloomberg dijo que los agentes creyeron que uno de los ocupantes del veh&iacute;culo podr&iacute;a ir armado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aunque es demasiado pronto para sacar conclusiones sobre el tiroteo ... sabemos que los agentes de la NYPD (polic&iacute;a neoyorquina) ten&iacute;an razones para creer que estaba a punto de ocurrir un altercado en el que estar&iacute;a envuelta un arma de fuego e intentaron evitarlo&quot;, afirm&oacute; Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly aclar&oacute; que el incidente estuvo relacionado con una operaci&oacute;n encubierta dentro del club de desnudistas. Varios agentes de civil investigaban el Cabaret Kalua y cinco de ellos participaron en el tiroteo. Las balas alcanzaron adem&aacute;s varias viviendas cercanas y una estaci&oacute;n ferroviaria, aunque no hubo otros heridos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Un agente veterano dispar&oacute; su arma 31 veces, vaciando dos cargadores completos, seg&uacute;n Kelly. Todos los agentes portan pistolas semiautom&aacute;ticas calibre 9 mm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">El novio, que era el conductor, era </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> de 23 a&ntilde;os. Joseph Guzm&aacute;n, de 31, iba en el asiento delantero y recibi&oacute; por lo menos 11 balazos, por lo que se encuentra en estado cr&iacute;tico. Trent Benefield, de 23, que iba en el asiento trasero, fue alcanzado tres veces. Su condici&oacute;n es estable. Ambos se encuentran en el Hospital de Mar&iacute;a Inmaculada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly dijo que quiz&aacute; viajara en el veh&iacute;culo una cuarta persona, que habr&iacute;a huido del lugar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tres agentes, entre ellos el alcanzado por el autom&oacute;vil, fueron atendidos en un centro m&eacute;dico y dados de alta. Otro detective sigue hospitalizado por hipertensi&oacute;n, indic&oacute; Kelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Un jurado investigador indaga el incidente. Kelly dijo que ninguno de los cinco veteranos agentes hab&iacute;a disparado hasta ahora su arma en acto de servicio. No pudo entrevistar a los agentes porque el fiscal municipal debe completar antes su investigaci&oacute;n, aclar&oacute; el comisionado.</SPAN></P>
