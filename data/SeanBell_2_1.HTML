<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN ANONYMOUS donor gave $100,000 to New York University to create a scholarship in honor of Eugene Marshalik, one of the unarmed auxiliary cops gunned down by a madman in Greenwich Village last week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marshalik, 19, an NYU student, had never met the donor, who approached the university recently and told officials he was &quot;moved by Eugene's story&quot; and &quot;wanted to find a way to honor his memory,&quot; said NYU spokesman John Beckman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marshalik's family members said they were touched by the mystery man's generosity. &quot;The person who did this wants to make a difference,&quot; said Marshalik's father, Boris. &quot;He wants to make the world better. And that's what my son wanted to do.&quot; Kathleen Lucadamo and Rich Schapiro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call for cop breath test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A GROUP of city and state lawmakers reviewing the controversial police killing of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called for a new law that would require Breathalyzer tests for cops who fire their weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Sens. Eric Adams (D-Brooklyn) and Malcolm Smith (D-Queens) told about 50 people at a forum at Medgar Evers College organized by the Tri-Level Task Force on Police Reform that they would push such a law. Brendan Brosh and Robert F. Moore</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VICTIMS OF THE Staten Island ferry tragedy will have to wait even longer for their day in court after city lawyers yesterday appealed a federal judge's decision refusing to limit monetary damages in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city says its liability should be capped at $14 million which was the value of the damaged ferry, the Andrew J. Barberi. Eleven people died in the 2003 crash. John Marzulli</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each case, Michael Contreni, 45, left behind a box that turned out to be a fake, cops said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contreni was picked up March 17 in midtown for allegedly driving with a suspended license and possessing crack. Earlier that day, he had held up a Commerce Bank in Brooklyn Heights, cops said. He got out of jail the next day and allegedly committed two more stickups this week, which netted about $2,800 total, according to a federal complaint. John Marzulli</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY SCOTT SHIFREL DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER With Christina Boyle and Alison Gendar</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE NYPD DETECTIVE who fired the fewest shots among the three indicted in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting may want a separate trial - away from the two cops who face manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer for Detective Marc Cooper told the Daily News that he is weighing whether to make a motion to sever the trial, leaving Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora to be tried together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper is facing only two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and a year behind bars if convicted; the others face a maximum of 25 years in prison. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Severing the case is something we will consider,&quot; attorney Paul Martin told The News a day after the three cops were arraigned for killing an unarmed Bell and wounding two pals on Nov. 25, hours before Bell was to be married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper fired four shots that day; Oliver fired 31 bullets, reloading once, and Isnora, the undercover cop who started the fusillade, fired 11 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Monday's arraignment in Queens Supreme Court, Cooper sat at the same defense table as Oliver and Isnora, but he was physically as far away from them as he could be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin declined to comment on the seating arrangement, which was noted by others in the courtroom. Intentional or not, even the shooting victims' lawyers said it might be in Cooper's interest to try to legally separate his case from the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who would want to be sitting next to Oliver?&quot; said Michael Hardy, lawyer for Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, and his two wounded friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman. &quot;That's a no-brainer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, 35, who fired the fatal shots, was seen partying lavishly the night after a grand jury voted to indict him. Both he and Isnora, 28, were released on $250,000 bail. Cooper, 39, was released without bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with LX.TV, a broadband television network, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said yesterday he still had issues with the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The central question in this incident is, 'Is this an aberration, or is this an indication of a systemic problem?' &quot; he said. &quot;That's what we want to find out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD has hired the Rand Corp. to assess the department's firearms training and firearms discharge review process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, lawyers for the three indicted cops weighed their next move. Martin said he won't seek a venue change and wants to try the case in Queens. Lawyers for the other two officers said they still may seek a change of venue, but legal observers say it would be much harder to do so in Queens than in the Bronx, where four cops charged with shooting and killing Amadou Diallo had their case moved to Albany in 1999 and were eventually acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The chance of them getting the case moved is nil,&quot; said lawyer Marvyn Kornberg, who for a time represented one of the Diallo cops and said Queens judges make lawyers try to pick fair-minded jurors before even applying for a change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would hate to believe we can't find 12 fair people who would decide this case solely on what's presented in the courtroom,&quot; said Oliver's lawyer James Culleton. &quot;That said, I don't know if we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before that happens, defense attorneys likely will ask to see some of the mountain of evidence prosecutors have compiled against the cops and will certainly file a motion with Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman challenging the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A madman walks into a pizza joint and shoots the man behind the counter at point-blank range. He runs into the Greenwich Village street and guns down two unarmed auxiliary cops, pumping six bullets into one, execution-style. That is murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five brave police officers working in plainclothes in a Queens bar notorious for drugs and prostitution believe one of the men they're watching has a gun. The officers, later thinking the man and his companions are trying to run them over with a car, all fire their guns. The hail of 50 bullets leaves one unarmed man dead and two wounded. That is a horrible tragedy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nixzmary Brown's stepfather ties the poor little 7-year-old to a chair and beats her for a month in their Brooklyn apartment. &quot;I pounded her,&quot; he confessed, though he claimed he had no idea how she got the massive head injury that killed her. She was all of 36 pounds when she died. That is murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should not have happened. It may have been a crime, according to the grand jury indictment of two officers for manslaughter and assault and a third for reckless endangerment. The grand jury had the option of charging the cops with murder, but it didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some cops are clearly capable of murder. John Galtieri is a former NYPD officer charged with killing his ex-wife, Jeanne Kane. He turned her into a human punching bag during their horrible marriage, beating her after her father's funeral, when she got sick and in front of their daughter. She got even in divorce court, and he allegedly flipped for a final time. As she sat in a Staten Island parking lot, waiting for her daughter and listening to love songs, police say, Galtieri pulled up in his car and shot her. He then drove around to the other side of her car and fired again. That is murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because hindsight is 20-20, we know the cops who fired at Bell and his friends were wrong. But the cops, from what we know now, believed they were in a fight for their lives, and they didn't have the advantage of hindsight. As Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said yesterday, the cops &quot;didn't set out that night to be involved in the death of an innocent man. They went out to do a good job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics, especially on black radio stations, are flatout accusing the cops of murder. Some audaciously hopeless members of the City Council have likened the black police officers involved in the case to black supervisors during slavery. Talk about your stereotypes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton is reasonable by comparison. As usual, Sharpton stirs the pot, but he also makes a point. He seems never to give cops any benefit of the doubt, even the black ones in this case. But he has a point when he wonders how one cop could empty his gun, reload and fire a total of 31 shots. That act, Sharpton says, could have brought a murder count - something he said Monday he wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the reloading, I would have preferred attempted murder at least,&quot; Sharpton told me yesterday. &quot;But I can live with what the grand jury did, I understand it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trial should tell us what happened that night. It should tell us what Bell and his friends were thinking, and what the cops saw and believed. Until then, it's worth remembering something that's still true, even in New York: Cops, like everybody else, are innocent until proven guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE QUEENS judge chosen to preside over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> police shooting case has a history of slamming cop haters, including one involved in a recent controversial case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman, who gets the case April 11 after his name was plucked randomly out of a drum yesterday, jailed a man who bit a cop, even though imprisonment wasn't mandatory in the 2004 case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also handed down a sentence of 52 years to life in 1990 to Jay Harrison, convicted of murdering two detectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the judge is most hailed by police for his role in jailing William Hodges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accused of shooting a police officer, Hodges became a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre for cops in 2002 after Queens Supreme Court Justice Laura Blackburne freed him on a technicality. Blackburne was eventually thrown off the bench for helping a different suspect escape a detective trying to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hodges' luck seemed to hold when he escaped an assault rap and was convicted only of a minor charge - but Cooperman sentenced him to the maximum year in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Cooperman, who served 10 years in the Assembly and was first elected to the Supreme Court in 1982, was described by one lawyer as a &quot;straight shooter&quot; well-qualified for a controversial case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's highly intelligent and can handle the job,&quot; said the insider, noting that Cooperman has also sentenced police convicted of attacking civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1986, Cooperman sentenced two ex-cops to two-to-six years in prison for torturing a teenage drug suspect with a stun gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crime was &quot;an affront to the honest and honorable police officers who carry out their sworn duties in conformance with the law,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the best things the 73-year-old jurist may have going for him is his age, said another court insider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His career is mostly behind him,&quot; he said, noting that an older judge is less likely to be affected by the highly charged politics of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been blessed with a rich pal to buy him $575 bottles of wine at Nello's, he would have lived to see his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his buddies had no more cash than he did and they celebrated his last hours of bachelorhood with $2 beers at Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events that followed after they left Kalua would never have happened outside Nello's, where there would have been no undercover cops, no 50 shots, no dead groom, no knock from inside the grand jury room door on Friday to signal the jurors had reached a decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word quickly leaked that three cops had been indicted, among them Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, including all the fatal ones. That did not stop Oliver from being out at Nello's on Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the many thoughts that apparently did not enter his mind was how the dead man's fianc&eacute;e might feel if she learned the cop who had just been indicted for killing her intended was out partying a day later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, was in the fourth row in Queens Supreme Court yesterday when there came another knocking at a door, this the door leading in from the holding pen, signaling the time had come for the arraignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Indictment No. 1 of 2007, Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper,&quot; the clerk announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver was the first of the three cops to appear in the doorway, and he hesitated for just a heartbeat. He then strode inside wearing a dark suit, his sallow face looking as if the night at Nello's had left him with a more profound hangover than even the cheapest wine could inflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver reached the end of the defense table and turned to face the judge without surveying the spectators. Paultre-Bell shifted in her seat to get a better view, and her eyes locked on the man who had killed her husband-to-be. Her gaze glimmered with something other than hate, something you could know only if you were her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with all she was feeling, Paultre-Bell must have been asking herself the very question that will ultimately decide this case: What precisely in Oliver's mind prompted him to fire that many times at a carload of unarmed young men?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was it just what the experts call contagious shooting? If so, why did some of the others fire so few times? Did Oliver keep firing because of some psychic disconnect between action and consequences, some astonishing indifference such as evidenced by the night out at Nello's?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or maybe he was partying at Nello's out of some need to regain the good life he had begun to taste as an undercover in Manhattan clubs. Had the one-time bridge-and-tunnel kid come to imagine himself a suave man about town? Had Mr. Cool then lost his cool on a dark and scruffy street in Jamaica?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyer tells us he's simply a cop who truly believed he and his partners were in mortal danger, who in other circumstances might be one of those we hail as a hero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By more than one account, Oliver gave a good performance in his testimony before the grand jury. And a series of police-involved shootings during the final days of deliberations could only have reminded the grand jurors of the dangers our cops face every time they hit the street. A grand juror was seen going into the room on Wednesday with a Daily News headlined &quot;COP SHOT.&quot; The juror arrived the next day with a News headlined &quot;MASSACRE IN VILLAGE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But 31 shots were still 31 shots, and the grand jury went ahead and indicted Oliver for manslaughter along with Isnora, the undercover who sparked the indictment by firing first, and then 10 more times. The third cop was hit only with a misdemeanor charge for his recklessness in sending a stray round into the AirTrain terminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the core of the case remains the question that Paultre-Bell seemed to have no more luck than the rest of us in answering yesterday. Oliver left the courthouse free on bail and the one place he seemed sure not to be headed was Nello's.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jurors who voted indictments in the 50-shot police killing proved capable of making delicate and difficult legal distinctions - a fact that became even clearer yesterday with the unsealing of charges against three cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In judging that Detectives Gescard Isnora and Michael Oliver ought to stand trial for manslaughter, the panel chose not to stretch grossly delinquent police conduct into a murder accusation that might have been impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the grand jury ordered Isnora and Oliver tried on alternative manslaughter counts, one entailing criminal intent and the other recklessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges, appropriately severe, seem designed to allow Queens District Attorney Richard Brown (photo) to proceed with the widest reasonable latitude without overreaching. For good measure, Isnora, the undercover officer who first opened fire on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two companions, and Oliver, who shot 31 times, were also charged with assault for wounding Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third officer, Marc Cooper, was indicted on one count of reckless endangerment for firing a wayward shot into a nearby AirTrain station. The grand jury declined to charge two others who had fired just a handful of times between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately and unfortunately, the case went on trial in the court of public opinion. Representing Bell's family, Guzman and Benefield, the Rev. Al Sharpton said the grand jury should have indicted all the cops to the maximum extent. Detectives' Endowment Association President Michael Palladino said the charges signaled that cops were subject to arrest for firing too many times or for simply having bad aim. Sharpton and Palladino were both wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was no runaway grand jury or whitewash panel. It took a look at a tragedy perpetrated by cops who did great harm despite good intentions. And it concluded there was reason to believe Isnora and Oliver unleashed fatal force without justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown's office has the responsibility of proving, over challenge by defense lawyers, that the grand jury was right beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial should take place in Queens. Talk swirled that the accused might seek a change of venue, arguing they could not get a fair trial in the borough. The idea is premature and unwarranted. The grand jury gave them a fair hearing. There is no reason to think that a Queens trial jury would not do the same.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black radio homed in hard on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> indictments yesterday, with many hosts and listeners saying they didn't go far enough and doubting there will be a conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Harvey of WBLS (107.5 FM) started a light-hearted show from Disney World by bluntly declaring &quot;racism&quot; was behind Bell's November death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and two friends were in a van outside a nightclub when five police officers fired 50 shots toward it. Bell was killed, his two friends injured. The officers said they felt threatened, though all three turned out to be unarmed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of the officers were indicted yesterday on a total of eight counts up to first-degree manslaughter, which carries a maximum of 25 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was more than some hosts expected, but not as much as many wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This won't stop until somebody has the b---- to charge cops with murder,&quot; said James Mtume of WRKS (98.7 FM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WRKS turned three hours of Kesha Monk's time into a special edition of its talk show &quot;Open Line.&quot; Monk joined Mtume, Bob Pickett and Bob Slade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monk echoed a widespread sentiment by saying, &quot;I just don't see how this [shooting] can be justified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was echoed by Denise Hill of WLIB (1190 AM), which along with sister station WBLS ran a news-and-talk special from 11 a.m. to noon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of shots,&quot; said Hill. &quot;That's what I can't get past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswoman Ann Tripp of WBLS/WLIB recalled Amadou Diallo and other cases, noting that many of those deaths ended in acquittals for the police officers involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody cross your fingers and pray,&quot; said Tripp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miss Jones of WQHT also cautioned, &quot;These are just indictments, not convictions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ed Lover, morning host on WWPR (105.1 FM), asked, &quot;How come we're the only ones who get shot?&quot; but also asked listeners to consider the situation for police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting the shooting of two auxiliary officers and gunfire outside the Garden after a basketball game, he urged citizens not to make police jobs more tense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some parents need to put some boots in some butts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt of WWPR said it's important for young people &quot;not to act the fool,&quot; but added, &quot;We have to get out of the mindset that anyone who dresses street is dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton and City Councilman Charles Barron, who talked with Deepa Fernandes on WBAI (99.5 FM) before the indictments were unsealed, both called the charges inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mtume agreed, he had a sharp exchange with Pickett, a former judge, who explained that indictments are guided by what prosecutors feel they can make stick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mtume argued, as he has before, that both the justice system and black leadership need to be overhauled to push for more aggressive prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also need to stop focusing on the puppets and look at the puppeteers,&quot; Mtume added. &quot;You have to change the mentality before you can change actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News stations WCBS-AM (880), WINS (1010 AM) and WNYC (820 AM) carried the indictment announcement live, and WNYC followed with a news special. WABC (770 AM) had a live newscast on the indictments as they were announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real problem here, said Harvey, runs deeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a chilling message every black man feels when he is pulled over by the police,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if it's just for a broken taillight. There's always a moment when you feel this could go wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm 50 years old and I still feel it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT WOULD STILL be some time before the three officers indicted in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> police shooting would be arraigned in court, but the Rev. Al Sharpton wasn't wasting any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not cooperate or testify in a trial outside of Queens County,&quot; he thundered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton threatened to keep the two surviving victims in the police shooting - Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield - from testifying if the trial were moved from Queens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't clear if Sharpton's threat would carry any weight - or even if it's a valid threat, since no lawyer involved in the case has asked for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But defense lawyers have said they would consider the option, and there are those, including union officials representing the detectives, who believe that negative press coverage could prejudice a potential jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes of venue are extremely rare and are decided by a panel of Appellate Division judges, not the trial judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many high-profile defendants whose cases have attracted intense coverage in the media have been tried in the county where their crimes occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the people of Queens could be fair,&quot; said Kenneth Thompson, the former Brooklyn federal prosecutor who led the team that tried cops accused of assaulting Abner Louima with a plunger in a Brooklyn precinct stationhouse in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Louima case, there were 8,000 people who marched over the Brooklyn Bridge, some holding plungers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, uncooperative witnesses could pose serious problems for Queens prosecutors and force witness-stand showdowns. Reluctant witnesses could be subpoenaed, and those who didn't comply could be jailed for contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It could be a nightmare,&quot; said Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said he will try the three detectives in Queens. &quot;The jury should be representative of the diversity of this county,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the defense lawyers, James Culleton, represented an officer in the Amadou Diallo case, which was moved from the Bronx to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diallo, a West African immigrant, was slain by 19 of 41 shots fired by Bronx undercover cops in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Sharpton and other critics of the Diallo outcome, defense attorneys correctly predicted that an Albany jury would be more cop-friendly than one in the Bronx. But attorney Steven Brounstein, who represented acquitted Officer Kenneth Boss, bristles at the suggestion the defense was trying to get an edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were looking for a fair shot,&quot; said Brounstein. &quot;You want people who can go back to their community and not have to worry when you're dealing with a tremendous amount of pretrial publicity that can affect jurors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formal indictment had one surprise element with legal ramifications for the upcoming trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora were hit with first- and second-degree manslaughter charges - rather than just second-degree - means they face mandatory prison time if convicted of the top count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the top count been second-degree manslaughter, the accused cops could feel secure in risking a trial and a guilty verdict - and still perhaps avoid any time behind bars, legal experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the prospect of mandatory prison time hanging over them, there could be impetus for a possible plea deal - even though neither side has indicated they would consider one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE FIRED 31 BULLETS, the other 11. But Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora are joined with the same potential fate: a shocking 25 years behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment in the fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was unsealed yesterday, and the severity of the charges - a top count of first-degree manslaughter, which carries mandatory prison time - surprised insiders, who were expecting a lesser count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet that wasn't enough for some, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who said the death of Bell was nothing short of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly in our judgment there was evidence to reach the level of murder and attempted murder,&quot; Sharpton said at a news conference before the three cops were arraigned in Queens Supreme Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It falls short of what we want,&quot; he added. &quot;All five officers should have been charged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton also warned that the other shooting victims, Bell's pals Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, would not testify if the case were moved out of Queens - further complicating a case that has already inflamed tensions in the African-American community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, a Queens grand jury ended nearly two months of investigation when it voted to indict Oliver, 35, Isnora, 28, and Detective Marc Cooper, 39, in the shooting, and not bring charges against Police Officer Mike Carey, who fired three shots, and Detective Paul Headley, who fired one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver and Isnora face the most serious charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter, as well as first-degree assault charges stemming from the wounding of Guzman and Benefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the grand jury's findings were secret, reports widely held that Oliver and Isnora would be charged with second-degree manslaughter, which is punishable by anywhere from 15 years down to just probation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that this office and this grand jury got the result that was most appropriate,&quot; Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in a morning press conference announcing the charges. &quot;This was a case that was I'm sure not easy to resolve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield, 23, Guzman, 31, and Bell, 23, were among those who were celebrating Bell's bachelor party on Nov. 25, the same night a special undercover team that included Oliver, Cooper and Isnora was investigating the Kalua Cabaret for guns, drugs and prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora, who fired the first shot, later told cops he followed the group from the strip club after seeing a dispute, and identified himself after they got into Bell's car, according to a police report. He only fired after he thought Guzman went for a gun, he has maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman and Benefield disputed that version, saying the cops never identified themselves and that nobody went for a gun. No weapon was ever found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, politicians and activists mixed with others holding signs calling for murder charges, remembering Bell or decrying racism because the victims were all African-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside, the ceremonial 250-seat courtroom was a tough ticket and lines wound through the Kew Gardens courthouse secured by white-shirted court officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield and Guzman, still suffering from the bullet wounds, and Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, craned their necks as the three cops were led inside, uncuffed, and sat by their lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petite Paultre-Bell sat next to Sharpton and glared at Oliver, who fired the shots that a coroner determined killed the man she was to marry hours later. Neither Oliver, Cooper - who fired four times - nor Isnora said anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers' families sat behind them holding hands and wiping tears, some wearing sunglasses and grim faces, while on the other side of the courtroom, Bell's mother, Valerie, comforted his father, William Bell Jr., as Bell's aunt wiped away tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court clerk's clear voice broke the harsh silence of the courtroom as he read the eight counts of manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment. Prosecutor Peter Reiss asked for $250,000 bail for Oliver and Isnora, and $2,500 for Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three officers pleaded not guilty. The only argument came from Cooper's lawyer, Paul Martin, who asked that his client be released on his own recognizance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has an unblemished career,&quot; he said, adding that his wife and children were in the courtroom and he would return to court without bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative Judge Randall Eng agreed and released Cooper, who faces a year in jail, without bail and set $250,000 bond for the others. They made bail, with help from their police union, minutes after the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today was just a baby step in this long road we have ahead of us,&quot; Paultre-Bell said afterward, holding back tears. &quot;We're here to fight and we're going to continue to pray for justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman, who dramatically stood from his wheelchair for the first time in public since the shooting as he spoke briefly with reporters, agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was not a victory,&quot; Guzman said. &quot;It's hollow, that's all it is. I want everyone to know that we lost somebody dear and we're going to fight all the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, defense lawyers and police union officials blasted the charges as &quot;excessive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very dark day for all our detectives and the NYPD,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association. &quot;This is more chilling than I had originally thought. . . . If you can't get it done in three shots or less, you're in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers were &quot;very somber,&quot; their lawyers said. Oliver's lawyer also defended the detective's lavish night out at an expensive trendy East Side restaurant Saturday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case will be tried on what happened on Nov. 25 on Liverpool St.,&quot; lawyer James Culleton said. &quot;It will not be tried on my client being followed around or attending dinners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eng, who randomly selected Queens Supreme Court Justice Arthur Cooperman as the trial judge, ordered the three officers back to court on April 11.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT WAS A &quot;SLAP IN THE FACE&quot; for the cop accused of firing 31 shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to party at an East Side hot spot just a day after he was indicted in the fatal shooting, Bell's pastor said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver shocked even his supporters when he dined on $180 pasta with truffles and $575 bottles of wine at celebrity hangout Nello's on Saturday night - racking up a $4,200 bill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Him going out and celebrating and having a party, [he's saying], 'Hey, there's nothing to this,' &quot; said the Rev. Lester Williams of Community Baptist Church of Christ in Jamaica, Queens, where Bell was supposed to get married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a slap in the face to us,&quot; Williams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, 35, will be arraigned today on manslaughter charges along with Detective Gescard Isnora, 28, in the killing of Bell outside a Queens strip club on Nov. 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Marc Cooper, 39, faces reckless endangerment charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of the victims blasted Oliver for going out for a night on the town with a friend from Spain and two beauties so soon after a grand jury charged him on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't really know what he was celebrating,&quot; said Denise Ford, whose son Trent Benefield, 23, was shot and wounded alongside Bell, 23, and a third friend, Joseph Guzman, 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a young man under the ground,&quot; said Les Paultre, whose daughter Nicole would have married Bell. &quot;I'd think you'd like to show some kind of respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police insiders say Oliver showed incredibly bad judgment by indulging in $65 Dover sole at a high-profile restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He just got himself convicted,&quot; said one police union official. &quot;We have to rein him in before he gets the other guys convicted, too. It's all about perception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His lawyer will sit him down and talk to him,&quot; added another police source. &quot;I guarantee this won't happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party-boy image may not directly affect the cops' case, but public perception can sway high-profile jury trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even supporters of the accused cops say the three have been warned to avoid appearing to thumb their noses at the victim and the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the accused cops asked whether they could attend the St. Patrick's Day Parade - and were told to stay out of the public eye, sources said. &quot;This has come up before,&quot; a police union insider said. &quot;He and the others have been told to lay low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton said Oliver's taste for fine wine raises a legitimate question about whether cops were drinking the night of the Bell shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most striking thing is the amount of alcohol,&quot; said Sharpton, pointing to reports of the dinner that had four people downing five bottles of wine. &quot;How much alcohol was consumed on the night </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But detectives union chief Michael Palladino hit back at Sharpton, saying he has a &quot;warped mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver was not inside the strip club and has not been accused of drinking that night, Palladino said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also suggested that Mayor Bloomberg's comments after the shooting that the 50 shots &quot;sounds like excessive force&quot; could provide legal grounds to move the trial out of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will examine all of our options, including a change of venue,&quot; he told WABC/Channel 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino also took a subtle shot at Bell and two buddies, who faced off with cops as they came out of the Kalua Cabaret in Jamaica, a notorious strip joint. &quot;There is a distinct difference between going to dinner with friends and partying in a dump called the club Kalua, which is overrun with drugs, guns and prostitution,&quot; Palladino told the Daily News.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONG BEFORE </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed in a barrage of bullets outside a seedy strip club, Queens had been roiled by cases involving police wounding or killing other unarmed men of color. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federico Pereira was choked to death in 1991 while handcuffed. Lebert Folkes Jr. was shot in the face and survived in 1996. Steven Excell died after being shot in the back of the head the same year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the police officers involved in those cases were cleared of wrongdoing under the jurisdiction of Queens District Attorney Richard Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his 15 years as Queens' top prosecutor, Brown has developed a reputation to some as being pro-cop, particularly in cases where the stakes are the highest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in securing indictments against three NYPD detectives in the Bell shooting, Brown has an opportunity to change that image, real or perceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone in Queens knows he's a thoughtful and intelligent district attorney,&quot; said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. &quot;There was no rush to indict . . . . He defined the process, instead of letting external players do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real challenge for Brown will come at trial - because other investigations involving cops in Queens typically end at the grand jury level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, police wrongly thought Folkes had stolen a car and confronted him in Far Rockaway. They described the shooting as an accident. An officer's gun went off as Folkes struggled with the officers, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens prosecutors presented evidence to a grand jury, including conflicting accounts of what happened. No charges were filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors also presented testimony surrounding the death of Excell to a grand jury but didn't get an indictment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer said his gun discharged accidentally as he tried to pull Excell from beneath a parked car in Jamaica. Excell allegedly was hiding under the car from cops called to check a report that he beat his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dick Brown's reputation is one of excessive favoritism to the police,&quot; lawyer and radio commentator Ron Kuby said. &quot;He has promised evenhanded justice but has rarely delivered in cases of police shootings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the choking death of Pereira, a grand jury did indict Officer Anthony Paparella in the murder of the suspected car thief. Four other officers were alleged to have played lesser roles but were indicted for murder for &quot;acting in concert&quot; with Paparella.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reviewing the case, Brown successfully petitioned a judge to drop the charges against all but Paparella, citing insufficient evidence. His office took Paparella to trial on a lesser charge of manslaughter - but Paparella was acquitted in a non-jury trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet political consultant Norman Adler noted Queens has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its traditional white, Catholic ethnic base has been diminishing for years, so if you are going to be an elected leader, you have to be sensitive to the minority voters who may very well be a majority,&quot; Adler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, there's little dispute that Brown - whom many call &quot;Judge&quot; in a nod to his years on the bench, including a stint in the Appellate Division - will carry out his mission to enforce the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Moss noted, Brown &quot;comes across as a guy who is trustworthy.&quot; pdonohue@nydailynews.com</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE WEE hours of Nov. 25, two days after Thanksgiving, the Kalua Cabaret club was jammed with men appreciating the performances of several strippers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who would be dead before the sun rose, killed in a fusillade of 50 police bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When three of the cops involved in the fatal shooting were indicted Friday, the Kalua Cabaret was like a morgue. Only a handful of customers were around the dimly lit bar, sipping drinks and watching a stripper go through her paces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the grand jury's decision elicited strong emotions. &quot;It's a start. Now let's investigate the whole precinct,&quot; said a bar manager, who described himself as a friend of Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cop who emptied his gun and reloaded should do time for all of them. Bottom line,&quot; a balding bouncer said, referring to Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 shots and was hit with manslaughter charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A maintenance man who lives nearby said, &quot;Now, the cops will know they can't just roll on us. There are consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others seemed not to care. Asked what she thought, a stripper with smudged eyeliner flashed her G-string and replied, &quot;Oh, I don't know about that. But you're beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">572 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tomorrow's unsealing of the indictments of three detectives from the botched undercover operation that killed unarmed citizen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a hail of bullets will do a world of good for New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The age-old tools of trial procedure - stringent rules of evidence, examination and cross-examination of witnesses before a carefully selected jury - will surely uncover the truth of what happened outside Kalua Cabaret on that tragic morning last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the lawyers, victims and defendants prepare for trial, the rest of us should take a hard look at the poor state of police-community relations in our city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, as the grand jury convened to deliberate on possible indictments, NYPD Commissioner Kelly mobilized 1,700 extra officers and pronounced them &quot;available if we want to deploy them&quot; to quell potential civil unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is a sad and telling commentary on New York's supposedly hunky-dory race relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If everything were fine, there would be no need to order up armed platoons. And if everything's not fine, as the nervousness at One Police Plaza suggests, we should quit all the happy-talk about how police-community tensions have improved since the days of Mayor Rudy Giuliani and work at really making sure cops and law-abiding black and Latino New Yorkers feel like they are all on the same side, fighting the crooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One important step would be to take seriously the rising tide of complaints from citizens about hostile encounters with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Independent Budget Office, the Civilian Complaint Review Board received 6,358 complaints about police behavior last year, a 25% jump from 5,089 in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the budget office says 2,080 police misconduct lawsuits were filed against the city in fiscal year 2004, an increase of 12% from the year before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A department that famously brought crime to heel by the aggressive use of crime-incident statistics should publish maps of these complaints and lawsuits - and let precinct commanders know that reducing confrontations between cops and civilians will be a key part of the formula for advancement in the NYPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another step in the right direction would be to acknowledge the beneficial, often controversial role played by community leaders like Councilman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn) and the Revs. Herbert Daughtry and Al Sharpton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trio and their allies routinely get reviled as publicity-hunting rabble-rousers or worse. But street activists have a long, successful history in New York of voicing the wild, bitter frustration that bubbles and boils in inner-city neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though they are never, ever thanked for it, tough-talking activists have long provided a kind of verbal, public steam release: rhetoric rather that riots. That's part of the reason why modern New York has never exploded in full-blown riots over police abuse the way cities like Los Angeles, Miami and Cincinnati have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never tell people to be cool, passive or docile,&quot; Daughtry told me in the hours before the Bell grand jury completed its deliberations. &quot;It's okay to be angry. In the face of oppression, you're supposed to be angry. I counsel righteous indignation and tell people to express it through a constructive route&quot; like voter registration, boycotts and rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of that, plus a fair and orderly trial, will help resolve this latest questionable police killing - and maybe inspire some honest talk about how to prevent the next one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days before Detective Michael Oliver is to surrender to face manslaughter charges, he stepped outside his family's Clifton, N.J., home only to shovel snow off the driveway, his lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the Hudson River, demonstrators marched from Union Square to Police Headquarters protesting the Nov. 25 shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury voted Friday to indict Oliver and Detective Gescard Isnora on manslaughter charges and Detective Marc Cooper on a reckless endangerment charge in connection with the shooting that killed Bell on his wedding day. The indictments will be unsealed tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the trial begins, the Rev. Al Sharpton said, the men who survived the shooting - Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31 - expect the defense to wage a campaign of character assassination against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The downside is, they are going to come back . . . at these victims,&quot; Sharpton said on his radio show in Harlem. &quot;They're going to to try to make them look like the worst people that ever lived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops are expected to turn themselves in to authorities at Queens Supreme Court at 7 a.m. tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Michael Hardy, an attorney for Benefield and Guzman, predicted it will be at least a year before the detectives go on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The victims will try to survive in an environment where they have a target on their backs,&quot; Hardy said at Sharpton's Harlem headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other cops who fired their guns outside the Kalua Cabaret strip club, Detective Paul Headley and Officer Mike Carey, were not indicted - though they could face NYPD disciplinary charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said Guzman, Benefield and Bell's family derived no joy from the indictments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is there ain't no pleasure in watching people having a perp walk,&quot; he said. &quot;It only reminds us how vulnerable we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on New Yorkers to support Guzman and Benefield - both of whom have criminal records - during the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever they say about Guzman and Benefield, [they] didn't shoot anybody,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The jury needs to see that the community is outraged by the crimes that have been committed. We must have an organized court presence. . . . We must be out in full force to protect justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in Union Square, City Councilman Charles Barron (D-East New York) was much harsher and far more inflammatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't blame me for the explosion, because we're not taking this for much longer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the system doesn't protect us, we have to protect ourselves from killer cops by any means necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is firm, and he is looking forward to his day in court,&quot; his lawyer said. &quot;We're confident he'll be vindicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four times, was charged with reckless endangerment, sources said. He was with loved ones when he learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's with his family, explaining the situation, preparing for the surrender,&quot; Cooper's attorney, Paul Martin, said yesterday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was surprised, shocked and disappointed,&quot; Martin said of the 17-year veteran narcotics detective. &quot;It's been a tough time for him waiting for the grand jury's decision. His family is disappointed as well. But they are supporting him and standing by his side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver also was charged with second-degree manslaughter, according to sources. Oliver, a tall, handsome cop who is known around the Chelsea club scene as &quot;Undercover Mike,&quot; quickly became the face of the controversial shooting after word leaked out that he had fired 31 times, reloading his gun in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am disappointed my client was indicted,&quot; said James Culleton, Oliver's lawyer. &quot;But it was not unexpected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver spent last night with his family, and like the other officers involved, had never fired his weapon before the Nov. 25 clash near the Kalua Cabaret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Paul Headley and Officer Mike Carey were not indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm very relieved,&quot; said Carey's mother, Kathleen Carey, 54, at her home in Valley Stream, L.I. &quot;It's been a long ordeal. I love my son. I've always believed in his innocence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyer, Stephen Worth, defended Carey's actions, but said the grand jury should have refused to indict all the cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the district attorney was overly fixated on the number of shots fired,&quot; Worth said. &quot;They called the officers into the grand jury in the order of how many shots were fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If an officer is justified in firing, then he is justified in firing until he believes the threat has ended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't immediately clear when Headley and Carey - who like the other three officers have been on paid leave - would be allowed to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NYPD spokesman declined to comment on their status until the indictment is unsealed Monday. A law enforcement source said it was unlikely either Carey or Headley would get their guns back and be allowed to return to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the very least, the officers who were not indicted will be placed on modified duty until the trial is over,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers and union officials said the indictments against the three detectives should not be viewed as an indicator of guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The level of proof needed to indict is extremely low,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association. &quot;As they say, they can indict a ham sandwich or even a rock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino suggested the indictment could make cops less aggressive or effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The message being sent by these indictments will have a chilling effect not only on New York City detectives, and New York City police, but law enforcement across the country . . .,&quot; Palladino said. &quot;The message is being sent now that even though you are acting in good faith, there is no room, no margin for error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No officer wants to be the next Mike Oliver or Marc Cooper,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the seven NYPD officers associated with the four major fatal shootings of unarmed men since 1999, only one has been found guilty of criminal charges and removed from duty. The rest still work for the city or have retired from public jobs. None of the officers was allowed to carry a gun again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMADOU DIALLO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Kenneth Boss was among four officers who fired 41 shots at West African immigrant Amadou Diallo, 22, on Feb. 4, 1999, as Diallo reached for his wallet in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four officers were acquitted after a criminal trial. Boss works for the NYPD Emergency Service Unit and is suing to carry a gun again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Sean Carroll is retired from the police aviation unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Richard Murphy is now a firefighter in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Edward McMellon is now a firefighter in Brooklyn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TIMOTHY STANSBURY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Housing Officer Richard Neri fatally shot Timothy Stansbury, 19, on Jan. 24, 2004, as the teen walked across the roof of a Brooklyn housing project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury declined to indict Neri. He has a desk job at Patrol Borough, Brooklyn North, and is now a Patrolmen's Benevolent Association delegate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUSMANE ZONGO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Officer Bryan Conroy shot and killed Ousmane Zongo, 43, on May 22, 2003, during a confrontation with the African immigrant in a Manhattan storage facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conroy was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and was sentenced to five years' probation and community service. He was fired from the force but is appealing the conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PATRICK DORISMOND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Anthony Vasquez shot Patrick Dorismond, 26, on March 16, 2000, outside a Manhattan bar following a scuffle that broke out after a fellow undercover cop asked Dorismond where he could buy drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against Vasquez. His current status is not available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no rush to judgment in the indictments that were voted yesterday in the fatal police shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a painstaking investigation, a Queens grand jury charged two detectives with manslaughter and one with reckless endangerment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having listened to more than 60 witnesses, including the accused, the grand jurors concluded that the detectives were horribly, criminally delinquent when they fired at the unarmed 23-year-old and his companions. No one has looked more closely at the events of that night. The decision to remand Detectives Gescard Isnora, Marc Cooper and Michael Oliver for trial must be respected - as must the grand jury's vote against charging two other cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the start, it has been plain the five-member undercover team had at the very least fallen short of NYPD standards when they let loose with 50 shots in a tragic encounter with Bell outside a nightclub. Beyond that, the grand jurors were given the onerous responsibility of deciding whether the cops' conduct warranted charging them with breaking the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down the road, barring guilty pleas, trial juries will be asked to determine whether the charges stand up beyond a reasonable doubt. Only then will the matter be settled - and it is important to let the process play out with the same level of care that Queens District Attorney Richard Brown and the grand jury appear to have applied thus far. Facts and the law must prevail, not passions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many who believe that the accused officers are the victims of an enormous injustice. That they were simply doing their jobs under dangerous circumstances. That to charge them is to engage in unconscionable second-guessing. That a cop should not have to worry about going to jail for making a good-faith, if tragic, mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also many who long ago concluded that all five cops are murderers. That, being cops, they automatically harbored racist sentiments when dealing with Bell, a black man - even though several of them are black themselves. That justice will be served only if all five are convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alas, the city has not heard the last of the rage that began boiling yesterday. But this is a time for cooler heads as three men, and no, not five, are held to account.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE THREE detectives indicted in the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> face an uphill legal battle fraught with tough decisions that may ultimately decide the case, legal experts said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can they get a fair trial in Queens or should they seek a change of venue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Request a trial by judge or jury? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To testify or not to testify?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do not underestimate how difficult it is to defend a police officer,&quot; said defense lawyer John Scarpa, a former Queens assistant district attorney who 20 years ago prosecuted cops in the infamous 106th Precinct stun-gun torture case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jurors are predisposed to hold cops to a higher standard, so although the prosecutor has the burden to prove they're guilty, the burden probably shifts in police cases, and cops have to show their actions were reasonable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Detectives Gescard Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper are booked, their mug shots taken and they are released on bail Monday, the march to trial begins with a review of the grand jury presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense sources believe Isnora and Oliver are charged with manslaughter and Cooper with reckless endangerment, although the indictment remains sealed. The grand jurors simply concluded that there was more evidence than not that the detectives had committed a crime - a far lower standard than the reasonable doubt threshold at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though all five cops involved in the Nov. 25 shooting testified before the grand jury, experts say it's no shock three were unable to head off an indictment, since defense lawyers couldn't cross-examine witnesses or put their spin on the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The defense should be able to turn this on its head at trial,&quot; said attorney Joseph Tacopina. &quot; 'Reckless' is a very subjective term. There's no question there was some improper conduct by the victims, and the cops thought their lives were in danger,&quot; he noted, referring to Bell driving his auto toward Isnora and a police van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming weeks, the defense will file motions to review the grand jury minutes for legal errors, followed by the release of a mountain of forensic reports and statements made by cops and witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally know [that] the assistant district attorney in charge of the investigation, Charles Testagrossa, is a person of the highest integrity, and I am certain he did his best to make a fair presentation to the grand jury,&quot; Scarpa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cops cleared in the 1999 fatal shooting of unarmed Amadou Diallo successfully transferred the trial from the Bronx to Albany, but any decision to change the venue in this case won't be made until after the defense has reviewed the evidence and learned which Supreme Court justice will preside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think a change of venue motion would be appropriate, especially if the negative publicity continues,&quot; said attorney Steve Brounstein, who defended Officer Kenneth Boss in the Diallo case. &quot;This is going to be a fight, but they don't have to make those decisions now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deciding whether a defendant will testify is usually a trial-time decision, but it is virtually certain the detectives' best chance of acquittal rests on justifying their actions in their own words, the experts agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides also will line up experts on police tactics and firearms training to argue that the officers violated procedures or reacted as best they could to a chaotic situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police shootings by multiple officers are not always clear-cut because of their different perceptions of what's happening,&quot; said retired NYPD Capt. Edward Mamet, who has testified as an expert in police practices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources told the Daily News that two face second-degree manslaughter charges while another was hit with reckless endangerment in the notorious 50-shot barrage that took the life of Bell, just hours before he was to be married, and injured two others. All were unarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queens grand jury's decision - capping an investigation that heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses, including all five cops involved - was met with a mixture of shock, disappointment and grim determination, from all sides. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the victims, the Rev. Al Sharpton vowed that Bell's friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman - both injured in the police fusillade - were preparing for courtroom &quot;warfare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trent and Joe [Guzman] have to testify,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;They have to prepare to get on the stand and prepare for the defense lawyers. They're getting ready for warfare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's parents were described as &quot;full of emotion&quot; as they heard the result of the grand jury's deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the cops, however, there was disappointment, resignation and a pledge to fight for their innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora were hit with manslaughter charges; Detective Marc Cooper will have to fight at least one count of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two others - Detective Paul Headley and Officer Mike Carey - were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver, 35, fired 31 shots into Bell's car on Nov. 25, including the two that killed the 23-year-old groom-to-be as he and his friends left Kalua Cabaret, a strip club in Jamaica, Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora, 28, started the shooting and fired 11 shots. Cooper, 39, fired four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment will be unsealed Monday, and the three officers are expected to surrender and prepare for an arraignment that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five cops were part of a team conducting undercover operations at Kalua Cabaret, where Bell was having his bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora told investigators he saw a dispute between two groups and heard a man later identified as Guzman ask for a gun, according to a police report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He followed the group and saw them enter Bell's 1999 Nissan Altima. All five officers closed in as Isnora identified himself, he told investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was clipped by the car and said he saw Guzman go for a weapon when he began firing his 9-mm. pistol at the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts predicted that if anyone was going to be indicted it would be Isnora, who fired first, and Oliver, who fired 31 times and reloaded once. Both face as much as 15 years in prison if convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprise was Cooper, who fired just four shots and was often grouped with Carey, who fired three times, and Headley, who fired just once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cooper may have sealed his own fate when he took the stand before the grand jury last week, according to a source familiar with his testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was nervous, and he got a little confused,&quot; the source said. &quot;He said he didn't see where the threat was coming from and stuck his hand out and fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously that's reckless endangerment. He tried to go back and clarify it, but once it came out, he was stuck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper faces much less time in jail, possibly as little as a year, though it was unclear what degree of reckless endangerment the grand jury voted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the thought of officers, who among them had made hundreds of arrests and who had never before fired their weapons in the line of duty, being indicted was shocking, their representatives said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the type of case that has to be tried, there's no plea bargaining here,&quot; said Oliver's lawyer, James Culleton. &quot;It's just the beginning. These detectives are going to stand up and fight these charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg, blasted last year by police for calling the shooting &quot;excessive,&quot; and Queens District Attorney Richard Brown had spoken to each other after the grand jury decision, but neither would offer public comment yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insiders said lead prosecutor Charles Testagrossa and his team are hunkering down for what will likely be increased scrutiny from police, victims and community leaders as they prepare for Monday's arraignment before Queens Administrative Judge Randall Eng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a mixed bag,&quot; said one law enforcement source involved with the case, noting there is no time for relief or joy over the grand jury's decision because the trial looms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE REV. AL Sharpton said there was &quot;no joy&quot; in the victims' camp over the indictment of three of the five cops in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the Queens apartment complex where one of the wounded men lives, residents were sipping Moet champagne from plastic cups last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're laughing right now - but we have so much pain,&quot; said a 36-year-old tenant who joined the impromptu celebration at Baisley Park Gardens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters in Harlem, reaction was more muted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, stood silently with his wounded pals, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no joy, no vengeance, no party here,&quot; Sharpton declared. &quot;We are not looking for revenge. We are looking for it to not happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way you make sure it doesn't happen again is you stop it, and you punish it, and you send a signal that we live in a society where laws have to be respected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said he took &quot;no pleasure&quot; in the fact that the families of Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper will have to endure a trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even invoked the memory of the two auxiliary police officers executed in cold blood in Greenwich Village this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the ugliest things that occurred was the killing of those auxiliary police the other night,&quot; he said. &quot;But it was just as ugly for the police to break the law and shoot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After word of the indictments leaked out, it was Sharpton who told Bell's fianc&eacute;e, whom he was to marry the day he was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nicole was quiet and somber and reflective,&quot; he said. &quot;Joe [Guzman] was more expressive. He was like, 'Okay, let's go.' Trent was quiet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer for Guzman, Benefield and Paultre-Bell said they had hoped for charges against all five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But attorney Michael Hardy said indictments for the two responsible for the most shots - Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Isnora, who fired 11 - &quot;were nonnegotiable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are encouraged by the rumors of who was indicted and what the charges are,&quot; Hardy said. &quot;The family is more hopeful today than yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family members, friends and neighbors were disappointed but not enraged that the two cops who fired the fewest shots - Officer Michael Carey and Detective Paul Headley - won't be charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll take the sliding scale,&quot; said Bishop Lester Williams, who was supposed to preside at Bell's wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mostly, they sounded grateful that someone will be held accountable for Bell's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people have been on edge about it,&quot; said Bishop Erskine Williams, a spokesman for Benefield and Guzman. &quot;But I think the fever is breaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that people are going to now regain their confidence in the criminal justice system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also emphasized that the grand jury action is just the first step in a long process with an uncertain ending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's still not over,&quot; said Guzman's sister, Yolanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's good to see, but nothing that happens can bring Sean back and nothing can get my brother back to the way he was. He is a different man now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was also the sentiment at La Bella Vita catering hall, where Bell's wedding reception would have been held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It still hurts, and I will never forget how terrible the day Sean died was,&quot; said owner Tony Modica. &quot;Nothing can bring him back, but today we saw the law begin to do what is right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg just couldn't leave well enough alone, could he?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following this week's indictment of three cops in the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayor Mike declared that he stood behind his initial public assessment of the incident, when he declared that the officers had used &quot;excessive force.&quot;   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mayor also had called the shooting &quot;unacceptable.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the initial uproar over his comments, Bloomberg took care not to repeat them. This week, however, he insisted that &quot;I expressed my opinion as a layman, which I have a right to do.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, Mike, but the mayor of New York isn't just your average Joe Citizen.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when he weighs in on potentially criminal matters involving New York City police officers - especially a situation that threatens to ignite simmering tensions in the city - he is far from &quot;a layman.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be surprised, in other words, if lawyers for the indicted cops pounce on Bloomberg's latest pronouncement as the basis for a legal motion to move the trial out of the five boroughs - just as the trial of the cops who shot Amadou Diallo was moved to Albany.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They'd likely be on pretty solid ground.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Not that the mayor seems to understand this. In the same interview, he said that Queens DA Richard Brown &quot;is the one who will decide as to whether or not there is a need for a change in venue.&quot; In fact, the call gets made made by judges on the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court.)  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point here is that Mike Bloomberg, like every other citizen, is entitled to have opinions about anything and everything under the sun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as chief executive of the city, he needs to think first and consider all the possible repercussions before sharing those opinions with the public. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOU'VE read Martha Stewart's prepping special foods for gentleman friend Charles Simonyi, who's pay  ing $25 million to do a few laps in outer space. This lady is very into good dining. While he's whizzing around celestially noshing on her duck-and-gravy menus, you shouldn't think she's going without food. Even before he splits for his weekend in downtown Jupiter (must be all the hotels and motels in Delray Beach were already full, right?), she was hitting a luncheonette in the 80s on Lex. Alone. We're talking Friday, midday mealtime, like 12:30. Miss Martha took the farthest seat at the counter. And ordered a turkey club. Triple-decker. I thought only my mouth was large enough for that. Plus a lime rickey. I knew you'd want to know.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOMORROW night, NBC premieres the game show &quot;Identity.&quot; A takeoff on the '60s &quot;What's My Line,&quot; its producer Ben Silverman (who brought us &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;) picked people like the Craig's List guy and Star magazine Editrix-in-Chief Bonnie Fuller. For some reason, Bonnie was the toughest to guess. I thought you'd maybe want to know this, too.      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TODAY we pay tribute to Naomi Campbell. Ungracious folk who took cellphones in the head have caused fashionista Naomi to mop those unchic floors of the Sanitation Department. May all turn toward Seventh Avenue and offer up a prayer. Brethren and Sistren, let us bow our heads to Our Lady of the Peplum.      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, so, now, Boy George. Back when he was doing community service Boy-oh-Boy was nervous. Not about the job they'd make him do, but about the outfit they'd make him wear. He fretted over the possibilities of a polyester orange jumpsuit. &quot;I don't look good in orange,&quot; he whimpered. &quot;And that shape is not for my build. I have short legs, which don't come off well in a jumper cut.&quot;     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleaning johns has surfaced in many celebrity lives. Early on Puffy Combs washed bathrooms in a Mexican restaurant. He says: &quot;It was a job, but I tell you one thing. I was the best bathroom cleaner there ever was.&quot; . . . Hugh Grant's worst employment? Spiffing up the &quot;lavatories at IBM in London.&quot; . . . Al Pacino? Once earned four dollars a week doing toilets in N.Y.C. . . . It was also one of Chris Tucker's entry-level employments . . . Nicole Kidman: &quot;I was an usher at the Capital Theatre in Sydney. When the latrine broke, I had to wipe it up. Not fun. I was on hands and knees. Who knew that was in the job description?&quot; . . . Stanley Tucci told New York magazine he worked in a Westchester summer camp's outhouses. &quot;I was just out of school. When you're young, you can handle anything for three months.&quot;     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As his career began, Quentin Tarantino landed &quot;production assistant&quot; on a workout video. His first assignment was removing dog poop from a lawn where the video was shooting . . . Madonna's high school money came from cleaning houses: &quot;I had to scrub the toilet bowls of boys I went to school with. Nothing's more degrading.&quot; . . . Jamie Kennedy on those first days in Hollywood: &quot;I cleaned Janeane Garofalo's bathroom, which was pretty funky. I'd do one pre-scrub then one real scrub. But on her tub, three pre-scrubs and two scrubs.&quot;     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's Aida Turturro, who told Webster Hall curator Baird Jones: &quot;I love to clean, to organize and get rid of disorder. I clean for hours just for fun. I worked my way through college cleaning houses. I loved it.&quot; Aida, hon, maybe you could stop over my place?     </SPAN></P>

In 1954, with a Dr. Sam Sheppard indicted for murdering his wife, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled proceedings must move to where a fair trial can be had when intense pretrial publicity suggests the accused mightn't get an honest shake.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Appellate Division did precisely that in the Amadou Diallo trial after Sharpton orchestrated a 40-day headline tear - blocking traffic, leading 2,000 protestors in a Wall Street march. The court found the incredibly harsh rhetoric, speeches and demonstrations rendered an untainted jury impossible. The publicity-soaked N.Y.C. venue thus changed to Albany. Upstate. Tawana Brawley country. Sharpton and his band traveled up with it. Jurists concur this played a major role in the People of the State of New York vs. cops Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy. All four were acquitted.     </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK: Two New York police officers involved in the shooting death of an unarmed black man hours before he was due to marry have been charged with manslaughter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two were among five officers involved in the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, gunned down in a hail of bullets last year as he was leaving a nightclub in the borough of Queens in November. He was due to be married within hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two undercover detectives, Gescard Isnora, who is black, and Michael Oliver, who is white, were charged with intentional and reckless manslaughter and face up to 25 years in jail if convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The grand jury, as you know, concluded its deliberations last Friday ... It has handed up an eight-count indictment, which was sealed by law until this morning,'' Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Two of the officers charged ... have been charged with manslaughter in the first degree and in the second degree, that is to say both with intentional manslaughter and reckless manslaughter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third officer indicted over the shooting, detective Marc Cooper, was charged with reckless endangerment and faces one year in jail if convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three surrendered in New York yesterday and were due in court later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting triggered anger and protests in New York, amid allegations the incident reflected racism in the New York Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Isnora fired the first shot, but it is the firing of 31 shots by Officer Oliver -- an action that required him to reload his weapon -- that has angered many.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the months since the police shooting that left </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dead and his friends wounded outside a nightclub in Queens, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has kept up the measured, inclusionary tone that he struck from the beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As if using the actions of his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, as a reverse playbook, Mr. Bloomberg invited black leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, to City Hall, traveled to meet with Queens officials at least 10 times and praised Mr. Bell's family for expressing their outrage in a constructive manner. Yesterday, he defended his early assessment of the 50 shots fired as ''excessive force,'' displaying a rare willingness by a mayor to side against the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While those actions have won Mr. Bloomberg plaudits for soothing tempers, many community leaders say the mayor has not adequately addressed what they see as the underlying factors in the fatal mistake: overly aggressive tactics and racial profiling by the Police Department.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's been pretty much a clarion call from all around the city that encounters with the police are hostile,'' said City Councilman Leroy Comrie, who represents the area where Mr. Bell died. Saying that Mr. Bloomberg had not pushed the Police Department hard enough to make changes and acknowledge mistakes, he added: ''He's doing the outreach, he's doing the healing, but it's after the fact. He's patching the wound, but he's not doing the deep surgery required to keep the wound from reappearing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is some indication that the wound indeed runs deep. Both the number of police stop-and-frisks and the complaints about those stops are up sharply under Mr. Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From 2002 to 2006, complaints to the Civilian Complaint Review Board rose by 66 percent overall, while complaints about stop-and-frisks, increased by roughly three to four times. As has been the case for some time, black people filed complaints at a disproportionately high rate. Police Department statistics also show a fivefold increase in the number of stop-and-frisks last year from 2002, with more than half of them involving black residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City officials maintain that the race of those stopped and searched roughly parallels the race of people mentioned in reports from crime victims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most aggressive police tactics, fatal shootings, are generally down under Mr. Bloomberg, averaging 12 a year since 2002, down from an average of 25 a year during the 1990s. Still, in 2006, there were 13 fatal police shootings, up from 9 the year before, which was the lowest number since 1973, when there were 54.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the stop-and-frisk numbers contribute to the perception in many predominantly black neighborhoods that residents are being unfairly singled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''While it's certainly an aberration to be shot -- much less to be shot at 50 times -- the Bell shooting touches on something that is no aberration, which is the police being very aggressive with those in the black community,'' said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union and a frequent critic of the Police Department, in explaining why the response to the shooting had been so intense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such concerns have persisted in some quarters even though three of the five officers involved in Mr. Bell's shooting, and two of the three indicted for it, were black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To some extent, it is clear that the administration recognizes the problem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly acknowledged the perception that the police were overly aggressive in black neighborhoods and said it was something officials needed to continue to address, despite successful efforts to increase minority representation within the department. The department, he said, has gone from 65 percent white to 55 percent white in five years, and he has recently hired a new African liaison official and a new Muslim liaison official. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly, who attends several neighborhood meetings each week, said he was working to bolster efforts to explain how tactics like stop and frisks have helped drive down crime. At the same time, he said, the department has ''to take a look inward'' and improve training so that officers understand that stop-and-frisks, though lawful, can be intrusive and should be used ''more judiciously'' and ''perhaps with greater sensitivity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a question of how we do it and where,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Noting that many residents of predominantly black neighborhoods want a strong police presence even as they express discomfort with some police tactics, Mr. Kelly said, ''They want crime to go down, but they don't want to be stopped and they don't want their sons to be stopped, so it's a challenge.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The department has hired a private company to examine its stop-and-frisk practices as well as incidents of so-called contagious shooting, a phenomenon at work in both the death of Mr. Bell and of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African street vendor who died in a blizzard of 41 police bullets in 1999. Mr. Bloomberg, after examining the stop-and-frisk data from the Police Department and the Civilian Complaint Review Board, decided to increase its budget. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, Mr. Bloomberg has been on a listening tour of sorts, meeting and speaking with clergy members, elected officials and community leaders from across the city. Several of those leaders, meanwhile, have been formulating a response of their own, including a city, state and federal task force that plans to compile recommendations on policy and practices for the Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes, we mourn the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting; yes, we mourn for the police and their families because this affects them, too -- but what can we bring positive out of those two negative things?'' said State Senator Malcolm A. Smith of Queens, who helped organize the group, which plans to hold the second of five hearings this Friday at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm going to take this to a mathematical science,'' he added. ''You know two negatives equal a positive.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment of three police officers in the aftermath of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shooting is gratifying to some and troubling to others. Police officers must make instant decisions with fragmentary or imperfect knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slow and contentious procedure of criminal law is an imperfect way to determine the responsibility and degree of fault some police officers may have made in the Bell case. The 50 shots fired at Bell make people overreact, just as did the 41 bullets fired at Amadou Diallo on February 4, 1999. In the Diallo case, the Bronx County district attorney indicted the police officers for second-degree murder, the trial was moved to Albany County, and the four defendants were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Diallo case was factually simpler than the Bell case. Diallo was leaving his home in the Bronx when he was confronted by some police officers. Diallo reached for the identity papers in his pocket, as is done in his native Senegal, which was perceived as Diallo reaching for a gun by an officer. A fusillade by four policemen ensued. The Diallo case was awful, the Bell case, although equally tragic, is murkier. This is not a typical race case - two of the three defendants are black. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did drive a car into other vehicles and was said to have hit a policeman. He may have done this because he was fearful and in flight; that is an issue that will arise at the trial of the three indicted officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defense lawyers will try to move the case out of town, preferably upstate, where the case has not been so widely publicized, and where there may be many different jurors. The district attorney of Queens, Richard Brown, will oppose the change of venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge who will preside over the case, Justice Arthur Cooperman, who is 73 years old, was chosen to preside by random selection from a wheel containing the names of judges who volunteered their services. He will decide whether to grant the motion to change the venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal observers said that the indictment of the officers for murder in the Diallo case was overreaching because mistaken as the police obviously were, they could not be found beyond a reasonable doubt to have murdered Diallo without believing they had just cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The description of the white police officer in tears after no gun was found on Diallo indicates that the police did not shoot maliciously. Diallo would have been just as dead after one or two well-placed shots than 41 bullets, of which 22 missed him entirely. Although one shot would have been wrong, it was the multiplicity of bullets that made the case scandalous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reverend Al Sharpton tells us where he wants the trial to be held: &quot;The question of venue change is not only wrong but insulting the intelligence of the public and the intelligence of the court. We will not participate in or co-operate with a trial outside of Queens County.&quot; Mr. Sharpton's noncooperation is likely to have limited effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This case will dissuade some police officers from shooting too soon, but it should not dissuade anyone from shooting when necessary. There are psychotic and depraved people out there, who will kill others if they have the chance. About 600 people were murdered last year in New York City - the peak year was 1990, with 2,245 murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no best way to resolve such tragedies, but whatever the outcome in a particular case, in the long run, courts are probably the best places to find justice. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, they are the worst places to find justice, except for all the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Stern, president of New York Civic, was New York City's parks commissioner under Mayors Koch and Giuliani.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bloomberg is standing by his comment that the police used &quot;excessive force&quot; when they killed an unarmed man in Queens the night before his wedding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the fatal shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in November, Mr. Bloomberg said the 50 shots fired by police seemed &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;inexplicable.&quot; At the time, police and detective union officials said those types of comments could undermine the officers' chances of getting a fair hearing. On Monday, three of the five officers involved in the shooting were indicted. In the months since Bell's killing, Mr. Bloomberg has avoided using the same language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked yesterday whether he stood by his initial comments the mayor said, &quot;I just said I did.&quot; He added, &quot;I expressed my opinion as a layman, which I have a right to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the Detectives Endowment Association, Michael Palladino, said in an interview that Mr. Bloomberg's remarks &quot;certainly go a long way in poisoning a jury pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bloomberg said a change of venue for the trial is up to the District Attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the opinion of lawyers who represented the four cops acquitted in the killing of Amadou Diallo in a hail of 41 bullets in 1999.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts said that's partly because the system is inherently skewed against venue changes and also because the case will likely be heard months from now, during which time publicity about it will likely subside.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steven Brounstein, who represented Officer Kenneth Boss in Diallo's death, said, &quot;Right now, I think there's a lot of negative publicity. I'd ask for a change of venue right now.&quot; But asked if he thought he would be successful, he replied, &quot;I wouldn't bet on that one.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Patten, who represented Officer Sean Carroll in the shooting, agreed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts said getting a change of venue in the Bell case would be difficult also because it occurred in Queens, where such a motion is possible only after there has been an attempt to pick a jury.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Diallo shooting, in The Bronx, fell in a judicial district that allows change-of-venue motions to be made at any time. That trial was moved to Albany. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - As many as one in sixanimals died in tests of suspect dog andcat food by the manufacturer after complaints the products were poisoning pets around the country, the government said Monday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal investigation is focusing on wheat gluten as the likely source of contamination that sparked a recall last Friday of 60 million cans and pouches of the suspect food, said Stephen F. Sundlof, the Food and Drug Administration's top veterinarian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ingredient, a protein source, is commonly used as filler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agency investigators are looking at other ingredients as well. The wet-style pet food was made by Menu Foods, an Ontario, Canada-based company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menu Foods told the FDA it received the first complaints of kidney failure and deaths among cats and dogs from pet owners on Feb. 20. It began new tests on Feb. 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During those tests, the company fed its product to 40 to 50 dogs and cats and seven animals - the mix of species was not immediately known - died, Dr. Sundlof said. The contamination appeared more deadly to cats than to dogs, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) -- Three police officers charged in a 50-shot barrage that killed an unarmed bridegroom on his wedding day had their first encounter since the shooting with the victims and their families Monday in a packed courtroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three officers, who fired 46 of the 50 shots, stood staunchly, hands clasped, throughout the 20-minute hearing as they pleaded not guilty in the shooting that killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded two of his friends. The judge set bail for the two officers who fired the most shots and released the other without bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shooting victims Joseph Guzman, in a wheelchair, and Trent Benefield, using a crutch, attended with Nicole Paultre Bell, who was engaged to Bell and legally took his name after he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown on Monday unsealed the indictment charging Detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 times, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detectives would face mandatory prison time -- up to 25 years -- if they are convicted of the top charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver also was charged with endangerment for a bullet that smashed through the window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third officer, Detective Marc Cooper, was charged with a misdemeanor in the case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driver in two crashes, one fatal, is sentenced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHITE PLAINS (AP) -- A young man who killed one friend and hurt another in two car crashes while driving impaired was sentenced Monday to one to three years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralph Tarchine III, 19, of Bedford, had pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter and driving while impaired in a December crash and vehicular assault and driving while intoxicated in a January crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Plunkett, 17, of Ridgefield, Conn., was killed in the first accident. While that was being investigated, Tarchine and a passenger were seriously injured in the second crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there was anything I could do to bring Mike back, I would do it, even if it meant dying myself,&quot; Tarchine told acting State Supreme Court Justice Richard Molea before being sentenced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His parents wept in the gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tarchine had nearly escaped with a plea deal that would have sentenced him to just six months in the county jail and probation. But the deal outraged the victims' families, and the judge threw it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave Tarchine the chance to withdraw his guilty plea and go to trial, but Tarchine decided to accept a prison sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US: Two New York policemen were charged with manslaughter and a third with reckless endangerment yesterday in the firing of 50 shots at three unarmed black men that killed a groom on his wedding day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers were cleared in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Se&aacute;n Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (23), which prompted allegations of brutality and racial profiling by police and led to street protests and activists' demands for murder indictments for all five officers involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury from the New York borough of Queens reached the indictments on Friday. The detectives turned themselves in yesterday morning before the charges were unsealed and announced by Queens district attorney Richard Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two - a black and a Hispanic - face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter. The third, who is black, faces one year if convicted of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury's decisions angered some activists, who had hoped for murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five police officers fired 50 shots at Mr Bell's car at around 4am on November 25th in the mistaken belief that someone had gone to fetch a gun to settle a dispute inside a strip club, where the three had attended Mr Bell's bachelor party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bell, who was to marry the mother of his two children that day, died in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a travesty of justice. All five should have been indicted for murder,&quot; city councillor Charles Barron, who has led street protests, said outside the courtroom. &quot;It's a set-up for a slap on the wrist. We are going to keep the heat on the street because this is wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brown said he would oppose any attempt to move the trial, an option the defence could request if it believes potential jurors were biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a case where public opinion is perhaps equally divided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my judgment it is a case that should be tried before the people of Queens County and the jury should be representative of the diversity of our county,&quot; Mr Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes of venue have been controversial, as in the 1999 killing of unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo, who was shot at 41 times by four New York police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those officers were acquitted of murder in 2000 after the trial was moved outside the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting and verdict sparked big demonstrations in protest at police brutality and racial profiling that resulted in hundreds of arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1991 Los Angeles police beating of black motorist Rodney King, a venue change led to days of violent rioting when the white officers were acquitted in an affluent suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York had put 1,700 officers on alert in anticipation of the announcement of the grand jury's decision. &quot;Heaven help us all if our call for justice is not answered,&quot; said city councillor James Sanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's conceivable that we will have a Los Angeles-type rising.&quot; Police commissioner Raymond Kelly vowed that the police department would &quot;redouble its efforts to build the best possible relations with all of New York City's diverse communities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two indicted for manslaughter were Gescard Isnora, an undercover detective accused of firing the first shot and 11 in all, and Det Mike Oliver, accused of firing 31 shots by emptying his gun, reloading, and emptying it again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Det Marc Cooper, who fired four times, was charged with reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three US police officers yesterday surrendered to face charges in the New York shooting that killed a groom on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policemen, accused of firing most of the 50 shots at three young men in a car outside a nightclub, were being fingerprinted and processed yesterday morning before their arraignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, who fired 11 bullets, face felony manslaughter charges, a source close to the investigation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanour endangerment charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grand jurors declined to indict on the more serious counts of second-degree murder and attempted murder, or the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers involved in the shooting were not indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a long way from a conviction,&quot; defence lawyer Philip Karasyk, who represents Mr Isnora, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors have declined to discuss the grand jury's work until the findings are officially released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The November 25 shooting killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and severely injured two of his bachelor party guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has renewed allegations that the New York Police Department is too fast on the trigger and sparked protests by activists who say the department is racial profiling, a claim city officials deny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men who were shot were black. Mr Cooper (39) and Isnora (28), are also black; Oliver (35), is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two officers - one black and one white - were not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While relatives of the victims waited for the Queens district attorney to unseal the indictment yesterday, some were angry about reports of a lavish weekend party involving one of the indicted men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Oliver ran up a $4,200 (&pound;2,100) bill at a restaurant with supporters feasting on $180 (&pound;90) pasta with truffles and $575 (&pound;290) bottles of wine, the Daily News reported yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't really know what he was celebrating,&quot; Denise Ford, whose son Trent Benefield was shot and seriously wounded the night Bell was killed, said. A third friend, Joseph Guzman, was also wounded in the shooting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Auberry vanished in the heavily wooded terrain after lunch Saturday with the other Scouts and troop leaders. Searchers found his mess kit late Saturday within a mile of the camp site but no other sign of him, authorities said. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Three police officers charged in a 50-bullet barrage that killed an unarmed groom on his wedding day appeared before a judge Monday and had their first encounter since the shooting with the victims and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a packed, tension-filled courtroom, the three officers stood with their hands clasped during the 20-minute hearing as they pleaded not guilty in the shooting that killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded two of his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers fired 46 of the 50 shots. The judge set bail for the two officers who fired the most bullets and released the other without bail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. - A soldier accused of ordering subordinates to kill three Iraqi detainees should be sentenced to 10 years in prison, a military jury said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff Sgt. Ray Girouard, who was found guilty Friday of negligent homicide in his court-martial, could have received up to 21 years in prison. He avoided a life sentence when he was found not guilty of premeditated murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military panel also recommended a reduction in his rank, a dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay, with a recommendation that the money go to his wife and 4-year-old son.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Lifting the ban on taxpayer funding of research on new stem cells from fertilized embryos would better serve both science and the nation, the chief of the National Institutes of Health told lawmakers Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allowing the ban to remain in place, Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni told a Senate panel, leaves his agency fighting &quot;with one hand tied behind our back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOLLYWOOD, Fla. - Police cited Broward Circuit Judge Lawrence Korda - one of two who made decisions recently in the Anna Nicole Smith case - for smoking marijuana in a park Sunday afternoon, a police spokesman said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three on-duty officers who were doing physical training in Stanley Goldman Park caught the judge about 2 p.m., said Capt. Tony Rode. The judge was smoking a joint near a tree in the park, which is near Interstate 95.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the justices conclude Joseph Frederick's homemade sign was a pro-drug message, they are likely to side with principal Deborah Morse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transcript released Monday was the fourth from the hearings the military is holding in private for 14 ''high-value'' terror suspects who were kept in secret CIA prisons before they were sent to the U.S. facility in Cuba last fall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight-count indictment charges detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 shots, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanor endangerment charge, Brown said. The indictment says he fired a bullet that went through the window of an occupied train station.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The approvals, which had been expected, were announced Monday after world powers agreed in principle to a new package of sanctions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's worst-kept secret was officially revealed yesterday with the unsealing of indictments against three police detectives in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thanks to information leaks, the mother's milk of journalists and government officials, the outlines of the indictments became known within minutes after a Queens grand jury handed them up on Friday: manslaughter charges against Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard F. Isnora, and charges of reckless endangerment against Detective Marc Cooper. In that sense, yesterday's announcement of the charges by the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, was merely a formality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no such thing as a mere formality when police officers stand accused, especially when their actions caused the death of an unarmed man, Mr. Bell. Especially when that unarmed man lost his life in a barrage of 50 bullets. Especially when that unarmed man lost his life in a barrage of 50 bullets on what should have been his wedding day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So there was inherent drama yesterday, even if Mr. Brown read the indictments with about as much emotion as he might have summoned while reciting a passage from Thucydides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he spoke, thoughts drifted back to Amadou Diallo, the African immigrant gunned down in the Bronx in 1999 by four police officers firing 41 shots. The contrasts between the two situations were almost palpable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Bell case, Mr. Brown was no-nonsense; he made the charges public on the first possible working day. In the Diallo case, the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, kept an anxious city dangling for six days; he held onto a sealed indictment against the four officers until Mr. Diallo's parents could fly in from overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alongside Mr. Brown yesterday stood a dozen of his prosecutors and investigators. Alongside Mr. Johnson in 1999 stood the Diallo parents. But the Diallos, with all respect for their pain, had no standing in the matter. Having them there was purely an emotional fillip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most significant difference, though, lay in the charges. At the behest of Mr. Johnson, who likened the Diallo killing to a drive-by shooting, the grand jury returned charges of second-degree murder. The Bell grand jury settled for a top charge of first-degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sure, it is a serious accusation. It carries a possible prison sentence of 25 years. But it falls well short of suggesting that the detectives showed depraved indifference to human life, let alone that they consciously set out to kill Mr. Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Predictably, protesters gathered outside the Queens courthouse where the officers were arraigned yesterday. Predictably, they denounced the manslaughter charges as woefully insufficient. Predictably, they demanded murder indictments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Manslaughter is not good enough because we've seen people walk on that,'' said Hazel N. Dukes, president of the New York State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. Branches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Charles Barron, the former Black Panther turned city councilman, felt the same. ''They're setting it up for an acquittal or a slap on the wrist,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  History, however, suggests that the opposite is true. Indict a New York police officer for murder in the performance of his job, however much he may have botched it, and you are almost guaranteeing he will walk. That was a lesson from the Diallo case, which ended with all four officers being acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aiming low is sometimes a more effective tactic for a prosecutor. Lying low is definitely a more effective tactic for police officers accused of serious crimes. On that score, we have another contrast between the two cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Diallo officers all but vanished before their trial. That by itself may not have helped their cause. But it surely did not hurt it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Compare them with Detective Oliver, who may have the most explaining to do in the Bell case, having fired 31 of the 50 shots. On Sunday, an article and a photograph on the front page of The New York Post showed him in the company of two women, leaving a high-priced East Side restaurant where a friend had reportedly picked up an astounding $4,200 dinner tab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Is any of this relevant to the case? Not really. But since when is life always about relevance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you're under indictment in a high-profile case, do you really want a prospective juror to wonder how it is that you're feasting on $65 Dover sole while he is sitting at some lunch counter nibbling on a grilled-cheese sandwich?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By pursuing first-degree manslaughter charges against two detectives in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prosecutors in Queens were probably influenced by what happened in the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, criminal law experts said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The four officers indicted eight years ago in the death of Mr. Diallo, an unarmed West African who was killed in a fusillade of 41 police bullets, were acquitted after having been charged with second-degree murder. Critics said at the time that the Bronx prosecutors sought overly steep charges in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said yesterday that the Diallo case had not affected the way his office had prepared the indictment, but experts disagreed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The manslaughter charges filed yesterday against Detectives Gescard F. Isnora and Michael Oliver may be easier to pursue, since prosecutors will not have to prove that the officers intended to kill Mr. Bell, who was fatally shot in his car. Instead, they may only have to prove that the officers intended to harm someone with him in the car, and that he died as a result. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many defense lawyers said yesterday, however, that even the manslaughter charges might be too high a hurdle to clear, given the long history of difficulties prosecutors have had in winning convictions in police violence cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It had been widely predicted that the highest charges the two detectives would face would be second-degree manslaughter or reckless endangerment; the latter is a lesser charge with a far more lenient minimum sentence and is easier to prove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Implicit in the charge of first-degree manslaughter is the element of intent, something that has been exceedingly hard for prosecutors to convince jurors of in previous police-involved shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The police officer is doing his job, he's out there, he's in plainclothes, he sees something that appears to be criminal in nature,'' said Ronald P. Fischetti, a criminal defense lawyer. ''So he intended to fire, of course. But the question is: Was there wrongfulness in the intent?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If officers believe they or someone else is in imminent danger, their use of deadly force is justified under the law. By charging two of the detectives with first-degree manslaughter, the grand jurors clearly reviewed the question of whether the detectives could have reasonably believed they were facing imminent threats when they fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the jury had thought they were justified in firing, ''they would not have indicted them,'' said Paul G. Chevigny, a professor of criminal law at New York University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detectives also face an array of other charges, including second-degree manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment, and as a result, a trial jury will have a variety of options. If jurors decide that the two detectives did not act with criminal intent, they may agree with prosecutors that they acted recklessly in firing so many shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, Detective Oliver is accused of reloading -- taking the time to pull out one clip and reload -- and firing 31 shots in all. Detective Isnora fired 11 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A third detective, Marc Cooper, was charged only with two counts of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor, one of the counts stemming from a shot that hit a nearby AirTrain station. Detectives Oliver and Isnora were also charged with reckless endangerment, as well as first-degree assault charges in the shooting of Mr. Bell's friends, Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, who both survived with serious injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You're talking about police officers that have but a split second to make a decision whether to use reasonable force,'' said Joseph Tacopina, a criminal defense lawyer and former assistant district attorney in Brooklyn. ''We all understand what is careless and reckless. But for a police officer it's a different equation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legal experts had predicted that Detectives Isnora and Oliver were most vulnerable to criminal charges. Several of the officers who fired later in the fusillade could argue, they reasoned, that they had believed they were being fired on. But Detective Isnora fired the first shot, and Detective Oliver, by reloading, may have caused prosecutors to question whether it was reasonable for him to perceive a threat across the entire time it took to fire 31 shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora is likely to argue, experts said, that he cannot be guilty of manslaughter since none of his bullets actually struck Mr. Bell. Prosecutors appear to contend that he is culpable nonetheless since his shot started the gunfire that killed Mr. Bell. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By letting the detectives testify without immunity before the grand jury, their lawyers also departed from the defense strategy in the Diallo case, in which the officers did not testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The defense attorneys took some gambles by putting their guys in,'' Mr. Fischetti said. ''And now they're stuck with their testimony. The district attorney knows exactly what their theory is, what they said, what they heard, and why they fired.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reports of Detective Oliver enjoying a lavish $4,200 meal with friends on Madison Avenue after his indictment could also hurt his case, if trial jurors view it as an insensitive extravagance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now that the indictment has been handed up, it seems certain that the defense lawyers will push for a change of venue, arguing that prospective jurors have been biased by intense news media coverage. Some experts said it was doubtful that a judge would grant the change, given the uproar after the officers were acquitted in the Diallo trial, which was moved to Albany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond reading the charges at a news conference, Mr. Brown, the Queens district attorney, declined to elaborate on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The interests of a fair and balanced prosecution prevent me from providing you with more information than I have already provided,'' he said. ''It deserves repeating that a grand jury does not decide whether a person has been proven guilty. That is a trial jury's job.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three detectives left their homes in the predawn darkness yesterday. They walked in the back entrance of the courthouse in Queens to Central Booking, where they went through a routine that must have seemed familiar: fingerprints, waiting, mug shots, more waiting, paperwork, more waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three men had logged hundreds of arrests. But this time, they were turning themselves in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three pleaded not guilty to numerous charges -- including, for two of them, first- and second-degree manslaughter -- in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a 23-year-old black man who fell in a volley of police gunfire as he was leaving a Queens nightclub early on Nov. 25, the morning of his scheduled wedding. Mr. Bell and his two friends were unarmed, though the officers apparently believed there was a gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case has reopened wounds in a city where both crime and racial strife seemed to have abated.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday's proceedings, with the unsealing of an eight-count indictment, brought the case into a very public phase. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In court, the three detectives stood with their shoulders squared, facing the judge. In a wheelchair behind them, staring at their backs, was Joseph Guzman, who was shot multiple times in the barrage. ''R.I.P. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' read his hooded sweatshirt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Today we got an indictment -- Round 1,'' said Mr. Guzman, who rose from his wheelchair to speak with reporters after the arraignment. ''We got a hard road to go. We lost somebody dear. We're going to fight all the way until we get justice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Five police officers had fired into the car carrying Mr. Bell, Mr. Guzman and a third man, Trent Benefield, during a chaotic confrontation outside Club Kalua on Liverpool Street in Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most serious charges are against Detective Michael Oliver, who fired 31 shots, and Detective Gescard F. Isnora, who fired 11 times. Both face counts of first- and second-degree manslaughter and second-degree reckless endangerment. Detective Oliver, 35, also faces charges of first-degree assault and second-degree endangerment; Detective Isnora, 28, faces a charge of second-degree assault. Those charges could bring a maximum sentence of 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Marc Cooper, 39, who fired four times, faces two charges of reckless endangerment, misdemeanors that carry a maximum sentence of one year. The two other officers were not indicted. Detectives Isnora and Cooper are black; Detective Oliver is white. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg urged New Yorkers to ''respect the result of our justice system.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bloomberg added: ''It also needs to be said that being a police officer, as we were reminded several times last week, is a very dangerous job. And although a trial will decide whether crimes were committed in this case, day in and day out the N.Y.P.D. does an incredible job under very difficult circumstances.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three detectives arrived at the courthouse in Kew Gardens at 7 a.m., then spent much of the next six hours in a stuffy room in Central Booking, where they sat for mug shots and fingerprints. James Culleton, a lawyer for Detective Oliver, called it ''a slow day, a slow process, but it's usually what happens when you surrender a client.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Culleton said Detective Oliver was ''very nervous.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He was very upset; these are very serious charges,'' Mr. Culleton said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The wait was a somber one, said Philip E. Karasyk, who represents Detective Isnora. ''There is nothing more heart-wrenching than to a see a police officer put through the system, especially one who didn't do anything wrong,'' Mr. Karasyk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time the three detectives entered the courtroom about 2:30 p.m., every seat was taken. On the left side of the courtroom were supporters of the officers: their families, union officials and rows of men wearing detective badges pinned to dark business suits. On the right were relatives of Mr. Bell, several holding children, wearing buttons with his photograph. One of them, George Taggart, had fixed his gaze across the courtroom, toward the door where the officers would enter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We'll get a chance to see them up close and personal,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last to file in was a caravan of a dozen people led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Behind him was Nicole Paultre Bell, Mr. Bell's fiancee, wearing a black suit, her hair sleek and bobbed. Mr. Benefield was behind her, walking with a crutch. Mr. Guzman's wheelchair was on the aisle. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, Justice Randall T. Eng entered the courtroom, and asked that the defendants be brought forward. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawyers for all three police officers entered their not guilty pleas to each count. As they spoke, Valerie Bell, Mr. Bell's mother, covered her face with her hands. Justice Eng set bail at $250,000 bond, or $100,000 cash, for Detectives Isnora and Oliver; their lawyers said they would post it. Detective Cooper's lawyer, Paul P. Martin, asked that his client be released on his own recognizance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is the father of three, and his wife and children are in the audience,'' he said. Justice Eng agreed, and adjourned the case until April 11. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All three officers filed out through a side door, 23 minutes after they had entered. About a half-hour later, they climbed into a line of vehicles and were whisked away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside, the weather had turned colder, and Mrs. Bell held her handbag tightly. She read to reporters from a piece of notebook paper covered with handwriting. ''I miss him desperately,'' she said of her son. ''Countless times I tried to bring forth my own understanding only to be humbled by the weight of my own thoughts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She added, ''This is truly one of the most devastating and challenging times of our lives.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Paultre Bell emerged, too, and spoke two quiet sentences. ''Today was just a baby step in this long road we have ahead of us,'' she said. ''We are here to fight, and we're going to continue to pray for justice.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Police Department will now undertake its own investigation of the officers who were not indicted, including formal interviews with the officers and a Firearms Discharge Review Board, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday. He said the police could not investigate until the prosecutor had decided whether criminal charges were warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly said that Detectives Isnora, Cooper and Oliver had been suspended without pay, and the two officers who were not indicted -- Officer Michael Carey and Detective Paul Headley -- had been placed on modified assignment, as was Lt. Gary Napoli, who was leading the team on Nov. 25. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said at a news conference early in the day that the grand jury proceedings were ''as thorough and complete as I've ever participated in.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His office's investigation, he said, drew in 100 witnesses and 500 separate exhibits. He said the grand jury ''acted in the most responsible and conscientious fashion,'' and noted that he could not recall a grand jury that deliberated for three days on a case, as this one did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This was a case that was, I'm sure, not easy for them to resolve,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sharpton, who met with Mr. Brown for an hour after the arraignment, told reporters afterward that he hoped to see ''an aggressive prosecution, with no plea-bargaining or harassment of witnesses.'' He said the two surviving victims, Mr. Benefield and Mr. Guzman, would not cooperate with the authorities if the trial was moved to another venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is no victory here,'' Mr. Sharpton said of the arraignment. ''But we hope we can get justice. Now it's time for at least these three to pay for what they did on Nov. 25, 2006.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael Palladino, the president of the Detectives Endowment Association, said defense lawyers might move for a change of venue, but had not made a decision. ''Once we put a full legal team together we'll definitely research that issue,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a news conference after the proceedings, he said the manslaughter charges implied that the officers intended to kill Mr. Bell, which he called ''a chilling message to all of law enforcement.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a dark day for our detectives and the N.Y.P.D.,'' he said. ''However, I think it is a good day in that we can finally get involved in the process. Our defense begins today.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At 4 p.m., the detectives were gone and the courthouse had mostly emptied. Mr. Bell's family marched west, in a group of about two dozen, down Queens Boulevard. The police removed the barricades in front of the courthouse, and the last demonstrators packed up and went home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Behind them, a handmade sign fluttered on a tree. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Detective Cooper,'' it read. ''You took a father and a husband.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps a bit of history may help put things in perspective.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'd been in Officer Volpe's position more than once; I understood that sometimes you lose control. Sometimes there is too much anger, too much fear. I've said it -- shouted it, ''If you don't back up and calm down, I'm going to take this stick and '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You had to be there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A street, an entire neighborhood, gone insane, a world of hostility and savagery, the threats of violence everywhere, the night exploding with bottles and bricks, and I was going through emotions probably similar to what Custer felt at the Little Big Horn. ''Back up,'' I hear myself shouting. ''If you don't, I'll take this stick '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No, I never did it. But I certainly could understand the threat, if not the reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I knew Justin Volpe's father, Robert Volpe. We were detectives together in the narcotics bureau. A kind man, a fine painter with showings in New York City galleries. There was not an ounce of narrow-mindedness in Bob Volpe -- he was a man totally incapable of passing on racism to his son. And the son, Justin, was engaged to a black woman at the time of the Louima case. I defended Justin in radio and TV interviews -- it couldn't have happened, it was unbelievable, beyond belief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As it turned out I was wrong; in a moment of madness Justin Volpe lost himself to a psychotic impulse and he was irretrievably gone. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Now a man can crack in many ways; Bob Volpe, after visiting his convict son, died of a heart attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tragic, horrible -- but an aberration? Hardly. Such things are rooted in the human realities of police work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two years later, in early February 1999, a team of plainclothes police officers were patrolling in the Bronx looking for an armed serial rapist. An African immigrant, Amadou Diallo, fit the description. Spotted by the officers, he scooted into a dimly lighted vestibule. There was a surreptitious move in the dark hallway -- Mr. Diallo was going for his wallet, or cellphone, nobody knows. From behind came a shout: ''Gun -- look out, he's got a gun.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officer Edward McMellon was in point-blank range. He fired three times, stepped backward, stumbled and fell, fracturing his tailbone. Seeing their colleague go down, thinking he'd been shot, the other officers opened fire. It was an unmitigated tragic mistake -- the police in a matter of seconds fired 41 shots, 19 of which found their mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Assassins they were not. Mindless executioners -- of course not. When they realized what had happened, in the dark of that hallway, two or three sat on the curb, crying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, this makes little difference to those like Al Sharpton who have made careers out of demonizing the police. Whenever something like this happens, the professional police haters will hold their rallies at 1 Police Plaza, people will come with signs comparing the department to the Ku Klux Klan. The signs are sometimes clever but always mean-spirited and reflecting a calculated rage; any thinking person knows that they are self-serving nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Someone once said that a society that makes unwarranted war with its police had better make friends with its criminals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and I went to the same high school, pitched for the same high-school baseball team -- 50 years apart. I look at his picture, a handsome young man with a beautiful fiancee and an adorable child. Tragic, horrible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here is what we know. Club Kalua is a topless bar in Jamaica, Queens -- a hotbed of narcotics, prostitution, gun sales and under-age drinking. It was the early morning of Nov. 28, that time of night when police officers know that ''sporting life'' people are out and about. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the club, an undercover detective overheard that Joseph Guzman, a member of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> party, had a gun and was about to use it. Nothing new for Mr. Guzman; he'd been convicted in an armed robbery during which the victim was shot at. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the street, the undercover officer walked over to where Mr. Guzman, Mr. Bell and two others sat in Mr. Bell's car. The officer was wearing his shield on a chain around his neck. He identified himself, saying, ''Let me see your hands.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Using the car as a 3,000-pound weapon, Mr. Bell hit the accelerator, clipped the undercover officer and then, according to witnesses, twice tried to run the officer down. Then the car slammed into an unmarked police van. At some point, the officer fired his weapon. The other officers, believing they were under attack, also fired their guns, eventually unloading 50 rounds and killing Mr. Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You had to be there, but ask yourself, what would you have done? Certainly there were mistakes made, terrible life-threatening mistakes. But it was the occupants of that car who made them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of these officers now indicted had never fired his gun before, despite having made more than 600 arrests. This is no fool, no trigger-happy John Wayne type; this is a good cop. (It's also worth noting that we are hearing the usual cries of police racism, even though two of the indicted officers are black.) Empirical data will show you that the Police Department is more cautious with the use of force now than at any time in its history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There will always be some who want to believe what Mr. Sharpton says, even though they know better. For some reason, they feel an obligation to raise their voices in anger, to march outside 1 Police Plaza in response to events that they -- or anyone who wasn't present outside Club Kalua -- know little about. It's a contradiction, a puzzle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In practically every police shooting there are two views: the way it looks and the way it really is. Still, one fact will always remain -- shootings are always tragic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now we will have the trials the police critics have been calling for. I hope but have little faith that they will stop the angry rhetoric and let the juries make their decisions in peace. As for those three men, they can take solace from an ancient cop saying: ''I'll always rather be judged by 12 of my fellow citizens than carried by six of my brother officers.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent resignation of the NAACP's president, Bruce Gordon, is the product of political imperatives stemming from the Democratic takeover of Congress last year, but his departure also has roots in a century-old quarrel about the strategy of the civil rights struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gordon, a former Verizon executive, was hired in June 2005 as the organization sought traction in the Republican-dominated capital and hoped to fend off a federal tax investigation. He resigned last month, citing differences with the NAACP's 64-member board, but observers say one factor in his demise was that his corporate sensibilities proved to be less of an asset after Democrats won control of the House and Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't put Gordon in there to make nice to Charlie Rangel,&quot; a political analyst at a Washington think tank, the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, David Bositis, said. &quot;Why suck up to Republicans when they're clearly on the defense?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2006, Mr. Gordon persuaded President Bush to speak to the group's annual convention for the first time in his presidency. To outsiders, that may have seemed like a shrewd move for both Mr. Bush and the group, but the president's appearance there hurt Mr. Gordon with the organization's local activists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They resented that, quite frankly,&quot; a former NAACP official, Michael Meyers, said. &quot;They don't cotton to Republicans. This alienated the base, the rank-and-file church ladies with the big hats. If you offend them or ignore them, you're in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rift was exacerbated as Mr. Gordon sought to expand the NAACP's involvement with financial literacy programs, Medicare Part D enrollment, and other social services the organization has traditionally left to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We make it possible for social justice programs to be done. We should not be the organization doing it,&quot; a veteran NAACP organizer in California, Alice Huffman, told KQED-FM in a recent interview. &quot;We shouldn't take government money. ? We have to be very careful. You cannot bite the hand that feeds you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quarrel evokes a long-standing divide among black activists that stretches back at least a century, to the time when a moderate promoting self-help, Booker Washington, clashed with one of the founders of the NAACP, W.E.B. Du Bois, who favored political action and protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Huffman and others argue that the focus of the NAACP should be, as it was at the outset, squarely on ferreting out racism. However, others in the community have questioned whether that focus still makes sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not going to change racism. The NAACP is still fighting that old ghost. He's there and he's always going to be there. What you need to do is find ways to do things that pull us up from the inside,&quot; an African-American columnist at the St. Petersburg Times in Florida, Bill Maxwell, said in an interview. &quot;My unpainted, dilapidated house doesn't have anything to do with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Maxwell said Mr. Gordon was trying to move the NAACP more in the direction of self-help, but the group's leaders rejected that. &quot;He was trying to change the direction of a battleship. ? His approach was incremental,&quot; the columnist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. Maxwell said any African-American calling for more individual and community responsibility is immediately viewed as a tool of white racists. That's not entirely off the mark, as he found out when he recently wrote a column calling for the NAACP to promote more inward focus to advancement. He scored an invite to the organization's local chapter, but also an unwelcome embrace from other readers. &quot;The rednecks down here are thrilled,&quot; the columnist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates of a more traditional civil rights advocacy role for the NAACP say there are enough signs of flagrant racism that the group would be foolish to abandon its unique devotion to that issue. Just last month, a mainstream Asian-American newspaper, AsianWeek, published a column titled &quot;Why I Hate Blacks.&quot; Others see strong evidence of race-based police brutality in such incidents as the flurry of police bullets that killed an African-American man, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, on his wedding day last November in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NAACP with its resources nationally can really take a bite out of police misconduct,&quot; Mr. Meyers, who heads the New York Civil Rights Coalition, said. He said he would like to see the group focused on housing discrimination, prisons, and greater accountability in schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Meyers said the NAACP's drift toward direct social services under Mr. Gordon was driven in part by corporate donors who were not interested in supporting political and social activism, but willing to fund giveaway programs and financial seminars. &quot;That's not the role for the NAACP, though a lot of people in corporate America think that should be the primary focus of a civil rights organization,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NAACP's chairman, Julian Bond, did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Mr. Gordon could not be reached. However, in a memo to the NAACP's board, Mr. Gordon attributed his departure primarily to issues of governance. &quot;I did not accept this position to follow orders,&quot; he wrote in the memo, which was posted by an African-American-oriented Web site, Afro-Netizen.com, and confirmed as authentic by people close to the organization. He mentioned tensions over meetings with Mr. Bush and other top administration officials, as well as disagreements about whether certain &quot;service&quot; activities were compatible with the NAACP's role as an advocacy organization.In a written statement posted on the group's Web site, Mr. Bond offered something of a rebuttal. &quot;The board sets policy and the CEO is obliged to implement it,&quot; he said. Mr. Bond also spoke of a &quot;return to fundamentals&quot; at the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several observers credited Mr. Gordon with bringing honesty to the NAACP's membership tallies and then working to boost them. The group had boasted for decades that it had half a million members, even as its numbers were dwindling. Mr. Gordon acknowledged that the number was about 250,000 and set about building the rolls to about 400,000, according to recent figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, one of the group's most daunting challenges is a demographic one. The rank-and-file members that Mr. Meyers refers to as &quot;the church ladies with the big hats&quot; are aging and, to be blunt, dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Half of the African-American population is younger than 32,&quot; Mr. Bositis noted. While the NAACP has tried some outreach to the &quot;hip-hop&quot; generation, those efforts have fallen flat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like going to an AARP convention,&quot; Mr. Maxwell said of the NAACP's annual convention. &quot;If they don't learn to attract some young blood, some young people, they're gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE sign in neat large letters yesterday read: &quot;Detective Oliver 31 shots is murder.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councilman Charles Barron - a very articulate but bitter man who once said: &quot;I sometimes wanna go up to some white guy and slap him in the face and say, 'This is a black thing,' &quot; - stood nearby.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not manslaughter,&quot; Barron said outside the Queens courthouse. &quot;This is a set-up so they will get an acquittal. This is murder.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To listen to Barron, you'd think the five cops, white and black, under indictment in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case called up each other in the morning and said, &quot;Let's go to this sleazy bar in Jamaica and kill some bad guys.&quot; Community activist Theodora X. Kenney said: &quot;This was murder . . . We advocate violence against those who treat us violently.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, you nitwits, this was not murder. It was a tragedy of gargantuan proportions. No mother, particularly the mother of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can accept that, and all our hearts go out to her.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Michael Oliver perceived, and I emphasize the word perceived, that he and his comrades were under deadly fire. And in any cop's handbook, you know that under fire, you return all the fire until deadly force is removed.    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's car &quot;was still moving as shots were fired, and it struck an undercover officer twice,&quot; said Mike Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a bad message to all detectives, all cops. You fire once, twice, you won't get indicted. But you respond [with more bullets], and you are looking at 25 years in jail.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's always been the case that you don't shoot - and there are six pallbearers at your funeral. You do shoot - and you go to jail. What's the sense?     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me add: I never saw Charlie Barron or, for that matter, that woman called Theodora, and certainly not much of Al Sharpton, when white cop Pat Rafferty and Officer Bobby Parker, a very popular black cop, were shot down in 2004. Neither drew their guns.     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palladino said the good news yesterday was the chance now to try the Bell case in a court of law. Until now, he said, &quot;it has been tried by public opinion and activists. Now we'll have a chance to present our side . . . But in the meantime, it's been a bad message to cops.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right on, Mike. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three of New York's Finest were arraigned yesterday on felony and lesser charges in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case - a tragedy steeped in the chaos and danger that city cops face daily. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three - Detectives Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper - pleaded not guilty to the eight counts against them. Oliver and Isnora face charges of manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment; Cooper is accused of reckless endangerment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it's up to Queens DA Richard Brown to prove those charges.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'll have his hands full. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, the usual racial troublemakers already have convicted the three - and locked them up for good. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if life were so simple. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night in question, Bell and his pals were celebrating his upcoming wedding at the Kalua Cabaret, a skeevy strip joint known for drugs, prostitution and guns. The cops were there gathering evidence in an effort to shut the dump down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Bell and his buddies left, chaos erupted. Bell rammed his car into a police van and clipped Isnora, who was the first to fire his weapon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it was over, five officers had fired 50 shots; Bell was dead, his pals seriously injured. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DA Brown's extraordinarily thorough investigation followed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As did the indictments. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now comes the trial, with time out for motions and a probable application for a change of venue - a not-unreasonable request under the circumstances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to keep this in the street,&quot; the Rev. Al Sharpton vowed last November - and, as always, he hasn't disappointed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Sharpton and his ilk weren't the only ones in the streets of late. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take some of the incidents that city cops faced last week: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Crowds at a high-school basketball championship game at Madison Square Garden began a near-riot Sunday night, stretching all the way from 33rd Street to 42nd and Times Square. Gunfire erupted. Cops on horseback were called in. The Deuce had to be shut down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On Tuesday, gunman Corey Mickins shot plainclothes officer Robert Tejada twice in a Harlem restaurant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Later that night, police say Hugo Hernandez stabbed transit officer Angel Cruz in the head with a hunting knife during a life-or-death struggle at a Brooklyn subway station. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On Wednesday night, two unarmed auxiliarly cops were executed in cold blood by a deranged ex-Marine who had just murdered a bartender in Greenwich Village. Police managed to kill the gunman, David Garvin, after a total of 56 shots were fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For sure, New York today isn't the seething cauldron Rudy Giuliani inherited 13 years ago, and Mayor Bloomberg deserves considerable applause for consolidating the gains of his predecessor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the bulk of the credit goes to the men and women of the NYPD, who are on the streets in the wee hours, at places just like the Kalua Cabaret - risking their lives, and futures - for the citizens of New York City. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are not perfect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They make mistakes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But imagine what the city would be like without them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the charges leveled yesterday require that intent to do harm be proved beyond a reasonable doubt if a conviction is to be obtained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, perhaps more relevant to this case, to be sustained on appeal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact is, sometimes police officers must fire their guns. And when that happens, the consequences can be tragic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But criminalizing tragic outcomes serves only to embolden criminals and to hamstring the police. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to propel New York City back toward the abyss. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two cops who fired 42 of 50 shots at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could face more than half a century behind bars after their indictment yesterday in the death of the unarmed groom.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third could escape prison entirely.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYPD Detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, who got off 11 bullets, pleaded not guilty to a slew of charges, including first- and second-degree manslaughter. The harsher charge carries a maximum penalty of 25 years behind bars.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indicted cops came face to face with Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, who were wounded in the Nov. 25 shooting in Queens.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third detective, Marc Cooper, charged with reckless endangerment, also pleaded not guilty at the arraignment at Queens Supreme Court.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton said the charges weren't enough.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There clearly was evidence to reach the charges of murder and attempted murder,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, intending to say all five cops involved in the shooting should have been charged, said instead, &quot;Clearly, all five officers should have been shot.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He corrected himself, repeating &quot;charged&quot; several times.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was killed and pals Benefield, 23, and Guzman, 31, were wounded in a barrage of police bullets as they sat in a car after leaving Kalua Cabaret, a strip club.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three had been attending a bachelor party for Bell, who was to be married later that day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An eight-count indictment, handed down Friday and unsealed yesterday also accused Oliver, 35, of two counts of first-degree assault and two count of reckless endangerment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If convicted of all charges, he faces 15 to 75 years behind bars, said a spokeswoman for the Queens District Attorney's Office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charges against Isnora, 28, include first- and second-degree assault as well as reckless endangerment. He faces 12 to 57 years in prison if convicted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, 39, who fired four times, was charged with reckless endangerment after one of his bullets went through a window of an occupied AirTrain station across the street from the club. He faces up to a year in prison and/or a $1,000 fine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe this office and this grand jury got the results that were most appropriate,&quot; Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in unsealing the indictment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Michael Carey, who fired three shots, and Officer Paul Headley, who fired one, weren't charged.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Oliver, Isnora and Cooper were suspended without pay, while Carey and Headley were place on modified duty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their supervisor that night, Lt. Gary Napoli - who hid behind a car when the gunfire erupted - was also placed on modified duty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the unsealing of the indictment, the NYPD began an internal probe of the shooting. &quot;Recognizing that the shooting death of an unarmed individual by police has exacerbated relations in the minority community, the Police Department will redouble its efforts to build the best possible relations with all of New York City's diverse communities,&quot; Kelly said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell's parents, William and Valerie Bell, sat in the third row of the courtroom. Valerie Bell wore a button with a picture of her son.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the arraignment, the mother bowed her head, closed her eyes and pressed her hands together as if she were praying.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicole Paultre Bell, who was engaged to Bell and legally took his name after he died, sat in the fourth row.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman, in a wheelchair, and Benefield, using a crutch, also were in the courtroom. At one point, Guzman wheeled himself closer to get a better look at Oliver and then shook his head.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the indictment was read, Valerie Bell began to cry.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three cops, wearing dark suits, stood expressionless.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Randall Eng asked how each defendant was pleading. Lawyer James Culleton, who represents Oliver, said, &quot;Not-guilty plea to all charges.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora's lawyer, Philip Karasyk, &quot;Not guilty of each and every count of the indictment.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Paul Martin, who represents Cooper, said, &quot;The defendant pleads not guilty to each count of the indictment.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eng set bail for Oliver and Isnora at $250,000 bond, or $100,000 cash each, which was posted by the Detectives Endowment Association. Cooper was released without bail.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the courthouse, Paultre Bell said, &quot;Today is just a baby step in the long road that we have ahead of us.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman stood from his wheelchair to reach the microphone.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, we got an indictment. Round One. We've got a hard road to go,&quot; he said. &quot;This was not a victory. It's hollow - that's all it is.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the indictment, DA Brown said he would oppose any change-of-venue attempts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe that you could find a jury that would be more impartial, thorough or fair than you'd find here in Queens County,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if he would consider a plea bargain, Brown said, &quot;I don't know if any offers were made by the attorneys.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton, speaking at his Harlem headquarters, adamantly opposed a plea bargain. &quot;We certainly would hope that they will not entertain in any way, shape or form a plea bargain in this case,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanked by Paultre Bell, Guzman and Benefield, the civil-rights leader said he was equally opposed to a change of venue being sought by advocates for the cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The question of venue change is not only wrong but insulting the intelligence of the public and the intelligence of the court,&quot; he said. &quot;We will not participate in or cooperate with a trial outside of Queens County.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case at its best is a return to grief for all of those involved. This is not a cause for joy, celebration or revenge,&quot; Sharpton added.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paultre Bell broke down and sobbed as she watched Brown announce the charges on TV.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of protesters lined the sidewalk in front of the courthouse. Some carried signs. Others wore clothing with sayings referring to the 50 shots that killed Bell.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters included city Councilman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn), who called for a special prosecutor to push for punishment for all five cops. &quot;This job is incomplete,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three protesters were arrested for sitting on the courthouse steps.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference after the arraignment, Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association, condemned the charges against the cops.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very dark day for the detectives and the NYPD,&quot; he said. &quot;The message that's being sent by these charges is more chilling than I originally thought. I don't know how law-enforcement officers throughout this country can now go to work in confidence.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK -- Three police officers surrendered Monday to face charges in a shooting that killed an unarmed groom on his wedding day and stirred outrage around the city. The officers are accused of firing nearly 50 shots at three young men in a car outside a nightclub, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and seriously wounding two of his friends. Two other officers involved were not indicted. The eight-count indictment charges detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 shots, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said. Those charges are classified as violent felonies with mandated jail time if the men are convicted. The maximum punishment for manslaughter is 25 years, Brown said. Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanor endangerment charge, Brown said. The indictment says Cooper fired a bullet that went through the window of an occupied train station.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO -- Duct tape's success at curing warts may have been overstated, according to a new study that raises doubts about the tape's effectiveness as a cheap, painless treatment. The tape supposedly works by irritating the skin and stimulating the body's immune system to attack the virus that causes warts. It earned a place in the medicine cabinet in 2002, when a small study showed it to be effective on children and young adults. This time, a study among older adults found duct tape helped only 21 percent of the time and was no better than moleskin, a cotton-tape bandage used to protect the skin. But researchers used transparent duct tape. Only later did they learn that the transparent variety does not contain rubber, unlike the better-known, gray duct tape that appeared to be effective in the 2002 study. &quot;Whether or not the standard type of duct tape is effective is up in the air,&quot; said co-author Dr. Rachel Wenner of the University of Minnesota, who started the new study as a medical student. &quot;Theoretically, the rubber adhesive could somehow stimulate the immune system or irritate the skin in a different manner.&quot; The new study appears in the March issue of Archives of Dermatology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Postage increase,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">'forever' stamp OK'd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The cost of mailing a letter will go up by 2 cents on May 14, but you'll be able to lock in that price -- no matter how rates rise in the future -- by buying the new &quot;forever&quot; stamp. The post office governing board agreed Monday to accept the new 41-cent rate for first-class mail recommended in February by the independent Postal Regulatory Commission. The board also agreed to the proposal for the forever stamp, which will always be valid for mailing a letter no matter how much rates increase. James C. Miller III, chairman of the postal board, said the forever stamp could go on sale as soon as next month, at the 41-cent rate. While a forever stamp will always be valid for mailing a letter, that doesn't mean the price won't go up. If rates were to increase to 45 cents, for example, that's what a forever stamp would sell for. But stamps already purchased at a lower rate could still be used without adding extra postage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">At least 78 killed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">in Siberian mine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW -- A methane gas explosion deep in a Siberian coal mine killed at least 78 people and left another 50 trapped Monday in Russia's worst mining disaster in a decade. Among the missing were company officials and safety experts who had been inspecting a British-made hazard-monitoring system, said Sergei Cheremnov, a spokesman for the regional government in Kemerovo where the mine is located, about 1,850 miles east of Moscow. A British man and his interpreter were among those killed, he said. It was unclear what the two were doing in the mine. As many as 200 workers were in the Ulyanovskaya mine when the explosion occurred about 885 feet underground in the coal-rich southern region known as the Kuzbass, emergency and regional officials said. At least 75 people were rescued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Malaria-resistant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">mosquito developed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Re-searchers have developed a malaria-resistant mosquito, a step that might one day help block the spread of an illness that has claimed millions of lives around the world. When they fed on malaria-infected mice, the resistant mosquitoes had a higher survival rate than nonresistant ones, meaning they could eventually replace the ones that can carry the disease, according to a report in today's issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Jason Rasgon of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University cautioned that the research so far is only proof of principle, and any field tests remain far away. Nonetheless, it's a goal eagerly sought by scientists in hope of developing a practical way of blocking the spread of malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Hamas takes credit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">for Israeli's shooting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KARNI CROSSING, Gaza Strip -- Hamas militants on Monday claimed responsibility for a shooting that wounded an Israeli civilian near the border with the Gaza Strip -- the first serious violence after formation of the new Palestinian unity government. The shooting dealt an embarrassing blow to Hamas political leaders, who have been trying to persuade the international community to recognize their coalition with the rival Fatah movement and lift a year-old economic boycott against the Palestinian government. It also exposed divisions within the Islamic militant group. Israel said the attack proved the coalition was flouting international demands to renounce violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and accept past peace accords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Search continues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">for missing Scout</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGRADY, N.C. -- Search crews climbed across a heavily wooded mountain area in western North Carolina on Monday, looking for a 12-year-old boy who disappeared during a weekend camping trip with his Boy Scout troop. Michael Auberry vanished in the rugged terrain surrounding the Blue Ridge Parkway on Saturday after lunch with the other Scouts. Searchers found his mess kit within a mile of the campsite, but no new clues had surfaced Monday, officials said. &quot;We're hopeful he was able to find shelter. There are a number of rock crevasses, and he could have covered himself up with leaves,&quot; said Mike Lambert, a ranger with North Carolina State Parks. Michael was dressed for the weather, his mother said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c8">Election officials in Ohio told to resign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CLEVELAND -- All four election board members for Cuyahoga County, troubled by recount-rigging accusations and voting machine problems, have been told to resign or face being fired, a state official said Monday. Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said she called the four board members of Ohio's most populous county late Sunday, asking them to leave by close of business Wednesday. The county, which includes all of Cleveland, has had difficulty adjusting to electronic voting. Last May's primary, the first attempt at electronic voting in the county, was marred by absent or poorly trained poll workers, lost vote-holding computer cards and a polling place that opened hours late.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, March 19</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three police detectives learned Monday of the criminal charges in their indictment, including manslaughter for two of them, in the fatal shooting of an unarmed groom on his wedding day, a case that stoked public outrage and brought fresh accusations of excessive force against the New York Police Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three officers -- Michael Oliver, Gerard  Isnora and Marc Cooper -- surrendered Monday  morning at the Queens County Courthouse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictments were coolly received by African American leaders in New York, some of whom have called the  killing further evidence of institutional racism at the NYPD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the 23-year-old groom, was black, as are his two friends who were wounded in the November incident. Oliver is white; Isnora and Cooper are black. Two other detectives involved in the incident were not charged; one is white and the other is black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It falls short of what we want,&quot; the Rev. Al Sharpton said at a news conference, standing side by side with the two wounded men and Bell's fiancee. &quot;Clearly, all five officers should be charged; all officers acted in concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three days of deliberations following nearly two months of hearing evidence, the grand jury indicted Oliver, who fired 31 shots, and Isnora, who fired 11 times, on charges of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Monday. The indictment was handed up Friday and unsealed Monday. The charges are classified as violent felonies and carry mandated prison time if the men are convicted. Cooper, who fired four shots, faces lesser misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (R) said Monday that those officers not indicted will face internal police investigations and that the incident has already led the NYPD to &quot;rightly examine several aspects of police operations,&quot; including undercover work and &quot;contagious shooting&quot; by multiple officers. But the upcoming trials, observers said, are nevertheless likely to open fresh wounds for this city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses and the two wounded men, Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23, have told local media that they and Bell were fired upon outside the Kalua Cabaret club in Queens, where Bell's bachelor party had just ended. All three men were unarmed. As they were leaving in their car, they have said, they mistook the plainclothes officer who tried to stop them as a friend of men in the club with whom they had argued. Fearing the man might have a gun, they have said, they tried to speed away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police officers involved have said they thought that  the men were trying to run down the officer, and acted accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are outraged that police officers are being charged for actions taken in the line of duty,&quot; said Paul Martin, Cooper's attorney. &quot;This just isn't right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the overwhelming force used against the unarmed men sparked an uproar and brought to mind past incidents, including the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, by NYPD officers in 1999. And it has put Bloomberg in the difficult position of having to balance support for his police force with public demands for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Bloomberg conceded that &quot;some people will be disappointed in the Grand Jury's decision&quot; but he insisted that it must be respected. &quot;Nothing anyone can do will bring back </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  he said in a statement. &quot;But we can resolve to learn what lessons we can from this tragedy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Three police officers surrendered Monday to face charges in a shooting that killed an unarmed groom on his wedding day and stirred outrage around the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers were accused of firing nearly 50 shots at three young men in a car outside a nightclub, killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and seriously wounding two of his friends. Two other officers involved were not indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight-count indictment charges detectives Michael Oliver, who fired 31 times, and Gescard Isnora, a decorated undercover officer who fired 11 shots, with first-degree and second-degree manslaughter, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those charges are classified as violent felonies with mandated jail time if the men are convicted. The maximum punishment for manslaughter is 25 years, Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a misdemeanor endangerment charge, Brown said. The indictment says he fired a bullet that went through the window of an occupied train station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver also was charged with endangerment in connection with a bullet that went through the window of an occupied house. All three were suspended without pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other policemen were not charged but have been placed on desk duty along with their supervisor as the NYPD continues its internal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a long way from a conviction,&quot; said defense attorney Philip Karasyk, who represents Isnora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case renewed allegations that the NYPD is trigger-happy, as well as accusations of racism. Bell was black, as are the other victims; three of the officers are black, and two are white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton said at a news conference with the wounded men and Bell's fiance that the indictment &quot;falls short of what we want. Clearly, all five officers should be charged; all officers acted in concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Michael Bloomberg acknowledged that some people would be disappointed in the grand jury's decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to respect the result of our justice system,&quot; he said. &quot;Although a trial will decide whether crimes were committed in this case, day in and day out the NYPD does an incredible job under very difficult circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three policemen surrendered to the NYPD's Bureau of Internal Affairs on Monday morning, then were whisked to the Queens court complex. A phalanx of plainclothes law enforcers and family members surrounded them as they were rushed into the building for fingerprinting and processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, all three pleaded not guilty at their arraignment. Sharpton was present in the courtroom, along with shooting survivors Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield. Also attending were Bell's mother and Nicole Paultre Bell, who was engaged to Bell and legally took his name after he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each officer stood, hands clasped, for the entire 20-minute hearing. Oliver and Cooper looked straight ahead; Isnora occasionally bowed his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Supreme Court Justice Randall Eng set bail for Oliver and Isnora at $250,000 bond, or $100,000 cash. Cooper was released without bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said he would oppose any attempts to get a change of venue for the trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury handed down the indictments against the three police officers - Michael Oliver, Gescard Isnora and Marc Cooper - after meeting for more than three months, during which they analysed hundreds of pieces of evidence, from hospital records to videotapes and toxicology reports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the four rounds Marc Cooper, 39, fired during the Nov. 25 Queens shooting did not hit victims Bell, Trent Benefield or Joseph Guzman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His [grand jury] testimony was clear,&quot; said Cooper's lawyer, Paul Martin. &quot;He heard a crash, saw a barrage, crouched down, put one leg out and began firing in the direction of the threat.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield and Guzman, who were wounded in the fusillade, will be in court today to watch as Cooper is arraigned along with Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora, both of whom are charged with manslaughter in the sensational case.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time since the shooting, &quot;Benefield and Guzman will be facing the people who altered their lives forever,&quot; said the Rev. Al Sharpton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil-rights leader said he expects a &quot;very charged atmosphere&quot; in court, where he will be joined by a large group of the victims' relatives and friends.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We intend to maintain our dignity. We'll see how they behave,&quot; Sharpton added, referring to the heavy police presence expected both for crowd control and in support of the detectives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton said he was disturbed when he spotted the front page of yesterday's Post, which showed Oliver leaving celebrity hangout Nello with two women after a $4,200 dinner with pals.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a strange way to prepare for an arraignment,&quot; Sharpton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night of fine dining included five $575 bottles of wine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tab was picked up by Oliver's pal Jos&eacute; Garcia, a big-spending regular at the Chelsea hotspot Cain. The two met there during Oliver's visits as a customer, not while he was working undercover with the vice squad.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least we know he has friends who can help him post bond,&quot; Sharpton said dryly of Oliver.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said that Oliver and Garcia - who lives in Washington, D.C. and works in finance - dined with Cain waitress Laurel Henley and another woman named Toby.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to the Chelsea club scene said Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 shots, spent at least three nights a week at Cain during the grand-jury proceedings. He has since been barred from the club for reasons that include not paying his bar tabs, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver is currently dating former Cain hostess Tara Lee Borsman, who has signed a contract to work at the club's Bahamas location, Cain at the Cove, the sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to reach Oliver were unsuccessful.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Palladino, president of the Detective's Endowment Association, said he didn't appreciate Sharpton's comments.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remind Sharpton that his new clients were partying into the wee hours of the morning in the club Kalua, which is nothing more than a dump overrun with guns, prostitution and drugs,&quot; Palladino said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only Sharpton in his warped mind could draw a nexus between the shooting and Officer Oliver having dinner in a legitimate establishment.&quot;  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) - A military panel found a 101st Airborne soldier guilty of three counts of negligent homicide but not guilty of premeditated murder in the deaths of three Iraqi detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff Sgt. Ray Girouard, 24, smiled as he hugged his defense lawyer and family members after the verdict was read. He faced up to life in prison had he been found guilty of premeditated murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel, which deliberated for four hours, also found Girouard guilty of obstruction of justice for lying to investigators, of conspiracy for trying to conceal the crime and of failure to obey a general order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Girouard could be sentenced to a maximum of 21 years in prison, said his lawyer, Anita Gorecki. He could get a maximum of three years for each negligent homicide charge, five years for the conspiracy charge, five years for obstruction of justice and two years for failure to obey a general order. The sentencing portion of the trial begins Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Girouard was accused of telling his soldiers to release detainees they captured during the May 9 raid near Samarra, Iraq, and then shoot them as they fled. He is the last and most senior soldier from the 101st Airborne Division to face trial in the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Girouard testified during the trial that he lied to investigators about the slayings to protect his soldiers, and that he never told two of his soldiers, Spc. William Hunsaker and Pfc. Corey Clagett, to kill the detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he discovered the slayings, Girouard said, he decided to help them fake an attack, cutting Hunsaker and punching Clagett in the face, and lying to superiors by saying his soldiers shot the detainees in self-defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gorecki stressed in closing arguments Friday that Girouard did not plan the slayings and that prosecutors never provided a motive for Girouard to order the killing during the mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors characterized Girouard as a liar who can't be trusted and that he only changed his story when the other soldiers agreed to make plea agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunsaker, Clagett and another soldier, Spc. Juston Graber, have pleaded guilty to other charges. Hunsaker and Clagett testified that Girouard gave them the orders, while Graber testified that the soldiers were given an option to participate in the plan to kill the detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clagett and Hunsaker pleaded guilty to murder and each were sentenced to 18 years in prison. Graber pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for killing a wounded detainee and was sentenced to nine months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associated Press Writer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (AP) - Two police officers involved in a 50-bullet barrage that killed an unarmed man on his wedding day were indicted on charges of manslaughter, and a third faces a misdemeanor charge, a person familiar with the investigation said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officers were indicted Friday by a grand jury that had deliberated for three days over whether to bring charges in the death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was shot while leaving a bachelor party last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the shots, and Gescard Isnora, who fired 11, face the felony manslaughter charges, according to a person who spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the indictment is sealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces the misdemeanor endangerment charge, the person said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictment is to be unsealed Monday. Lawyers for the three officers said the defendants had been told to surrender then for arraignment. Prosecutors have declined to discuss the grand jury's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police union officials defended the officers in the Bell shooting, arguing they were responding to reasonable suspicions that the victims were armed and dangerous. Supporters said an indictment does not necessarily lead to a conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can indict a ham sandwich or even a rock in the grand jury,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the 15,000-member Detectives Endowment Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury declined to indict on the more serious counts of second-degree murder, or the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision came nearly four months after the shooting, which led to angry protests and raised questions about police tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men who were shot were black. Cooper, 39, and Isnora, 28, are also black; Oliver, 35, is white. Authorities said the other two officers not charged, one black and one white - were not charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is up to the courts now to decide the fate of the three city detectives who were indicted in the death of an unarmed black man in Queens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But another complicated question, one that is unlikely to be fully answered for months, is what the Police Department will do with them, as well with the two other officers who were involved in the fatal shooting but not criminally charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, according to union officials and defense lawyers, a grand jury voted to criminally charge detectives Gescard F. Isnora, Michael Oliver and Marc Cooper in the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who died in a storm of 50 police bullets hours before his wedding in November. The indictment will be unsealed tomorrow. Detectives Isnora and Oliver were charged with manslaughter, people with knowledge of the decision said, and Detective Cooper was charged with reckless endangerment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the shooting, which strained relations between the department and minority communities, all five officers were put on paid leave and had their guns taken away. To defuse critics who demanded that the officers be fired, the department commissioned the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit organization, to independently review its gun training and firearm use. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police officials have refused to immediately disclose what action they will take with the officers. But, in the short term, department stipulations are clear. Because they are criminally charged, the detectives face 30-day suspensions without pay and must surrender their badges. Then they will be put on paid desk jobs, pending the outcome of the trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After that, the department has a range of options: some mandated by police guidelines and state laws; others that will be shaped by what the department's own investigations yield, as well as by how the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, decides to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the detectives are found guilty of felonies, state law requires that they immediately be fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even if the detectives are acquitted, it seems unlikely that their careers will ever be the same, if earlier cases provide any guide. The officers could lose vacation days, be reassigned to endless desk jobs without their guns, or be even fired. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's a very significant range of formal and informal sanctions,'' said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay School of Criminal Justice. ''At the top end, there's criminal conviction with incarceration, which is unlikely,'' he said, explaining that prosecutors often have trouble proving criminal intent when the police shoot someone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Equally unlikely is that they'll ever be back in front-line enforcement,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Take the case of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African immigrant killed by 19 of the 41 bullets fired at him by four officers in 1999. All four officers were indicted but later acquitted. After an internal investigation, the police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, decided not to take disciplinary action against the officers. Still, none were given back their guns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two officers left for the Fire Department, a third retired, and the fourth, Kenneth Boss, recently sued in an effort to be moved from a desk job back to active duty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If acquitted, the three detectives indicted in the Bell shooting could still lose their jobs if police officials determine that the shooting violated the department's guidelines. In 1996, Officer Francis X. Livoti was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in the 1994 death of Anthony Baez. The police commissioner, Howard Safir, decided to fire Officer Livoti nonetheless, after it was determined at a departmental hearing that he used an illegal choke to subdue Mr. Baez. (Mr. Livoti was later sentenced by a federal court to seven-and-a-half years in prison for violating Mr. Baez's civil rights).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you're not found guilty, the department can still internally prosecute them,'' said Rae Koshetz, former deputy police commissioner for trials, and now a lawyer who represents Mr. Boss. ''The standard of proof is different; it's easier to find wrongdoing. So yeah, they can be fired.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the two officers who fired at Mr. Bell's car but were not indicted, Officer Michael Carey and Detective Paul Headley, are not immune from disciplinary action, experts said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Even if the grand jury decides not to indict, that does not mean that it was an appropriate use of deadly force,'' said Joel Berger, who monitored matters of police conduct as an executive in the city's Law Department from 1988 to 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the exact fate awaiting any of the officers is impossible to predict. The department's own investigation of the shooting is not likely to conclude until after the detectives' criminal trial ends.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An undercover detective was indicted by a grand jury for manslaughter not because he fired the shot that killed groom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but because he fired the first shot, The Post has learned.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Queens grand jury agreed with the prosecution's argument that Detective Gescard Isnora should be charged with manslaughter because he was the first of the five cops to open fire outside a Queens strip joint Nov. 25, a court source said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By shooting at Bell and pals Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31, prosecutors say, Isnora created the situation that caused another officer, Michael Oliver, to open fire.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Oliver -  who shot off 31 of the 50 bullets fired by the five cops that tragic day -  has been linked to a slug found during Bell's autopsy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said prosecutors hoped to prove that Isnora's recklessness created a situation that caused &quot;unjustifiable risk of death&quot; and &quot;created the grave cause of the death.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is one standard for manslaughter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the indictments' remaining sealed until tomorrow, several sources have confirmed that both Isnora and Oliver were indicted for manslaughter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another officer, Marc Cooper, was indicted for reckless endangerment, which could be a felony or misdemeanor charge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers who fired their weapons that night do not face charges.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver angrily threatened a Post reporter who asked him a question yesterday about his indictment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Step one foot, and it's 'Game over!' &quot; yelled Oliver as he shoveled snow outside his family home in Clifton, N.J. &quot;I'm gonna ask you nicely. I have no comment. Please leave, OK?&quot;      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post also learned that the stray bullet that shattered a window on a nearby AirTrain elevated platform in Queens was fired by Cooper.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the four bullets Cooper fired hit Bell, Benefield or Guzman, according to Cooper's lawyer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Paul Martin said Cooper, a father of four with 17 years on the job, told the grand jury that he heard cars crashing and a barrage of gunfire before he ducked to the ground and opened fire.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court sources said his bullet was the one captured on a dramatic video that showed a slug landing just inches from two Port Authority cops standing on the AirTrain platform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*  Detective Michael Oliver, 35 -  Manslaughter Fired 31 shots, including bullet that killed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cop charged with shooting 31 of the 50 shots at unarmed groom-to-be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spent the night after getting charged with manslaughter enjoying a lavish $4,200 dinner at celebrity hot spot Nello.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver had an hourlong dinner at 7 p.m. yesterday with four young hotties and the man who picked up the check, Jos&eacute; Garcia, Oliver's friend from Spain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unmarried Oliver was particularly flirty with one foxy brunette, said sources inside the restaurant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was overheard talking about the case, although he didn't appear agitated until he spotted waiting photographers and started talking testily into his cellphone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have nothing to say. I'll see what happens,&quot; he said after exiting the eatery at 62nd Street and Madison Avenue. &quot;I have no comment. Talk to my lawyer.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the women said the group was holding a birthday celebration, but didn't say for whom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They dined on four orders of dover sole, and two plates of pasta with truffles. The latter goes for a whopping $180 a pop. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They washed down the fine food with five $575 bottles of Brunello di Montalcino wine, then closed the meal with a dessert of tiramisu, apple pie and sips of Frangelico. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Garcia settled the tab, which closed out at $4,241.50, Oliver left in a hurry, with one of the sexy table guests in tow, to avoid waiting photographers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then to dodge questions about Bell's death, he ducked behind a building. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debonair bachelor was known as &quot;Undercover Mike&quot; during his days probing the Chelsea club scene as the member of an NYPD Vice Squad cracking down on nightlife crime. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three policemen face charges over the shooting of an unarmed man on his wedding day, their lawyers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was killed and two of his friends wounded in a 50-bullet barrage as they left Bell's stag party at a strip club in the Queens area of New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Marc Cooper, Gerscard Isnora and Michael Oliver said their clients had been indicted, but they did not know what offences they had been charged with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five New York City officers were involved in the incident, but the three who will face charges reportedly fired the most shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper fired four shots; Isnora, 11; and Oliver, 31 - in the 25 November confrontation that killed the 23-year-old. The shooting stirred outrage around New York City and led to accusations of racism against police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell was black, as are two of his friends who were injured in the shooting. Cooper and Isnora are black. Oliver is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District Attorney Richard Brown said that the grand jury had reached a decision and it would be announced on Monday. He gave no reason for the delay, but indictments are often kept sealed until lawyers and their clients are notified and arrangements can be made for the defendants to surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case also brought back painful memories of other infamous police shootings in New York City, including the 1999 killing of unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo, who died in a hail of 41 bullets. The officers in that case were acquitted of criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police union officials defended the officers, arguing they were responding to reasonable suspicions the victims were armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This indictment sends a chilling message to all New York City police officers and to all law enforcement agents throughout the country,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association. &quot;You can act in good faith and there is no margin for error.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three people were arrested after a scuffle broke out with counterprotesters near the end of the 90-minute rally, but no other violence was reported. The event drew about 500 bystanders who booed and held anti-hate signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group chose the small town for the rally in response to a controversy two months ago at a local college.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel promptly announced it wouldn't deal with the coalition, because governing partners Hamas and Fatah stopped short of explicitly recognizing the Jewish state or renouncing violence, as the international community has demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new alliance, which replaced the militantly anti-Israel government led by the Islamic Hamas, appeared to implicitly recognize Israel by calling for a Palestinian state on lands the Israelis captured in 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bush administration found little good to say Saturday about the coalition government, which falls short of Western demands and complicates U.S. plans to revive long-stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former president Arnoldo Aleman, who acknowledged last month he spent $1.8 million in government money on jewelry and meals while seeking hurricane aid abroad in 1998, was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to a 20-year prison term. He was later granted parole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the National Penitentiary System loosened the condition of Aleman's parole that had limited him to the capital, allowing him to travel throughout Nicaragua.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two police officers involved in a 50-bullet barrage that killed an unarmed man on his wedding day were indicted on charges of manslaughter, and a third faces a misdemeanor charge, a person familiar with the investigation said Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Three of the five policemen whose 50-bullet barrage killed an unarmed man on his wedding day were indicted Friday in a case that heightened racial tensions and renewed allegations that the city's officers are too fast on the trigger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys for officers Marc Cooper, Gerscard Isnora and Michael Oliver said their clients had been indicted, but they did not know what offenses the officers had been charged with.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting stirred outrage around New York City and led to accusations of racism against police. Mr. Bell was black, as are two of his friends who were wounded. Officers Cooper and Isnora are black, and Officer Oliver is white.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The storm was blamed for at least two deaths in traffic accidents in Pennsylvania. It also forced school cancellations throughout the Northeast and prompted some government agencies to send workers home early.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three New York City detectives were indicted Friday in connection with the November death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a 50-shot police barrage near a strip club, the officers' attorneys said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queens District Attorney Richard Brown would not disclose the results of the grand jury's work, setting a news conference for Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as lawyers for three of the five officers who fired at Bell's car were contacted about surrendering their clients Monday at the Queens County Courthouse, word circulated that indictments had been handed up against detectives Gescard Isnora, Marc Cooper and Michael Oliver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the grand jury had voted charges of second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment, but it was not clear which charges applied to which detective. It was not clear whether the panel had voted for a charge of first-degree or second-degree reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second-degree manslaughter, upon conviction, carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Reckless endangerment is punishable by up to seven years in prison for first-degree, or up to 12 months in jail for second degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Phil Karasyk said that Isnora, who was the first officer to shoot at Bell's car and who fired 11 times, was charged. Defense attorney James Culleton confirmed that Oliver, who fired 31 shots, had been charged. Paul Martin, who represents Cooper, confirmed his client's indictment. Cooper fired four times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Steven Worth said that his client, Officer Michael Carey, was not charged. Lawyers for Paul Headley, who fired once and was not indicted, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, was killed and two of his friends were seriously wounded in the Nov. 25 shooting near Kalua Cabaret, where Bell -- who was to be married later that day -- celebrated his bachelor party. The three men were unarmed, and no gun was found at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have maintained that they believed one of the men with Bell had a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karasyk said Isnora was disappointed by the indictment, but ''he's stoic. He's firm and he's looking very forward to his day in court.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culleton was unequivocal in his reaction. ''There was no crime committed,'' he said. ''There certainly will be no conviction, in my opinion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''My client is disappointed,'' Martin said of his client, Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worth reiterated that none of the defense attorneys had been told what charges their clients face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secret panel began considering evidence Jan. 22 and heard testimony from more than 60 witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaction from around the city was swift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've been battling since November 25th. Today is a major step in that battle. Who prevails, time will tell. We only ask that the law be abided by,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been a spokesman for Bell's family and the two men wounded in the shooting, Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''These charges, if they are true, those are cases that should be prosecuted and get a conviction,'' said Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. ''That's what this is all about.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a week of mounting tension in southeast Queens, the news that three officers would face criminal charges in the shooting of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came as a relief to Bishop Erskine Williams. He heard it on television yesterday afternoon and could not stop smiling. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think the fever's breaking,'' Bishop Williams said. ''People will be more at ease now.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the same news reached the 103rd Precinct station house, on Police Officer Edward Byrne Avenue, one officer, a 17-year veteran who declined to give his name, said he was sorry to hear it. A jury would see -- he was sure of it -- that Mr. Bell's death, while tragic, was nothing more than an accident. But, he said with resignation, the indictments ''will make the public happy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Word spread through Mr. Bell's Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood by cellphone and television all afternoon: Three officers would face criminal charges in the Nov. 25 death of Mr. Bell, 23, who was killed when police fired more than 50 shots into his car after he left a strip club on the morning of his wedding. Two detectives, Michael Oliver and Gescard F. Isnora, would face manslaughter charges, and a third, Marc Cooper, would be charged with reckless endangerment, two people with direct knowledge of the case said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Baisley Park Houses, where many of Mr. Bell's friends live, people were drinking Champagne out of plastic cups. But in Harlem, the Rev. Al Sharpton looked drained and somber as he stood beside Mr. Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre Bell, at his Harlem headquarters, minutes after the three indictments became public. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The charges are no cause for celebration, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is with no pleasure that we would see their families sitting in a courtroom,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''It is with no joy that we would see them having to do a perp walk. They will never feel the humiliation of a woman waiting for her wedding, and her husband not being there because he was taken in a hail of bullets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is no joy,'' he added. ''There is no vengeance. There is no party here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The grand jury had been meeting for seven weeks, and anxiety built as it neared its conclusion. On Monday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg met with community leaders in a Queens catering hall to discuss how the public might react to the verdict, and 1,700 police officers were on alert all week. By Wednesday, the wait had become agonizing to many. ''There has been a lot of tension,'' said Archie Spigner, who represented southeast Queens on the City Council for 28 years, until 2002. He welcomed news of the indictments, which show, he said, that ''the process works.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's not a happy day, but I urge all of us to have faith in the system,'' he said. ''Now we'll watch and see what comes.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The indictments would restore his neighbors' confidence in the criminal justice system, said Bishop Williams, who is pastor of New Seasons Family Worship Center and a spokesman for Joseph Guzman, 31, and Trent Benefield, 23, the two men who were wounded when Mr. Bell was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We were pretty much of the opinion that the cops pretty much had their way. Whatever they said went,'' he said. ''I think this will sort of restore some trust. It's necessary when you've had this type of egregious act take place. It has to be dealt with, and I think it was.'' Others had similar feelings. Suzanne Mendoza, a nurse's aide who was at McDonald's restaurant on Jamaica Avenue when she heard the news, called the result ''unbelievable.'' She had been convinced there would be no indictments, and said she was shocked to be wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there were few places where the news was greeted more warmly than at the Baisley Park Houses, where Mr. Bell spent a lot of time with his friends. After his death, the police raided the buildings in an effort to gather information about potential witnesses, angering many of its residents. A wall at Baisley Park has been converted into a tribute to Mr. Bell, with a Bible opened to a passage from the book of Amos, which begins, ''Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Friday afternoon progressed into evening, the mood at Baisley Park went from relief to exuberance. An empty bottle of Moet Champagne was set beside the Bible. People ignored the wind and sleet, toasting one another. Nisha Greaves, 18, shook her head and said only, ''I'm happy. I'm happy.'' Darren Goodman stood near the tribute wall, thinking about how Mr. Bell died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This could have happened to anyone here,'' he said. ''It could have happened to me.'' A friend walked up, and Mr. Goodman said, ''Did you hear?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm at a loss for words,'' the friend said. ''I'm at a loss for words.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To legal experts, yesterday's decision reached by a grand jury in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case appeared to be a compromise between those who think the police are too quick to shoot at unarmed black men and those who saw the hail of bullets as the officers' justified efforts to protect their own lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The grand jury brought manslaughter charges against two officers, according to two people with direct knowledge of the case (a third was charged with reckless endangerment, said a person involved in the case). Such charges are themselves relatively rare in police shootings, but while serious and potentially leading to prison terms, they fall far short of the maximum crimes considered, including murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As rare as such indictments are, convictions of on-duty police officers are even more unusual; it has become almost cliche to note that jurors are wary of second-guessing officers' split-second life-and-death decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officers who shot 41 times at Amadou Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment in February 1999 -- an event widely seen as more egregious than the shooting of Mr. Bell and two friends after their car twice rammed a minivan carrying police officers -- were indicted on second-degree murder charges, but were acquitted of all charges at trial. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bryan Conroy, a police officer who shot Ousmane Zongo in a Chelsea warehouse in May 2003, was indicted on second-degree manslaughter charges. But a trial jury deadlocked, and a judge eventually sentenced Officer Conroy to probation on the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide, a Class E felony less serious than the theft of a not particularly expensive car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jurors' approach to police cases, lawyers said, depends on many factors, including politics and race. One lawyer who has defended officers, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of offending black leaders or clients, said the public mood now seemed much calmer than it was after the Diallo shooting, when the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was under fire for its aggressive policing tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As a general rule, depending on the borough, white people tend to be more forgiving of police use of force against black people,'' said Ronald L. Kuby, a civil rights lawyer. ''If the question is, 'How many mistakes are you willing to forgive as long as this cop keeps you safe?' the answer usually is, 'Whatever.' '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now that the indictments are known, lawyers for the three officers facing charges will probably pore over grand jury minutes in search of loopholes or missteps that could help them persuade a judge to reduce the charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps the most critical moments will be in selecting a trial jury, though many officers -- more often than civilian defendants -- opt to leave their fate to a judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It will all depend on the skill of the lawyers in selecting a jury,'' said Mark Jay Heller, a criminal defense lawyer. ''The atmosphere today is a very negative one against law enforcement.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police officers typically attend court proceedings in force to show support for their colleagues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Now the question becomes, 'Would a reasonable police officer in that circumstance come to the same kind of decision-making?' '' said John Patten, a lawyer who represented Sean Carroll, one of the officers acquitted in the Diallo case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first on-duty officer in New York convicted of homicide was Thomas Ryan in 1977. He was charged with depraved-indifference murder in the July 1975 beating death of Israel Rodriguez, a burglary suspect, in a Bronx station house. A jury convicted him of criminally negligent homicide, a far lesser charge. A judge sentenced Officer Ryan to four years in prison, but he vanished, spending two years in hiding before turning himself in in 1981, saying that he was not guilty but tired of running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawyers familiar with such proceedings said the Bell grand jury appeared to be following a blueprint laid out by the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, who is regarded as a politically astute prosecutor whose preferred course is moderation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They expressed surprise that the 23-member grand jury was in session for about two and a half months -- much longer than the usual week or two -- handing down indictments nearly four months after Mr. Bell was killed on Nov. 25 when the police fired 50 shots into his car outside a nightclub on his wedding day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alan Vinegrad, a former United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, who was a lead prosecutor in the Abner Louima police brutality case, said intentional murder charges against the officers in the Bell case were always less likely than in Diallo. ''You could argue there was greater justification for reacting in some way,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Vinegrad also said police shootings tended to defy the cynical adage that a prosecutor can get grand jurors to indict a ham sandwich. ''They tend to scrutinize those cases more carefully, because they are so counterintuitive,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One lawyer said the grand jury almost seemed to be counting the shots fired in making its decisions, with those who fired the fewest considered reasonable while those who shot first (Detective Gescard F. Isnora) and most (Detective Michael Oliver) facing more serious charges than Detective Marc Cooper, who fired four times. Detective Paul Headley, who fired once, and Officer Michael Carey, who fired three times, were not indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's all about shots,'' said Stephen C. Worth, Officer Carey's lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reckless manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of five to 15 years. Mr. Kuby said it is the equivalent, in legal terms, of getting behind the wheel of a car knowing the brakes are shot, or driving while intoxicated -- which is not viewed the same way as someone who intentionally kills another human being.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A grand jury voted yesterday to indict three city police detectives -- two black men and a white man -- in the killing of an unarmed 23-year-old black man who died in a burst of 50 police bullets outside a Queens strip club hours before he was to be wed last year, defense lawyers and police union leaders said last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The jury charged two of the detectives -- Gescard F. Isnora, an undercover officer who fired the first shot, and Michael Oliver, who fired 31 shots -- with manslaughter, two people with direct knowledge of the case said. The third detective, Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a lesser charge of reckless endangerment, those two people said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Isnora and Cooper are black; Detective Oliver is white. They were among five police officers who fired into a gray Nissan Altima carrying the bridegroom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two friends during a chaotic confrontation in Jamaica early on the morning of Nov. 25. Neither Mr. Bell nor his friends, both of whom were wounded, were armed, although the police officers apparently believed that they were. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The grand jury reached its decision after three days of deliberations and nearly two months of hearing evidence in an emotionally charged case whose stark outlines -- five officers firing 50 bullets at three unarmed men who had been out celebrating -- prompted an outpouring of anger in some minority communities, and widespread comparisons to the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African street peddler who was felled by 19 of 41 police officers' bullets fired at him in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The grand jurors, who dispersed into the wintry afternoon yesterday, indicted the three officers on less-serious charges than the second-degree murder charges filed against the four police officers who shot Mr. Diallo. All four were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was unclear whether Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, sought the indictment of the other two officers who fired at Mr. Bell, Detective Paul Headley, 35, who fired one shot, and Officer Michael Carey, 26, who fired three shots. All five of the officers testified voluntarily before the grand jury without immunity from prosecution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brown scheduled a news conference on Monday morning. Lawyers for the indicted detectives said they had been told to have the men surrender on Monday -- the next day that State Supreme Court in Queens is in session. Mr. Brown's office, which would not confirm the indictments, said the grand jury's decision had to remain sealed until at least one officer was formally charged in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The person with direct knowledge of the case who said Detectives Isnora and Oliver faced manslaughter charges did not know if they were first- or second-degree counts. Second-degree manslaughter is defined as recklessly causing the death of another person. First-degree manslaughter is defined as causing the death of a person while intending to cause serious physical injury to that person or causing the death of a third person under those circumstances. The three officers may also face additional lesser charges. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some leaders in the black community expressed muted optimism as news of the indictments spread late yesterday, while others felt the indictments did not go far enough. In Jamaica, some detected a sense of relief that at least some of the officers would face charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As long as I know that somebody got something, I can live with that,'' said Bishop Lester Williams, who was to officiate at Mr. Bell's wedding on the day he died. ''I have some degree of relief.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If there had been no indictments, he said, ''you have groups out there that would not have been calm. The youth of this city would have responded.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawyers for the indicted officers criticized the grand jury's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Philip E. Karasyk, who represents Detective Isnora, said, ''Obviously, my client is upset, and he's looking forward to having his day in court, and we're all confident he will be vindicated.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Paul P. Martin, a lawyer for Detective Cooper, 39, said: ''I am disappointed with the grand jury's decision, but this is just the first stage of a long process, and I am confident that once all the facts are considered by a jury of Detective Cooper's peers that he will be exonerated of all charges.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  James J. Culleton, the lawyer for Detective Oliver, said the indictment ''was not unexpected -- a grand jury presentation is one-sided,''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I firmly believe that he will be found not guilty,&quot; he said of Detective Oliver, 35, who, with Detective Isnora, 28, were considered the most vulnerable to criminal charges. Detective Oliver fired far and away the most bullets, emptying one magazine, reloading and emptying a second, and Detective Isnora opened fire first, touching off the 50-shot barrage. Detective Isnora fired 11 shots, emptying his gun. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael J. Palladino, the president of the Detectives Endowment Association, confirmed the indictments but said he did not know the charges and would not know them until Monday, when they were unsealed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I know the grand jury worked very long and very hard on this particular case,'' Mr. Palladino said at a late-afternoon press conference, surrounded by officials of his association. ''I respect their decision. However I firmly disagree with the decision to indict these officers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Palladino predicted that the jury's vote would have a chilling effect on police officers in the city and nationwide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The message that's being sent now is that even though you're acting in good faith, in pursuit of your lawful duties, there is no room, no margin for error,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer for Officer Michael Carey, described the moment he learned his client had not been indicted: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Worth said he got a call from Charles Testagrossa, the prosecutor who presented evidence to the grand jury, who ''told me there was no true bill as to my guy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Obviously,'' he said, ''we are gratified by the grand jury's decision as to Mike, and I have always believed that he acted professionally on the night of this incident.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police Department procedures call for the suspension of officers who are charged with a crime, and the three detectives will be ordered to surrender their shields; all five officers are already on paid leave without their weapons. Those who are suspended will be unpaid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If indictments of police officers are unusual, convictions are even more so. Many saw a jury's decision to acquit the officers who opened fire on Mr. Diallo after a two-month trial as a firm rejection of the powerful charges against them. In recent years in New York City, Bryan Conroy, a police officer who shot a peddler in a Chelsea warehouse had faced second-degree manslaughter charges, but was convicted of the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide by a judge, who sentenced him to probation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detectives indicted in the Bell case were in a larger group seeking prostitution arrests outside the Club Kalua, a topless bar in Jamaica that had been plagued by narcotics and prostitution activity, under-age drinking and guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora had trailed Mr. Bell's party, which was broken into two groups of four men, believing that Joseph Guzman, one of Mr. Bell's companions, had a gun and was about to use it, according to a person familiar with the detective's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The detective approached Mr. Bell's car. But Mr. Bell drove forward, clipping him, and then hit a police minivan, backed up, nearly hitting the detective again and slammed into the minivan a second time, the police have said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detective Isnora, with his shield around his neck, said he opened fire, according to the person familiar with his account. This led to the fusillade of shots, with some of the officers apparently believing that their colleagues' muzzle flashes were those of assailants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bell was killed as he sat in the driver's seat. Trent Benefield, 23, who was in the passenger seat, was struck three times, in the leg and buttock, and Mr. Guzman, 31, who was in a back seat, had at least 11 bullet wounds along his right side, from his neck to his feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like the officers, the wounded men told their stories before the grand jury. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Protests that followed the shooting were mostly peaceful. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg convened a meeting of black religious leaders and elected officials at City Hall. He emerged from it calling the circumstances ''inexplicable'' and ''unacceptable,'' and said, ''It sounds to me like excessive force was used.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bloomberg's quick reaction was viewed as a salve to the situation and a turnabout from the approach of his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who did not reach out to black leaders in the immediate aftermath of the fatal shooting of Mr. Diallo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The panel of grand jurors began its work on Jan. 22 and met as often as three times a week in an auditorium-style room in an office building in Kew Gardens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The officers testified in the reverse order of the number of rounds they fired: Detective Headley and Officer Carey testified on March 5; Detectives Cooper and Isnora, testified on March 7; and Friday last week, Detective Oliver testified in the zenith of the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Deliberations seemed to move slowly and in fits and starts. After Mr. Testagrossa read the charge -- the instructions on the law that the panel had to consider as it weighed the evidence -- the panelists were left alone to deliberate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of a grand jury's decision yesterday to indict three police officers in the shooting death of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the state penal code's wording on the use of deadly force.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force,&quot; the penal code says.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops who fired 50 shots at Bell's car Nov. 25 said they unloaded after the driver tried to run them over and after one cop saw a passenger reach for something in his waistband.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell and two friends wounded in the shooting were unarmed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said it is against department policy to fire at a car being used as a weapon. Kelly also said cops are taught not to fire more than three shots at a time without pausing to assess the situation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last 13 years, three NYPD cops have been convicted of criminal charges for shooting in the line of duty.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case of &quot;friendly fire,&quot; Officer Peter DelDebbio, who is white, mistakenly shot black undercover Officer Desmond Robinson four times in the back on Aug. 22, 1994, on a subway platform. He was convicted of second-degree assault.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer Paolo Colecchia, 45, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in a non-jury trial for the July 4, 1996, shooting death of an unarmed man in a Bronx subway station.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Officer Bryan Conroy was convicted of criminally negligent homicide in connection with the May 22, 2003, shooting death of a West African immigrant inside a Chelsea storage warehouse.    </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three NYPD cops were indicted yesterday for firing 46 of 50 shots at three unarmed men in a car on a Queens street last year - wounding two and killing a groom just hours before his wedding.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After three anxious days of deliberations, a Queens grand jury reached its decision against three of the five officers involved in the shooting, which sparked charges of police brutality and set back relations between the police and the black community.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although District Attorney Richard Brown said the grand jury's decision was sealed and would not be announced until Monday, sources and a lawyer for one of the indicted officers confirmed that the charges had been handed up.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives Michael Oliver, Marc Cooper and Gescard Isnora were indicted, according to lawyers for each of the cops.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges against them were not immediately clear. The possibilities, according to the DA's office, included attempted murder, manslaughter and reckless endangerment, all felonies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel included eight blacks, seven whites, and a mix of Hispanics and Asians.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can indict a ham sandwich or even a rock in the grand jury,&quot; said Michael Palladino, the president of the Detectives Endowment Association.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper, who fired four shots at Bell's car Nov. 25, was at home with his wife and family when he heard the news from his lawyer, Paul Martin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He believes he acted responsibly and professionally,&quot; Martin said. &quot;I did not think my client had any criminal responsibility.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said Isnora, who blew his cover to confront Bell and his friends after a bachelor party at a Jamaica strip club, fired 11 shots.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oliver reportedly unloaded 31 shots, including some after he had reloaded.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're both very disappointed,&quot; said Oliver's lawyer, James Culleton. &quot;It's a tragedy for everyone.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just the beginning of the process,&quot; said Isnora's lawyer, Philip Karasyk. &quot;It's one thing to be in a warm room asking questions and not making split-second decisions on the street.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Al Sharpton, a spokesman for Bell's fianc&eacute;e, Nicole Paultre-Bell, was measured in his response, saying he'd wait until Monday's announcement to give a detailed press conference.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was joined by Trent Benefield, 23, and Joseph Guzman, 31, who were seriously wounded during the shooting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Charges are not convictions,&quot; Sharpton said. &quot;And convictions, even then, cannot bring back </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and cannot repair the damage to Joe and Trent.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharpton even invoked the memories of two auxiliary police officers who were shot to death on a Greenwich Village street Wednesday night.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the ugliest things that occurred was the killings of these auxiliary police officers,&quot; Sharpton said at his Harlem headquarters. &quot;But it is just as ugly for the police to break the law and shoot </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefield's mother, Denise Ford, said she'll be happier if the indictments turn into convictions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to leave it God's hands,&quot; she said, adding that she's &quot;hoping for&quot; justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 23-member panel deliberated for three days before reaching its decision. One of those days was interrupted by last-minute testimony from a janitor, who, according to sources, claimed to have seen a &quot;fourth man&quot; shoot at the cops and flee.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although detectives thought the testimony would help the officers' case, it didn't. The three indicted cops will face trial on charges that could, if they're convicted of the top counts, put them behind bars for a minimum of seven years each.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other officers, Michael Carey and Paul Headley, were not charged. Headley fired one shot. Carey fired three.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My client feels relieved and vindicated,&quot; said Stephen Worth, Carey's lawyer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department brass said the status of the five officers involved remains unchanged until Monday's official announcement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that the three officers indicted will turn over their badges and guns. The two officers who were not indicted could conceivably be restored to duty, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NYPD has marshaled extra forces to contend with any fallout from the announcements. Mayor Bloomberg said the mobilization was just a precaution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever the grand jury says . . . I think you will see the people of this city behaving in an exemplary manner,&quot; Bloomberg said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can be disappointed; they can express themselves . . . But nobody is going to go out and make our streets unsafe.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger was beginning to boil among black leaders after the surprise witness resurrected the cop-friendly &quot;fourth man&quot; theory. But early reaction to the indictments in the city's black communities was mixed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a step,&quot; said Ben Wolf, 38, a resident of the Baisley Park Gardens apartments, where Benefield lives, and where a makeshift memorial to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still stands.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm glad it's going down like this. We need justice. Now my kids can be safe,&quot; Wolf said. &quot;Responsibility is very important. I teach my kids about responsibility and justice, that you can't just do something and get away with it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other's felt the indictments didn't go far enough.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody should have gotten indicted,&quot; said Felix Ebron, 49, a Harlem photographer. &quot;It wasn't just three officers who did the shooting. I'm outraged. If it happened to him, it can also happen to me.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers throughout the city had anxiously awaited the decision. Many were disappointed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I respect their decision but firmly disagree,&quot; Palladino said. &quot;I don't think the actions of the detectives rise to a criminal level. The message will have a chilling effect not only here but throughout the country.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One veteran officer said the charges would make police officers hesitant in dangerous situations, a delay that could cost some their lives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a tragic state of affairs, considering they're not even paying these guys decent money to start,&quot; said the officer, a supervisor.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bell, 23, and his friends were on their way home from a bachelor party at a strip club in South Jamaica where an undercover cop reportedly saw someone with a gun.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, an officer reportedly heard Guzman say, &quot;Yo, get my gun,&quot; during an argument between Bell's party and a man outside the club. The cop called for backup, approached the friends' car, and began to unload when Bell, who was driving, began to pull away.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One officer said he saw a passenger reach for something in his waistband. No weapons were found.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guzman took 16 of the 50 bullets, which left 19 holes in his body.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't even have a pair of scissors in the car,&quot; Guzman said after he was released from the hospital.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN open letter to Mayor Bloomberg:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Mayor, I believe you are a great mayor - apart from the fact that you want cops and firefighters to live on all the free water they can drink.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's incendiary and cancerous assaults on cops, even unarmed auxiliaries, surely hurts both our souls.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cops are getting shot, stabbed and mauled all over the city - and now we're looking to put them away over the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tragedy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was certainly reasonable for a grand jury to meet over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who was killed the night before he was going to get married.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Mr. Mayor, somehow, someway, you, I and the cops who were there all know that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death was a cataclysmic case of the wrong guy in the wrong place. It wasn't murder - nor was it manslaughter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of the horrific shooting, you set the tone with a knee-jerk remark that the force used by the cops was &quot;excessive&quot; - and now we have three indictments.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Patten, the lead attorney for the four cops charged but acquitted in the sad death of Amadou Diallo, told me the other day: &quot;The number of shots fired has nothing to do with a case. Those cops believed the shots being fired were a risk to their lives or their colleagues' lives.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Number of shots means nothing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't deserve to die.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Mr. Mayor - with great respect - the very same cops that the city pays below the poverty level shouldn't be exposed to doing prison time.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yeah, you're a great mayor, but I'm glad I'm not a cop or a firefighter.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike, make it right. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can dress up Al Sharpton in $2,000 suits and take him off to high-life hotspots like Nello's, but at the end of the day he's still Al Sharpton - a mean-spirited, self-aggrandizing disgrace to New York City.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How silly to think that time might have mellowed the sweatsuited perpetrator of the Tawana Brawley fraud. How wrong to think he might have taken a lesson from his role in the Freddy's Fashion Mart arson that killed seven innocent people back in 1995.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's moral conscience?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is to laugh.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the indictments of three NYPD officers in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case was hardly an hour old yesterday when Sharpton saw fit to throw fuel on this latest fire - gratuitously terming the Bell tragedy &quot;just as ugly&quot; as the mad, methodical massacre of two unarmed auxiliary cops Wednesday in Greenwich Village.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicholas Pekearo and Eugene Marshalik were sought out and deliberately executed. It's all on videotape.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was part of a group of young men partying at a skeezy Queens dive that was under police investigation for alleged drug and gun violations and prostitution. Detectives opened fire when he drove his car straight at undercover cops.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To equate the events is beyond invidious - it's obscene, even for Sharpton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indictments will be opened Monday. But let's be clear: Whatever they allege, Queens DA Richard Brown is going to have a very heavy lift proving that the accused cops committed a crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least in any way that will stand up on appeal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As New Yorkers learned during the Amadou Diallo trial seven years ago, the law anticipates the passions that have surrounded this case - indeed, it anticipates the efforts of rabble-rousing bottom-feeders like Al Sharpton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is to say, as a matter of law, police officers have an explicit right to use deadly force if they have reasonable cause to fear for their lives.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why the cops in the Diallo case wound up being acquitted on all counts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York will learn on Monday what's in the indictments handed up against Detectives Gescard Isnora, the first to fire his weapon that night, after he was struck by Bell's car; Marc Cooper, who shot four times; and Michael Oliver, who fired 31 of the 50 rounds expended.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, that's a lot of bullets.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as New Yorkers learned during the Diallo trial, under the law it doesn't really matter how many shots were fired.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the first shot - the one fired in response to a perceived mortal threat in a split-second judgment - that counts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now a jury will decide whether the cops had reasonable cause to believe their lives were being threatened.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the Diallo case, we don't believe these officers should be facing charges at all - because the next time a cop in a similar situation finds himself hesitating, even for a second, for fear of possibly being hauled into court, it could well cost him his life.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the NYPD as a whole will suffer, too - if officers are unwilling to do their jobs correctly and with appropriate aggressiveness because they fear legal consequences.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bell's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> death was a tragedy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it wasn't a crime.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shame on Al Sharpton for saying otherwise. Not that he knows what shame is. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Associated Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Three of the five policemen whose 50-bullet barrage killed an unarmed man on his wedding day were indicted Friday in a case that heightened racial tensions and renewed allegations that the city's officers are too fast on the trigger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys for officers Marc Cooper, Gerscard Isnora and Michael Oliver said their clients had been indicted, but they did not know what offenses the officers had been charged with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three officers fired the most shots - Cooper, 4, Isnora, 11, and Oliver, 31 - in the Nov. 25 confrontation that killed 23-year-old </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and wounded two of his friends as they left Bell's bachelor party at a strip club in Queens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shooting stirred outrage around New York City and led to accusations of racism against police. Bell was black, as are two of his friends who were wounded in the shooting. Cooper and Isnora are black. Oliver is white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">District Attorney Richard A. Brown said only that the grand jury had reached a decision and it would be announced Monday. He gave no reason for the delay, but indictments are often kept sealed until attorneys and their clients are notified and arrangements can be made for the defendants to surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person familiar with the case told the AP that the other two officers in the shooting - one black and one white - were not charged. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the grand jury's decision has not been made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case also brought back painful memories of other infamous police shootings in New York City, including the 1999 killing of unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo, who died in a hail of 41 bullets. The officers in that case were acquitted of criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police union officials defended the officers, arguing they were responding to reasonable suspicions the victims were armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This indictment sends a chilling message to all New York City police officers and to all law enforcement throughout the country,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association. &quot;You can act in good faith and there is no margin for error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isnora, 28, was &quot;very upset,&quot; attorney Philip Karasyk said. &quot;But he is confident that once he has his day in court he will be vindicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury's decision came after three days of deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anticipation has been running high around New York City about the grand jury's decision. Extra police officers were put on standby, and the mayor met with black leaders in the Queens neighborhood where the shooting occurred in hopes of defusing any tensions that might arise from the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever the grand jury says ... I think you will see the people of this city behaving in an exemplary manner,&quot; Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT WAS a bad week for heroes and superheroes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Wednesday night David Garvin, a part-time film-maker, entered a pizzeria in New York's Greenwich Village and shot one of its employees, Alfredo Romero, 15 times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was chased by two unarmed auxiliary police officers (volunteers who might normally direct traffic or help tourists with directions). Garvin turned around and shot and killed them both. He stood over 19-year-old Eugene Marshalik as he shot him in the back of the head. Garvin was eventually shot 56 times by full-time police officers after pointing a gun at them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night before, a police officer was shot by a man in a Harlem restaurant. That man was eventually killed by police officers. And the previous weekend, an off-duty police officer shot a 21-year-old man after another off-duty officer was shot in the foot during a fight in a nightclub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime in New York City has plummeted dramatically since the early 1990s, but for one week it seemed like a return to the dark, crime-ridden streets of Gotham City, where criminals rule the streets and police wage a losing battle against dark forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same week, a grand jury indicted three police officers for killing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had fired 50 shots into his car as he was leaving a nightclub after his bucks night. He was due to be married that day. He was unarmed. The indictment of the police officers is rare for New York, even though they regularly shoot offenders. Juries have historically given police officers wide licence - some in the black community say far too wide - to shoot first and ask questions later. And given the ubiquity of guns, it's impossible not to feel for police officers who potentially put themselves in the line of fire every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One column in The New York Times cast these events in the light of the never-ending debate about race relations and policing but, to the outsider, what all these events have in common is guns. Crime may be down but the US remains a trigger-happy society. Instead of sparking a debate about gun control, such violence seems to drive more people to own a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York is one of the few parts of the US with a political orthodoxy against the free and easy ownership of guns. One of the unwritten rules of being mayor of New York is that you go to the site of a police shooting, you go to the hospital when police officers are injured, and you go to the funerals. In other words, it's hard to avoid the damage that guns do. It's what Rudy Giuliani did when he was mayor, and what Michael Bloomberg does now. When Giuliani was mayor, he campaigned for a ban on assault weapons and pointed out that in many states it was easier to get a gun licence than a driver's licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg has spent much of his second term as Mayor of New York travelling the country to get the support of other big-city mayors for gun control, and suing 27 out-of-state gun dealers. New York City alleges that the dealers sold firearms illegally to undercover private investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous Republican Congress responded to this by passing a law that prohibited local governments from using tracking data to trace the ownership of guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomberg zeroed in on the gun laws after the murder of the two police volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is just a point that we have to say: 'Enough.' You can't keep losing police officers and kids,&quot; he said. &quot;Day in and day out, it's our children getting killed. It's our police officers getting killed. It could be you and me getting killed. Somebody's got to stop this craziness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on the day of the shooting rampage in Greenwich Village, a comic book hit the streets in which Captain America was shot dead by a sniper as he was leaving a courtroom. Not even a patriotic superhero is immune to America's crazy love of guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, his death may be short-lived, because in the comic book universe the quickest way to revive a flagging franchise is to kill off the hero, then bring them back from the dead. It's a pity you can't do that to real-life police officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Claude Lewis, The Philadelphia Inquirer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENTARY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City, whether it likes it or not, has earned a name for a particularly ugly kind of police crime, in which officers use particularly ugly or excessive force in attacking unarmed black men. There's no reason to believe it's going to end soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reputation is stronger among minorities than among whites (but thereby hangs a tale). Such attacks do not, it is true, happen terribly often _ but for some things, once in a while is far too much. Why? Because their excess bespeaks the racial impasse that persists in our culture, and because they are so ugly they stick in the collective unconscious. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such crimes begin with a group of nervous undercover officers who approach a minority male. Something goes criminally wrong. What follows is outrage among minority citizens (mostly), sometimes led by itinerant leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who are persuaded that these things happen exclusively in their neighborhoods. Months later, suits are filed; sometimes indictments follow, and ultimately there are trials. Finally _ and in most instances _ the police are acquitted of all charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three examples:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_A Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, was abused with a broom handle in a Brooklyn police precinct in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_Another immigrant, Amadou Diallo, was shot in the vestibule of his apartment building in February 1999. He dies unarmed in a hail of 41 police bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23, also weaponless, was shot to death last fall in Queens on the morning of his wedding day. About 50 bullets were spent in the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three officers were indicted last week in the killing of Bell, who had been celebrating with friends outside a nightclub. Two of his friends were also shot, but survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each case, there are claims of extenuating circumstances. In each case, it is claimed the police had no choice. In Bell's case, the officers testified before a grand jury that he gunned his car and struck at least one of them in his attempt to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is fair _ more than fair _ to note that New York got this reputation after former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani prompted his police department to alter its crime-fighting techniques. In 1994 Giuliani and then-police commissioner William Bratton ordered their &quot;elite&quot; Street Crimes Unit to confiscate illegal weapons from pedestrians through a program of stop and search. Charges flew of civil-rights violations and increased police shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 33,000 people were stopped on New York City's streets in 1997 and 1998, according to police data. The actual number stopped will never be known because many citizens were stopped and frisked and found not to be carrying unlicensed weapons. Most were sent on their way, and no paperwork or record of the intrusion was filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people, considering this issue, will say, &quot;Of course, this is too much&quot;; others will wonder what the fuss is about. That, too, bespeaks our racial impasse. As mentioned, excessive brutality isn't actually routine. But try telling that to families of victims. Police seldom use their stop-and-search policies in wealthy or middle-class communities, so people from those communities don't see a problem. In New York and elsewhere, minorities bear the brunt, and their cries of brutality or harassment are largely dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is left is a deep sense of hopelessness _ and fear _ on the part of minority communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has to be a better way to patrol the streets. We all know that the streets of most big cities are crowded by people who break the law. But we have to maintain our values without capriciously shooting down citizens who pose no threat, who endanger no one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a free society, the police are governed by law. In other societies, the police are the law. In such nations, citizens do not have a Fourth Amendment to protect their right &quot;to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.&quot; Under the U.S. Constitution, we have those protections in place, even if they are not recognized by everyone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A GRAND JURY has voted to indict three city police detectives in the killing of an unarmed 23-year-old black man who died in a burst of 50 police bullets outside a strip club hours before he was to be married last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jury charged two of the detectives - Gescard Isnora, an undercover officer who fired the first shot, and Michael Oliver, who fired 31 shots - with manslaughter. The third detective, Marc Cooper, who fired four shots, faces a lesser charge of reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They and two other officers fired into a Nissan carrying the bridegroom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sean Bell,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and two friends during a chaotic confrontation in Jamaica, Queens, in the early hours of November 25. Neither Mr Bell nor his friends, who were both wounded, were armed, although the officers apparently believed they were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jury reached its decision on Friday after three days of deliberations and nearly two months of hearing evidence in an emotionally charged case whose stark outlines - five officers firing 50 bullets at three unarmed men who had been out celebrating - prompted an outpouring of anger in some minority communities, and widespread comparisons to the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African street peddler felled by 19 of 41 police officers' bullets fired at him in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grand jurors, who dispersed into the wintry afternoon on Friday, indicted the three officers on less serious charges than the second-degree murder charges filed against the four police officers who shot Mr Diallo. All four of them were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear whether Richard Brown, the Queens district attorney, sought the indictment of the other two officers who fired at Mr Bell, Paul Headley, 35, who fired one shot, and Michael Carey, 26, who fired three shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All five officers testified voluntarily before the grand jury without immunity from prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some black leaders expressed muted optimism as news of the indictments spread late on Friday, while others said they felt the indictments did not go far enough.</SPAN></P>
